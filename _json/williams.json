I wonder if\n              they're lovers?\nThey don't look it. Right now, in fact, they look a wreck, careening hap-\n              hazardly along,\ncontriving, as they reach beneath me, to dip a wheel from the curb so\n              that the chair skewers, teeters,\ntips, and they both tumble, the one slowly, almost gracefully sliding in\n              stages from his seat,\nhis expression hardly marking it, the other staggering over him, spinning\n              heavily down,\nto lie on the asphalt, his mouth working, his feet shoving weakly and\n              fruitlessly against the curb.\nIn the storefront office on the corner, Reed and Son, Real Estate, have\n              come to see the show.\nGazing through the golden letters of their name, they're not, at least,\n              thank god, laughing.\nNow the buddy, grabbing at a hydrant, gets himself erect and stands\n              there for a moment, panting.\nNow he has to lift the other, who lies utterly still, a forearm shielding his\n              eyes from the sun.\nHe hauls him partly upright, then hefts him almost all the way into the\n              chair, but a dangling foot\ncatches a support-plate, jerking everything around so that he has to put\n              him down,\nset the chair to rights, and hoist him again and as he does he jerks the\n              grimy jeans right off him.\nNo drawers, shrunken, blotchy thighs: under the thick, white coils of\n              belly blubber,\nthe poor, blunt pud, tiny, terrified, retracted, is almost invisible in the\n              sparse genital hair,\nthen his friend pulls his pants up, he slumps wholly back as though he\n              were, at last, to be let be,\nand the friend leans against the cyclone fence, suddenly staring up at me\n              as though he'd known,\nall along, that I was watching and I can't help wondering if he knows that\n              in the winter, too,\nI watched, the night he went out to the lot and walked, paced rather, \n              almost ran, for how many hours.\nIt was snowing, the city in that holy silence, the last we have, when the\n              storm takes hold,\nand he was making patterns that I thought at first were circles, then real-\n              ized made a figure eight,\nwhat must have been to him a perfect symmetry but which, from where\n              I was, shivered, bent,\nand lay on its side: a warped, unclear infinity, slowly, as the snow came\n              faster, going out.\nOver and over again, his head lowered to the task, he slogged the path\n              he'd blazed,\nbut the race was lost, his prints were filling faster than he made them\n              now and I looked away,\nup across the skeletal trees to the tall center city buildings, some, though\n              it was midnight,\nwith all their offices still gleaming, their scarlet warning beacons signal-\n              ing erratically\nagainst the thickening flakes, their smoldering auras softening portions of\n              the dim, milky sky.\nIn

unadorned.", "SHAME": "A girl who, in 1971, when I was living by myself, painfully lonely, bereft, depressed,\noffhandedly mentioned to me in a conversation with some friends that although at first she\u2019d found \n\tme--\n\nI can\u2019t remember the term, some dated colloquialism signifying odd, unacceptable, out-of-things--\nshe\u2019d decided that I was after all all right ... twelve years

and I am taken with a terrible humiliation.", "TAR": "The first morning of Three Mile Island: those first disquieting, uncertain, mystifying hours.\nAll morning a crew of workmen have been tearing the old decrepit roof off our building,\nand all morning, trying to distract myself, I\u2019ve been wandering out to watch them\nas they hack away the leaden layers of asbestos paper and disassemble the disintegrating drains.\nAfter half a night of listening to the news, wondering how to know a hundred miles downwind\nif and when to make a run for it and where, then a coming bolt awake at seven\nwhen the roofers we\u2019ve been waiting for since winter sent their ladders shrieking up our wall,\nwe still know less than nothing: the utility company continues making little of the accident,\nthe slick federal spokesmen still have their evasions in some semblance of order.\nSurely we suspect now we\u2019re being lied to, but in the meantime, there are the roofers,\nsetting winch-frames, sledging rounds of tar apart, and there I am, on the curb across, gawking.\n\nI never realized what brutal work it is, how matter-of-factly and harrowingly dangerous.\nThe ladders flex and quiver, things skid from the edge, the materials are bulky and recalcitrant.\nWhen the rusty, antique nails are levered out, their heads pull off; the underroofing crumbles.\nEven the battered little furnace, roaring along as patient as a donkey, chokes and clogs,\na dense, malignant smoke shoots up, and someone has to fiddle with a cock, then hammer it,\nbefore the gush and stench will deintensify, the dark, Dantean broth wearily subside.\nIn its crucible, the stuff looks bland, like licorice, spill it, though, on your boots or coveralls,\nit sears, and everything is permeated with it, the furnace gunked with burst and half-burst bubbles,\nthe men themselves so completely slashed and mucked they seem almost from another realm, like trolls.\nWhen they take their break, they leave their brooms standing at attention in the asphalt pails,\nwork gloves clinging like Br\u2019er Rabbit to the bitten shafts, and they slouch along the precipitous lip,\nthe enormous sky behind them, the heavy noontime air alive with shimmers and mirages.\n\nSometime in the afternoon I had to go inside: the advent of our vigil was upon us.\nHowever much we didn\u2019t want to, however little we would do about it, we\u2019d understood:\nwe were going to perish of all this, if not now, then soon, if not soon, then someday.\nSomeday, some final generation, hysterically aswarm beneath an atmosphere as unrelenting as rock,\nwould rue us all, anathematize our earthly comforts, curse our surfeits and submissions.\nI think I know, though I might rather not, why my roofers stay so clear to me and why the rest,\nthe terror of that time, the reflexive disbelief and distancing, all we should hold on to, dims so.\nI remember the president in his absurd protective booties, looking absolutely unafraid, the fool.\nI remember a woman on the front page glaring across the misty Susquehanna at those looming stacks.\nBut, more vividly, the men, silvered with glitter from the shingles, clinging like starlings beneath the eaves.\nEven the leftover carats of tar in the gutter, so black they seemed to suck the light out of the air.\nBy nightfall kids had come across them: every sidewalk on the block was scribbled with obscenities and hearts.", "metadata": "williams|C.
