{"THE WINDOWS": "Lord, how can man preach thy eternal word?\n    He is a brittle crazy glass;\nYet in thy temple thou dost him afford\n    This glorious and transcendent place,\n    To be a window, through thy grace.\n\nBut when thou dost anneal in glass thy story,\n    Making thy life to shine within\nThe holy preachers, then the light and glory\n    More reverend grows, and more doth win;\n    Which else shows waterish, bleak, and thin.\n\nDoctrine and life, colors and light, in one\n    When they combine and mingle, bring\nA strong regard and awe; but speech alone\n    Doth vanish like a flaring thing,\n    And in the ear, not conscience, ring.", "THE AFFLICTION": "When first thou didst entice to thee my heart,\nI thought the service brave;\nSo many joys I writ down for my part,\nBesides what I might have\nOut of my stock of natural delights,\nAugmented with thy gracious benefits.\n\nI looked on thy furniture so fine,\nAnd made it fine to me;\nThy glorious household-stuff did me entwine,\nAnd 'tice me unto thee.\nSuch stars I counted mine: both heav'n and earth;\nPaid me my wages in a world of mirth.\n\nWhat pleasures could I want, whose King I serv'd,\nWhere joys my fellows were?\nThus argu'd into hopes, my thoughts reserv'd\nNo place for grief or fear.\nTherefore my sudden soul caught at the place,\nAnd made her youth and fierceness seek thy face.\n\nAt first thou gav'st me milk and sweetnesses;\nI had my wish and way;\nMy days were straw'd with flow'rs and happiness;\nThere was no month but May.\nBut with my years sorrow did twist and grow,\nAnd made a party unawares for woe.\n\nMy flesh began unto my soul in pain,\n\"Sicknesses cleave my bones;\nConsuming agues dwell in ev'ry vein,\nAnd tune my breath to groans.\"\nSorrow was all my soul; I scarce believ'd,\nTill grief did tell me roundly, that I liv'd.\n\nWhen I got health, thou took'st away my life,\nAnd more, for my friends die;\nMy mirth and edge was lost, a blunted knife\nWas of more use than I.\nThus thin and lean without a fence or friend,\nI was blown through with ev'ry storm and wind.\n\nWhereas my birth and spirit rather took\nThe way that takes the town;\nThou didst betray me to a ling'ring book,\nAnd wrap me in a gown.\nI was entangled in the world of strife,\nBefore I had the power to change my life.\n\nYet, for I threaten'd oft the siege to raise,\nNot simp'ring all mine age,\nThou often didst with academic praise\nMelt and dissolve my rage.\nI took thy sweet'ned pill, till I came where\nI could not go away, nor persevere.\n\nYet lest perchance I should too happy be\nIn my unhappiness,\nTurning my purge to food, thou throwest me\nInto more sicknesses.\nThus doth thy power cross-bias me, not making\nThine own gift good, yet me from my ways taking.\n\nNow I am here, what thou wilt do with me\nNone of my books will show;\nI read, and sigh, and wish I were a tree,\nFor sure then I should grow\nTo fruit or shade: at least some bird would trust\nHer household to me, and I should be just.\n\nYet, though thou troublest me, I must be meek;\nIn weakness must be stout;\nWell, I will change the service, and go seek\nSome other master out.\nAh my dear God!
