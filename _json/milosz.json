{"ACCOUNT": "The history of my stupidity would fill many volumes.\n\nSome would be devoted to acting against consciousness,\nLike the flight of a moth which, had it known,\nWould have tended nevertheless toward the candle\u2019s flame.\n\nOthers would deal with ways to silence anxiety,\nThe little whisper which, though it is a warning, is ignored.\n\nI would deal separately with satisfaction and pride,\nThe time when I was among their adherents\nWho strut victoriously, unsuspecting.\n\nBut all of them would have one subject, desire,\nIf only my own--but no, not at all; alas,\nI was driven because I wanted to be like others.\nI was afraid of what was wild and indecent in me.\n\nThe history of my stupidity will not be written.\nFor one thing, it\u2019s late. And the truth is laborious.", "ARS POETICA?": "I have always aspired to a more spacious form   \nthat would be free from the claims of poetry or prose   \nand would let us understand each other without exposing   \nthe author or reader to sublime agonies.   \n\nIn the very essence of poetry there is something indecent:   \na thing is brought forth which we didn\u2019t know we had in us,   \nso we blink our eyes, as if a tiger had sprung out   \nand stood in the light, lashing his tail.   \n\nThat\u2019s why poetry is rightly said to be dictated by a daimonion,   \nthough it\u2019s an exaggeration to maintain that he must be an angel.   \nIt\u2019s hard to guess where that pride of poets comes from,   \nwhen so often they\u2019re put to shame by the disclosure of their frailty.   \n\nWhat reasonable man would like to be a city of demons,   \nwho behave as if they were at home, speak in many tongues,   \nand who, not satisfied with stealing his lips or hand,   \nwork at changing his destiny for their convenience?   \n\nIt\u2019s true that what is morbid is highly valued today,   \nand so you may think that I am only joking   \nor that I\u2019ve devised just one more means   \nof praising Art with the help of irony.   \n\nThere was a time when only wise books were read,   \nhelping us to bear our pain and misery.   \nThis, after all, is not quite the same   \nas leafing through a thousand works fresh from psychiatric clinics.   \n\nAnd yet the world is different from what it seems to be   \nand we are other than how we see ourselves in our ravings.\nPeople therefore preserve silent integrity,   \nthus earning the respect of their relatives and neighbors.   \n\nThe purpose of poetry is to remind us   \nhow difficult it is to remain just one person,   \nfor our house is open, there are no keys in the doors,   \nand invisible guests come in and out at will.\n\nWhat I'm saying here is not, I agree, poetry,   \nas poems should be written rarely and reluctantly,   \nunder unbearable duress and only with the hope   \nthat good spirits, not evil ones, choose us for their instrument.", "DEDICATION": "You whom I could not save\nListen to me.   \nTry to understand this simple speech as I would be ashamed of another.   \nI swear, there is in me no wizardry of words.   \nI speak to you with silence like a cloud or a tree.\n\nWhat strengthened me, for you was lethal.   \nYou mixed up farewell to an epoch with the beginning of a new one,   \nInspiration of hatred with lyrical beauty;   \nBlind force with accomplished shape.\n\nHere is a valley of shallow Polish rivers. And an immense bridge   \nGoing into white fog. Here is a broken city;   \nAnd the wind throws the screams of gulls on your grave   \nWhen I am talking with you.\n\nWhat is poetry which does not save   \nNations or people?   \nA connivance with official lies,   \nA song of drunkards whose throats will be cut in a moment,   \nReadings for sophomore girls.\nThat I wanted good poetry without knowing it,   \nThat I discovered, late, its salutary aim,   \nIn this and only this I find salvation.\n\nThey used to pour millet on graves or poppy seeds   \nTo feed the dead who would come disguised as birds.   \nI put this book here for you, who once lived   \nSo that you should visit us no more.", "ENCOUNTER": "We were riding through frozen fields in a wagon at dawn.\nA red wing rose in the darkness.\n\nAnd suddenly a hare ran across the road.\nOne of us pointed to it with his hand.\n\nThat was long ago.
