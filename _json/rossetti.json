on steps of Heaven alone?\n    If Saints and Angels spoke of love\n    Should I not answer from my throne?\n    Have pity upon me ye my friends\n    For I have heard the sound thereof:\n    Should I not turn with yearning eyes\n    Turn earthwards with a pitiful pang?\n    O save me from a pang in Heaven!\n    By all the gifts we took and gave\n    Repent repent and be forgiven:\n    This life is

what I dreamed last night:\n    A spirit with transfigured face\n    Fire-footed clomb an infinite space.\n    I heard his hundred pinions clang\n    Heaven-bells rejoicing rang and rang\n    Heaven-air was thrilled with subtle scents\n    Worlds spun upon their rushing cars:\n    He mounted shrieking: \"Give me light!\"\n    Still light was poured on him more light;\n    Angels Archangels he outstripped\n    Exultant in exceeding might\n    And trod the skirts of Cherubim.\n    Still \"Give me light\" he shrieked; and dipped\n\n    His thirsty face and drank a sea\n    Athirst with thirst it could not slake.\n    I saw him drunk with knowledge take\n    From aching brows the aureole crown--\n    His locks writhed like a cloven snake--\n    He left his throne to grovel down\n    And lick the dust of Seraphs' feet:\n    For what is knowledge duly weighed?\n    Knowledge is strong but love is sweet;\n    Yea all the progress he had made\n    Was but to learn that all is small\n    Save love for love is all in all.\n\n      I tell you what I dreamed last night:\n    It was not dark it was not light\n    Cold dews had drenched my plenteous hair\n    Through clay; you came to seek me there.\n    And \"Do you dream of me?\" you said.\n    My heart was dust that used to leap\n    To you; I answered half asleep:\n    \"My pillow is damp my sheets are red\n    There's a leaden tester to my bed:\n    Find you a warmer playfellow\n    A warmer pillow for your head\n    A kinder love to love than mine.\"\n    You wrung your hands; while I like lead\n    Crushed downwards through the sodden earth:\n    You smote your hands but not in mirth\n    And reeled but were not drunk with wine.\n\n      For all night long I dreamed of you:\n    I woke and prayed against my will\n    Then slept to dream of you again.\n    At length I rose and knelt and prayed:\n    I cannot write the words I said\n    My words were slow my tears were few;\n    But through the dark my silence spoke\n    Like thunder. When this morning broke\n    My face was pinched my hair was gray\n    And frozen blood was on the sill\n    Where stifling in my struggle I lay.\n\n      If now you saw me you would say:\n    Where is the face I used to love?\n    And I would answer: Gone before;\n    It tarries veiled in Paradise.\n    When once the morning star shall rise\n    When earth with shadow flees away\n    And we stand safe within the door\n    Then you shall lift the veil thereof.\n    Look up rise up: for far above\n    Our palms are grown our place is set;\n    There we shall meet as once we met\n    And love with old familiar love.", "UP-HILL": "    Does the road wind up-hill all the way?\n      Yes to the very end.\n    Will the day's journey take the whole long day?\n      From morn to night my friend.\n\n    But is there for the night a resting-place?\n      A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.\n    May not the darkness hide it from my face?\n      You cannot miss that inn.\n\n    Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?\n      Those who have gone before.\n    Then must I knock or call when just in sight?\n      They will not keep you standing at that door.\n\n    Shall I find comfort travel-sore and weak?\n      Of labor you shall find the sum.\n    Will there be beds for me and all who seek?\n      Yea beds for all who come.\n\n\n\n\n    \"THE LOVE OF CHRIST WHICH PASSETH KNOWLEDGE.\"\n\n\n    I bore with thee long weary days and nights\n      Through many pangs of heart through many tears;\n    I bore with thee thy hardness coldness slights\n      For three and thirty years.\n\n    Who else had dared for thee what I have dared?\n      I plunged the depth most deep from bliss above;\n    I not My flesh I not My spirit spared:\n      Give thou Me love for love.\n\n    For thee I thirsted in the daily drouth\n      For thee I trembled in the nightly frost:\n    Much sweeter thou than honey to My mouth:\n      Why wilt thou still be lost?\n\n    I bore thee on My shoulders and rejoiced:\n      Men only marked upon My shoulders borne\n    The branding cross; and shouted hungry-voiced\n      Or wagged their heads in scorn.\n\n    Thee did nails grave upon My hands thy name\n      Did thorns for frontlets stamp between Mine eyes:\n    I Holy One put on thy guilt and shame;\n      I God Priest Sacrifice.\n\n    A thief upon My right hand and My left;\n      Six hours alone athirst in misery:\n    At length in death one smote My heart and cleft\n      A hiding-place for thee.\n\n    Nailed to the racking cross than bed of down\n      More dear whereon to stretch Myself and sleep:\n    So did I win a kingdom--share My crown;\n      A harvest--come and reap.\n\n\n\n    \"A BRUISED REED SHALL HE NOT BREAK.\"\n\n\n    I will accept thy will to do and be\n      Thy hatred and intolerance of sin\n    Thy will at least to love that burns within\n      And thirsteth after Me:\n    So will I render fruitful blessing still\n      The germs and small beginnings in thy heart\n      Because thy will cleaves to the better part.--\n        Alas I cannot will.\n\n    Dost not thou will poor soul?

undulating green\n      Stately with trees whose shadows slept below\n    With glimpses of smooth garden-beds between\n      Like flame or sky or snow.\n\n    Swift squirrels on the pastures took their ease\n      With leaping lambs safe from the unfeared knife;\n    All singing-birds rejoicing in those trees\n      Fulfilled their careless life.\n\n    Wood-pigeons cooed there stock-doves nestled there;\n      My trees were full of songs and flowers and fruit\n    Their branches spread a city to the air\n      And mice lodged in their root.\n\n    My heath lay farther off where lizards lived\n      In strange metallic mail just spied and gone;\n    Like darted lightnings here and there perceived\n      But nowhere dwelt upon.\n\n    Frogs and fat toads were there to hop or plod\n

corners out of sight;\n    I never marred the curious sudden stool\n      That perfects in a night.\n\n    Safe in his excavated gallery\n      The burrowing mole groped on from year to year;\n    No harmless hedgehog curled because of me\n      His prickly back for fear.\n\n    Ofttimes one like an angel walked with me\n      With spirit-discerning eyes like flames of fire\n    But deep as the unfathomed endless sea\n      Fulfilling my desire:\n\n    And sometimes like a snowdrift he was fair\n      And sometimes like a sunset glorious red\n    And sometimes he had wings to scale the air\n      With aureole round his head.\n\n    We sang our songs together by the way\n      Calls and recalls and echoes of delight;\n    So communed we together all the day\n      And so in dreams by night.\n\n    I have no words to tell what way we walked\n      What unforgotten path now closed and sealed;\n    I have no words to tell all things we talked\n      All things that he revealed:\n\n    This only can I tell: that hour by hour\n      I waxed more feastful lifted up and glad;\n    I felt no thorn-prick when I plucked a flower\n      Felt not my friend was sad.\n\n    \"To-morrow\" once I said to him with smiles:\n      \"To-night\" he answered gravely and was dumb\n    But pointed out the stones that numbered miles\n      And miles and miles to come.\n\n    \"Not so\" I said: \"to-morrow shall be sweet;\n      To-night is not so sweet as coming days.\"\n    Then first I saw that he had turned his feet\n      Had turned from me his face:\n\n    Running and flying miles and miles he went\n      But once looked back to beckon with his hand\n    And cry: \"Come home O love from banishment:\n      Come to the distant land.\"\n\n    That night destroyed me like an avalanche;\n      One night turned all my summer back to snow:\n    Next morning not a bird upon my branch\n      Not a lamb woke below--\n\n    No bird no lamb no living breathing thing;\n      No squirrel scampered on my breezy lawn\n    No mouse lodged by his hoard: all joys took wing\n      And fled before that dawn.\n\n    Azure and sun were starved from heaven above\n      No dew had fallen but biting frost lay hoar:\n    O love I knew that I should meet my love\n      Should find my love no more.\n\n    \"My love no more\" I muttered stunned with pain:\n      I shed no tear I wrung no passionate hand\n    Till something whispered: \"You shall meet again\n      Meet in a distant land.\"\n\n    Then with a cry like famine I arose\n      I lit my candle searched from room to room\n    Searched up and down; a war of winds that froze\n      Swept through the blank of gloom.\n\n    I searched day after day night after night;\n      Scant change there came to me of night or day:\n    \"No more\" I wailed \"no more\"; and trimmed my light\n      And gnashed but did not pray\n\n    Until my heart broke and my spirit broke:\n      Upon the frost-bound floor I stumbled fell\n    And moaned: \"It is enough: withhold the stroke.\n      Farewell O love farewell.\"\n\n    Then life swooned from me. And I heard the song\n      Of spheres and spirits rejoicing over me:\n    One cried: \"Our sister she hath suffered long.\"--\n      One answered: \"Make her see.\"--\n\n    One cried: \"O blessed she who no more pain\n      Who no more disappointment shall receive.\"--\n    One answered: \"Not so: she must live again;\n      Strengthen thou her to live.\"\n\n    So while I lay entranced a curtain seemed\n      To shrivel with crackling from before my face\n    Across mine eyes a waxing radiance beamed\n      And showed a certain place.\n\n    I saw a vision of a woman where\n      Night and new morning strive for domination;\n    Incomparably pale and almost fair\n      And sad beyond expression.\n\n    Her eyes were like some fire-enshrining gem\n      Were stately like the stars and yet were tender\n    Her figure charmed me like a windy stem\n      Quivering and drooped and slender.\n\n    I stood upon the outer barren ground\n      She stood on inner ground that budded flowers;\n    While circling in their never-slackening round\n      Danced by the mystic hours.\n\n    But every flower was lifted on a thorn\n      And every thorn shot upright from its sands\n    To gall her feet;

since:\n    Tedious land for a social Prince;\n    Halting he scanned the outs and ins\n      Endless labyrinthine grim\n    Of the solitude that made him wince\n      Laying wait for him.\n\n    By bulging rock and gaping cleft\n    Even of half mere daylight reft\n    Rueful he peered to right and left\n      Muttering in his altered mood:\n    \"The fate is hard that weaves my weft\n        Though my lot be good.\"\n\n    Dim the changes of day to night\n    Of night scarce dark to day not bright.\n    Still his road wound towards the right\n      Still he went and still he went\n    Till one night he spied a light\n        In his discontent.\n\n    Out it flashed from a yawn-mouthed cave\n    Like a red-hot eye from a grave.\n    No man stood there of whom to crave\n      Rest for wayfarer plodding by:\n    Though the tenant were churl or knave\n        The Prince might try.\n\n    In he passed and tarried not\n    Groping his way from spot to spot\n    Towards where the cavern flare glowed hot:--\n      An old old mortal cramped and double\n    Was peering into a seething-pot\n        In a world of trouble.\n\n    The veriest atomy he looked\n    With grimy fingers clutching and crooked\n    Tight skin a nose all bony and hooked\n      And a shaking sharp suspicious way;\n    Blinking his eyes had scarcely brooked\n        The light of day.\n\n    Stared the Prince for the sight was new;\n    Stared but asked without more ado:\n    \"May a weary traveller lodge with you\n      Old father here in your lair?\n    In your country the inns seem few\n        And scanty the fare.\"\n\n    The head turned not to hear him speak;\n    The old voice whistled as through a leak\n    (Out it came in a quavering squeak):\n      \"Work for wage is a bargain fit:\n    If there's aught of mine that you seek\n        You must work for it.\n\n    \"Buried alive from light and air\n    This year is the hundredth year\n    I feed my fire with a sleepless care\n      Watching my potion wane or wax:\n    Elixir of Life is simmering there\n        And but one thing lacks.\n\n    \"If you're fain to lodge here with me\n    Take that pair of bellows you see--\n    Too heavy for my old hands they be--\n      Take the bellows and puff and puff:\n    When the steam curls rosy and free\n        The broth's boiled enough.\n\n    \"Then take your choice of all I have;\n    I will give you life if you crave.\n    Already I'm mildewed for the grave\n      So first myself I must drink my fill:\n    But all the rest may be yours to save\n        Whomever you will.\"\n\n    \"Done\" quoth the Prince and the bargain stood.\n    First he piled on resinous wood\n    Next plied the bellows in hopeful mood;\n      Thinking \"My love and I will live.\n    If I tarry why life is good\n        And she may forgive.\"\n\n    The pot began to bubble and boil;\n    The old man cast in essence and oil\n    He stirred all up with a triple coil\n      Of gold and silver and iron wire\n    Dredged in a pinch of virgin soil\n        And fed the fire.\n\n    But still the steam curled watery white;\n    Night turned to day and day to night;\n    One thing lacked by his feeble sight\n      Unseen unguessed by his feeble mind:\n    Life might miss him but Death the blight\n        Was sure to find.\n\n    So when the hundredth year was full\n    The thread was cut and finished the school.\n    Death snapped the old worn-out tool\n      Snapped him short while he stood and stirred\n    (Though stiff he stood as a stiff-necked mule)\n        With never a word.\n\n    Thus at length the old crab was nipped.\n    The dead hand slipped the dead finger dipped\n    In the broth as the dead man slipped--\n      That same instant a rosy red\n    Flushed the steam and quivered and clipped\n        Round the dead old head.\n\n    The last ingredient was supplied\n    (Unless the dead man mistook or lied).\n    Up started the Prince he cast aside\n      The bellows plied through the tedious trial\n    Made sure that his host had died\n        And filled a phial.\n\n    \"One night's rest\" thought the Prince. \"This done\n    Forth I speed with the rising sun:\n    With the morrow I rise and run\n      Come what will of wind or of weather.\n    This draught of Life when my Bride is won\n        We'll drink together.\"\n\n    Thus the dead man stayed in his grave\n    Self-chosen the dead man in his cave;\n    There he stayed were he fool or knave\n      Or honest seeker who had not found;\n    While the Prince outside was prompt to crave\n        Sleep on the ground.\n\n    \"If she watches go bid her sleep;\n    Bid her sleep for the road is steep:\n    He can sleep who holdeth her cheap\n      Sleep and wake and sleep again.\n    Let him sow one day he shall reap\n        Let him sow the grain.\n\n    \"When there blows a sweet garden rose\n    Let it bloom and wither if no man knows:\n    But if one knows when the sweet thing blows\n      Knows and lets it open and drop\n    If but a nettle his garden grows\n        He hath earned the crop.\"\n\n    Through his sleep the summons rang\n    Into his ears it sobbed and it sang.\n    Slow he woke with a drowsy pang\n      Shook himself without much debate\n    Turned where he saw green branches hang\n        Started though late.\n\n    For the black land was travelled o'er\n    He should see the grim land no more.\n    A flowering country stretched before\n      His face when the lovely day came back:\n    He hugged the phial of Life he bore\n        And resumed his track.\n\n    By willow courses he took his path\n    Spied what a nest the kingfisher hath\n    Marked the fields green to aftermath\n      Marked where the red-brown field-mouse ran\n    Loitered awhile for a deep-stream bath\n        Yawned for a fellow-man.\n\n    Up on the hills not a soul in view\n    In the vale not many nor few;\n    Leaves still leaves and nothing new.\n      It's O for a second maiden at least\n    To bear the flagon and taste it too\n        And flavor the feast.\n\n    Lagging he moved and apt to swerve;\n    Lazy of limb but quick of nerve.\n    At length the water-bed took a curve\n      The deep river swept its bank-side bare;\n    Waters streamed from the hill-reserve--\n        Waters here waters there.\n\n    High above and deep below\n    Bursting bubbling swelling the flow\n    Like hill-torrents after the snow--\n      Bubbling gurgling in whirling strife\n    Swaying sweeping to and fro--\n        He must swim for his life.\n\n    Which way?--which way?--his eyes grew dim\n    With the dizzying whirl--which way to swim?\n    The thunderous downshoot deafened him;\n      Half he choked in the lashing spray:\n    Life is sweet and the grave is grim--\n        Which way?--which way?\n\n    A flash of light a shout from the strand:\n    \"This way--this way; here lies the land!\"\n    His phial clutched in one drowning hand;\n      He catches--misses--catches a rope;\n    His feet slip on the slipping sand:\n        Is there life?--is there hope?\n\n    Just saved without pulse or breath--\n    Scarcely saved from the gulp of death;\n    Laid where a willow shadoweth--\n      Laid where a swelling turf is smooth.\n    (O Bride! but the Bridegroom lingereth\n        For all thy sweet youth.)\n\n    Kind hands do and undo\n    Kind voices whisper and coo:\n    \"I will chafe his hands\"--\"and I\"--\"and you\n      Raise his head put his hair aside.\"\n    (If many laugh one well may rue:\n        Sleep on thou Bride.)\n\n    So the Prince was tended with care:\n    One wrung foul ooze from his clustered hair;\n    Two chafed his hands and did not spare;\n      But one propped his head that drooped awry\n    Till his eyes oped and at unaware\n        They met eye to eye.\n\n    O a moon face in a shadowy place\n    And a light touch and a winsome grace\n    And a thrilling tender voice which says:\n      \"Safe from waters that seek the sea--\n    Cold waters by rugged ways--\n        Safe with me.\"\n\n    While overhead bird whistles to bird\n    And round about plays a gamesome herd:\n    \"Safe with us\"--some take up the word--\n      \"Safe with us dear lord and friend:\n    All the sweeter if long deferred\n        Is rest in the end.\"\n\n    Had he stayed to weigh and to scan\n    He had been more or less than a man:\n    He did what a young man can\n    Spoke of toil and an arduous way--\n    Toil to-morrow while golden ran\n        The sands of to-day.\n\n    Slip past slip fast\n    Uncounted hours from first to last\n    Many hours till the last is past\n      Many hours dwindling to one--\n    One hour whose die is cast\n        One last hour gone.\n\n    Come gone--gone forever--\n    Gone as an unreturning river--\n    Gone as to death the merriest liver--\n      Gone as the year at the dying fall--\n    To-morrow to-day yesterday never--\n        Gone once for all.\n\n    Came at length the starting-day\n    With last words and last last words to say\n    With bodiless cries from far away--\n      Chiding wailing voices that rang\n    Like a trumpet-call to the tug and fray;\n        And thus they sang:\n\n    \"Is there life?--the lamp burns low;\n    Is there hope?--the coming is slow:\n    The promise promised so long ago\n      The long promise has not been kept.\n    Does she live?--does she die?--she slumbers so\n        Who so oft has wept.\n\n    \"Does she live?--does she die?--she languisheth\n    As a lily drooping to death\n    As a drought-worn bird with failing breath\n      As a lovely vine without a stay\n    As a tree whereof the owner saith\n        'Hew it down to-day.'\"\n\n    Stung by that word the Prince was fain\n    To start on his tedious road again.\n    He crossed the stream where a ford was plain\n      He clomb the opposite bank though steep\n    And swore to himself to strain and attain\n        Ere he tasted sleep.\n\n    Huge before him a mountain frowned\n    With foot of rock on the valley ground\n    And head with snows incessant crowned\n      And a cloud mantle about its strength\n    And a path which the wild goat hath not found\n        In its breadth and length.\n\n    But he was strong to do and dare:\n    If a host had withstood him there\n    He had braved a host with little care\n      In his lusty youth and his pride\n    Tough to grapple though weak to snare.\n        He comes O Bride.\n\n    Up he went where the goat scarce clings\n    Up where the eagle folds her wings\n    Past the green line of living things\n      Where the sun cannot warm the cold--\n    Up he went as a flame enrings\n        Where there seems no hold.\n\n    Up a fissure barren and black\n    Till the eagles tired upon his track\n    And the clouds were left behind his back--\n      Up till the utmost peak was past.\n    Then he gasped for breath and his strength fell slack;\n        He paused at last.\n\n    Before his face a valley spread\n    Where fatness laughed wine oil and bread\n    Where all fruit-trees their sweetness shed\n      Where all birds made love to their kind\n    Where jewels twinkled and gold lay red\n        And not hard to find.\n\n    Midway down the mountain side\n    (On its green slope the path was wide)\n    Stood a house for a royal bride\n      Built all of changing opal stone\n    The royal palace till now descried\n        In his dreams alone.\n\n    Less bold than in days of yore\n    Doubting now though never before\n    Doubting he goes and lags the more:\n      Is the time late? does the day grow dim?\n    Rose will she open the crimson core\n        Of her heart to him?\n\n    Above his head a tangle glows\n    Of wine-red roses blushes snows\n    Closed buds and buds that unclose\n      Leaves and moss and prickles too;\n    His hand shook as he plucked a rose\n        And the rose dropped dew.\n\n    Take heart of grace! the portion of Life\n    May go far to woo him a wife:\n    If she frown yet a lover's strife\n      Lightly raised can be laid again:\n    A hasty word is never the knife\n        To cut love in twain.\n\n    Far away stretched the royal land\n    Fed by dew by a spice-wind fanned:\n    Light labor more and his foot would stand\n      On the threshold all labor done;\n    Easy pleasure laid at his hand\n        And the dear Bride won.\n\n    His slackening steps pause at the gate--\n    Does she wake or sleep?--the time is late--\n    Does she sleep now or watch and wait?\n      She has watched she has waited long\n    Watching athwart the golden grate\n        With a patient song.\n\n    Fling the golden portals wide\n    The Bridegroom comes to his promised Bride;\n    Draw the gold-stiff curtains aside\n      Let them look on each other's face\n    She in her meekness he in his pride--\n        Day wears apace.\n\n    Day is over the day that wore.\n    What is this that comes through the door\n    The face covered the feet before?\n      This that coming takes his breath;\n    This Bride not seen to be seen no more\n        Save of Bridegroom Death?\n\n    Veiled figures carrying her\n    Sweep by yet make no stir;\n    There is a smell of spice and myrrh\n      A bride-chant burdened with one name;\n    The bride-song rises steadier\n        Than the torches' flame:\n\n    \"Too late for love too late for joy\n      Too late too late!\n    You loitered on the road too long\n      You trifled at the gate:\n    The enchanted dove upon her branch\n        Died without a mate;\n    The enchanted princess in her tower\n      Slept died behind the grate;\n    Her heart was starving all this while\n        You made it wait.\n\n    \"Ten years ago five years ago\n      One year ago\n    Even then you had arrived in time\n      Though somewhat slow;\n    Then you had known her living face\n      Which now you cannot know:\n    The frozen fountain would have leaped\n      The buds gone on to blow\n    The warm south wind would have awaked\n        To melt the snow.\n\n    \"Is she fair now as she lies?\n      Once she was fair;\n    Meet queen for any kingly king\n      With gold-dust on her hair.\n    Now these are poppies in her locks\n      White poppies she must wear;\n    Must wear a veil to shroud her face\n      And the want graven there:\n    Or is the hunger fed at length\n        Cast off the care?\n\n    \"We never saw her with a smile\n      Or with a frown;\n    Her bed seemed never soft to her\n      Though tossed of down;\n    She little heeded what she wore\n      Kirtle or wreath or gown;\n    We think her white brows often ached\n      Beneath her crown\n    Till silvery hairs showed in her locks\n      That used to be so brown.\n\n    \"We never heard her speak in haste:\n      Her tones were sweet\n    And modulated just so much\n      As it was meet:\n    Her heart sat silent through the noise\n      And concourse of the street.\n    There was no hurry in her hands\n      No hurry in her feet;\n    There was no bliss drew nigh to her\n      That she might run to greet.\n\n    \"You should have wept her yesterday\n      Wasting upon her bed:\n    But wherefore should you weep to-day\n      That she is dead?\n    Lo we who love weep not to-day\n      But crown her royal head.\n    Let be these poppies that we strew\n      Your roses are too red:\n    Let be these poppies not for you\n      Cut down and spread.\"", "MAIDEN-SONG": "    Long ago and long ago\n      And long ago still\n    There dwelt three merry maidens\n      Upon a distant hill.\n    One was tall Meggan\n      And one was dainty May\n    But one was fair Margaret\n      More fair than I can say\n    Long ago and long ago.\n\n    When Meggan plucked the thorny rose\n      And when May pulled the brier\n    Half the birds would swoop to see\n      Half the beasts draw nigher;\n    Half the fishes of the streams\n      Would dart up to admire:\n    But when Margaret plucked a flag-flower\n      Or poppy hot aflame\n    All the beasts and all the birds\n      And all the fishes came\n    To her hand more soft than snow.\n\n    Strawberry leaves and May-dew\n      In brisk morning air\n    Strawberry leaves and May-dew\n      Make maidens fair.\n    \"I go for strawberry-leaves\"\n      Meggan said one day:\n    \"Fair Margaret can bide at home\n      But you come with me May;\n    Up the hill and down the hill\n      Along the winding way\n    You and I are used to go.\"\n\n    So these two fair sisters\n      Went with innocent will\n    Up the hill and down again\n      And round the homestead hill:\n    While the fairest sat at home\n      Margaret like a queen\n    Like a blush-rose like the moon\n      In her heavenly sheen\n    Fragrant-breathed as milky cow\n      Or field of blossoming bean\n    Graceful as an ivy bough\n      Born to cling and lean;\n    Thus she sat to sing and sew.\n\n    When she raised her lustrous eyes\n      A beast peeped at the door;\n    When she downward cast her eyes\n      A fish gasped on the floor;\n    When she turned away her eyes\n      A bird perched on the sill\n    Warbling out its heart of love\n      Warbling warbling still\n    With pathetic pleadings low.\n\n    Light-foot May with Meggan\n      Sought the choicest spot\n    Clothed with thyme-alternate grass:\n      Then while day waxed hot\n    Sat at ease to play and rest\n      A gracious rest and play;\n    The loveliest maidens near or far\n      When Margaret was away\n    Who sat at home to sing and sew.\n\n    Sun-glow flushed their comely cheeks\n      Wind-play tossed their hair\n    Creeping things among the grass\n      Stroked them here and there;\n    Meggan piped a merry note\n      A fitful wayward lay\n    While shrill as bird on topmost twig\n      Piped merry May;\n    Honey-smooth the double flow.\n\n    Sped a herdsman from the vale\n      Mounting like a flame\n    All on fire to hear and see\n      With floating locks he came.\n    Looked neither north nor south\n      Neither east nor west\n    But sat him down at Meggan's feet\n      As love-bird on his nest\n    And wooed her with a silent awe\n      With trouble not expressed;\n    She sang the tears into his eyes\n      The heart out of his breast:\n    So he loved her listening so.\n\n    She sang the heart out of his breast\n      The words out of his tongue;\n    Hand and foot and pulse he paused\n      Till her song was sung.\n    Then he spoke up from his place\n      Simple words and true:\n    \"Scanty goods have I to give\n      Scanty skill to woo;\n    But I have a will to work\n      And a heart for you:\n    Bid me stay or bid me go.\"\n\n    Then Meggan mused within herself:\n      \"Better be first with him\n    Than dwell where fairer Margaret sits\n      Who shines my brightness dim\n    Forever second where she sits\n      However fair I be:\n    I will be lady of his love\n      And he shall worship me;\n    I will be lady of his herds\n      And stoop to his degree\n    At home where kids and fatlings grow.\"\n\n    Sped a shepherd from the height\n      Headlong down to look\n    (White lambs followed lured by love\n      Of their shepherd's crook):\n    He turned neither east nor west\n      Neither north nor south\n    But knelt right down to May for love\n      Of her sweet-singing mouth;\n    Forgot his flocks his panting flocks\n      In parching hillside drouth;\n    Forgot himself for weal or woe.\n\n    Trilled her song and swelled her song\n      With maiden coy caprice\n    In a labyrinth of throbs\n      Pauses cadences;\n    Clear-noted as a dropping brook\n      Soft-noted like the bees\n    Wild-noted as the shivering wind\n      Forlorn through forest trees:\n    Love-noted like the wood-pigeon\n      Who hides herself for love\n    Yet cannot keep her secret safe\n      But cooes and cooes thereof:\n    Thus the notes rang loud or low.\n\n    He hung breathless on her breath;\n      Speechless who listened well;\n    Could not speak or think or wish\n      Till silence broke the spell.\n    Then he spoke and spread his hands\n      Pointing here and there:\n    \"See my sheep and see the lambs\n      Twin lambs which they bare.\n    All myself I offer you\n      All my flocks and care\n    Your sweet song hath moved me so.\"\n\n    In her fluttered heart young May\n      Mused a dubious while:\n    \"If he loves me as he says\"--\n      Her lips curved with a smile:\n    \"Where Margaret shines like the sun\n      I shine but like a moon;\n    If sister Meggan makes her choice\n      I can make mine as soon;\n    At cockcrow we were sister-maids\n      We may be brides at noon.\"\n    Said Meggan \"Yes\"; May said not \"No.\"\n\n    Fair Margaret stayed alone at home\n      Awhile she sang her song\n    Awhile sat silent then she thought:\n      \"My sisters loiter long.\"\n    That sultry noon had waned away\n      Shadows had waxen great:\n    \"Surely\" she thought within herself\n      \"My sisters loiter late.\"\n    She rose and peered out at the door\n      With patient heart to wait\n    And heard a distant nightingale\n      Complaining of its mate;\n    Then down the garden slope she walked\n      Down to the garden gate\n    Leaned on the rail and waited so.\n\n    The slope was lightened by her eyes\n      Like summer lightning fair\n    Like rising of the haloed moon\n      Lightened her glimmering hair\n    While her face lightened like the sun\n      Whose dawn is rosy white.\n    Thus crowned with maiden majesty\n      She peered into the night\n    Looked up the hill and down the hill\n      To left hand and to right\n    Flashing like fire-flies to and fro.\n\n    Waiting thus in weariness\n      She marked the nightingale\n    Telling if any one would heed\n      Its old complaining tale.\n    Then lifted she her voice and sang\n      Answering the bird:\n    Then lifted she her voice and sang\n      Such notes were never heard\n    From any bird when Spring's in blow.\n\n    The king of all that country\n      Coursing far coursing near\n    Curbed his amber-bitted steed\n      Coursed amain to hear;\n    All his princes in his train\n      Squire and knight and peer\n    With his crown upon his head\n      His sceptre in his hand\n    Down he fell at Margaret's knees\n      Lord king of all that land\n    To her highness bending low.\n\n    Every beast and bird and fish\n      Came mustering to the sound\n    Every man and every maid\n      From miles of country round:\n    Meggan on her herdsman's arm\n      With her shepherd May\n    Flocks and herds trooped at their heels\n      Along the hillside way;\n    No foot too feeble for the ascent\n      Not any head too gray;\n    Some were swift and none were slow.\n\n    So Margaret sang her sisters home\n      In their marriage mirth;\n    Sang free birds out of the sky\n      Beasts along the earth\n    Sang up fishes of the deep--\n      All breathing things that move\n    Sang from far and sang from near\n      To her lovely love;\n    Sang together friend and foe;\n\n    Sang a golden-bearded king\n      Straightway to her feet\n    Sang him silent where he knelt\n      In eager anguish sweet.\n    But when the clear voice died away\n      When longest echoes died\n    He stood up like a royal man\n      And claimed her for his bride.\n    So three maids were wooed and won\n      In a brief May-tide\n    Long ago and long ago.", "JESSIE CAMERON": "    \"Jessie Jessie Cameron\n       Hear me but this once\" quoth he.\n    \"Good luck go with you neighbor's son\n      But I'm no mate for you\" quoth

the rose of keenest thorn!\n    One hidden summer morn\n    Under the rose I was born.\n\n    I do not guess his name\n    Who wrought my Mother's shame\n    And gave me life forlorn\n    But my Mother Mother Mother\n    I know her from all other.\n    My Mother pale and mild\n    Fair as ever was seen\n    She was but scarce sixteen\n    Little more than a child\n    When I was born\n    To work her scorn.\n    With secret bitter throes\n    In a passion of secret woes\n    She bore me under the rose.\n\n    One who my Mother nursed\n    Took me from the first:--\n    \"O nurse let me

guess\n    I know this not the less.\n\n    So I was sent away\n    That none might spy the truth:\n    And my childhood waxed to youth\n    And I left off childish play.\n    I never cared to play\n    With the village boys and girls;\n    And I think they thought me proud\n    I found so little to say\n    And kept so from the crowd:\n    But I had the longest curls\n    And I had the largest eyes\n    And my teeth were small like pearls;\n    The girls might flout and scout me\n    But the boys would hang about me\n    In sheepish mooning wise.\n\n    Our one-street village stood\n    A long mile from the town\n    A mile of windy down\n    And bleak one-sided wood\n    With not a single house.\n    Our town itself was small\n    With just the common shops\n    And throve in its small way.\n    Our neighboring gentry reared\n    The good old-fashioned crops\n    And made old-fashioned boasts\n    Of what John Bull would do\n    If Frenchman Frog appeared\n    And drank old-fashioned toasts\n    And made old-fashioned bows\n    To my Lady at the Hall.\n\n    My Lady at the Hall\n    Is grander than they all:\n    Hers is the oldest name\n    In all the neighborhood;\n    But the race must die with her\n    Though she's a lofty dame\n    For she's unmarried still.\n    Poor people say she's good\n    And has an open hand\n    As any in the land\n    And she's the comforter\n    Of many sick and sad;\n    My nurse once said to me\n    That everything she had\n    Came of my Lady's bounty:\n    \"Though she's greatest in the county\n    She's humble to the poor\n    No beggar seeks her door\n    But finds help presently.\n    I pray both night and day\n    For her and you must pray:\n    But she'll never feel distress\n    If needy folk can bless.\"\n    I was a little maid\n    When here we came to live\n    From somewhere by the sea.\n    Men spoke a foreign tongue\n    There where we used to be\n    When I was merry and young\n    Too young to feel afraid;\n    The fisher-folk would give\n    A kind strange word to me\n    There by the foreign sea:\n    I don't know where it was\n    But I remember still\n    Our cottage on a hill\n    And fields of flowering grass\n    On that fair foreign shore.\n\n    I liked my old home best\n    But this was pleasant too:\n    So here we made our nest\n    And here I grew.\n    And now and then my Lady\n    In riding past our door\n    Would nod to nurse and speak\n    Or stoop and pat my cheek;\n    And I was always ready\n    To hold the field-gate wide\n    For my Lady to go through;\n    My Lady in her veil\n    So seldom put aside\n    My Lady grave and pale.\n\n    I often sat to wonder\n    Who might my parents be\n    For I knew of something under\n    My simple-seeming state.\n    Nurse never talked to me\n    Of mother or of father\n    But watched me early and late\n    With kind suspicious cares:\n    Or not suspicious rather\n    Anxious as if she knew\n    Some secret I might gather\n    And smart for unawares.\n    Thus I grew.\n\n    But Nurse waxed old and gray\n    Bent and weak with years.\n    There came a certain day\n    That she lay upon her bed\n    Shaking her palsied head\n    With words she gasped to say\n    Which had to stay unsaid.\n    Then with a jerking hand\n    Held out so piteously\n    She gave a ring to me\n    Of gold wrought curiously\n    A ring which she had worn\n    Since the day that I was born\n    She once had said to me:\n    I slipped it on my finger;\n    Her eyes were keen to linger\n    On my hand that slipped it on;\n    Then she sighed one rattling sigh\n    And stared on with sightless eye:--\n    The one who loved me was gone.\n\n    How long I stayed alone\n    With the corpse I never knew\n    For I fainted dead as stone:\n    When I came to life once more\n    I was down upon the floor\n    With neighbors making ado\n    To bring me back to life.\n    I heard the sexton's wife\n    Say: \"Up my lad and run\n    To tell it at the Hall;\n    She was my Lady's nurse\n    And done can't be undone.\n    I'll watch by this poor lamb.\n    I guess my Lady's purse\n    Is always open to such:\n    I'd run up on my crutch\n    A cripple as I am\"\n    (For cramps had vexed her much)\n    \"Rather than this dear heart\n    Lack one to take her part.\"\n\n    For days day after day\n    On my weary bed I lay\n    Wishing the time would pass;\n    O so wishing that I was\n    Likely to pass away:\n    For the one friend whom I knew\n    Was dead I knew no other\n    Neither father nor mother;\n    And I what should I do?\n\n    One day the sexton's wife\n    Said: \"Rouse yourself my dear:\n    My Lady has driven down\n    From the Hall into the town\n    And we think she's coming here.\n    Cheer up for life is life.\"\n\n    But I would not look or speak\n    Would not cheer up at all.\n    My tears were like to fall\n    So I turned round to the wall\n    And hid my hollow cheek\n    Making as if I slept\n    As silent as a stone\n    And no one knew I wept.\n    What was my Lady to me\n    The grand lady from the Hall?\n    She might come or stay away\n    I was sick at heart that day:\n    The whole world seemed to be\n    Nothing just nothing to me\n    For aught that I could see.\n\n    Yet I listened where I lay:\n    A bustle came below\n    A clear voice said: \"I know;\n    I will see her first alone\n    It may be less of a shock\n    If she's so weak to-day\":--\n    A light hand turned the lock\n    A light step crossed the floor\n    One sat beside my bed:\n    But never a word she said.\n\n    For me my shyness grew\n    Each moment more and more:\n    So I said never a word\n    And neither looked nor stirred;\n    I think she must have heard\n    My heart go pit-a-pat:\n    Thus I lay my Lady sat\n    More than a mortal hour\n    (I counted one and two\n    By the house-clock while I lay):\n    I seemed to have no power\n    To think of a thing to say\n    Or do what I ought to do\n    Or rouse myself to a choice.\n\n    At last she said: \"Margaret\n    Won't you even look at me?\"\n    A something in her voice\n    Forced my tears to fall at last\n    Forced sobs from me thick and fast;\n    Something not of the past\n    Yet stirring memory;\n    A something new and yet\n    Not new too sweet to last\n    Which I never can forget.\n\n    I turned and stared at her:\n    Her cheek showed hollow-pale;\n    Her hair like mine was fair\n    A wonderful fall of hair\n    That screened her like a veil;\n    But her height was statelier\n    Her eyes had depth more deep:\n    I think they must have had\n    Always a something sad\n    Unless they were asleep.\n\n    While I stared my Lady took\n    My hand in her spare hand\n    Jewelled and soft and grand\n    And looked with a long long look\n    Of hunger in my face;\n    As if she tried to trace\n    Features she ought to know\n    And half hoped half feared to find.\n    Whatever was in her mind\n    She heaved a sigh at last\n    And began to talk to me.\n    \"Your nurse was my dear nurse\n    And her nursling's dear\" said she:\n    \"No one told me a word\n    Of her getting worse and worse\n    Till her poor life was past\"\n    (Here my Lady's tears dropped fast):\n    \"I might have been with her\n    I might have promised and heard\n    But she had no comforter.\n    She might have told me much\n    Which now I shall never know\n    Never never shall know.\"\n    She sat by me sobbing so\n    And seemed so woe-begone\n    That I laid one hand upon\n    Hers with a timid touch\n    Scarce thinking what I did\n    Not knowing what to say:\n    That moment her face was hid\n    In the pillow close by mine\n    Her arm was flung over me\n    She hugged me sobbing so\n    As if her heart would break\n    And kissed me where I lay.\n\n    After this she often came\n    To bring me fruit or wine\n    Or sometimes hothouse flowers.\n    And at nights I lay awake\n    Often and often thinking\n    What to do for her sake.\n    Wet or dry it was the same:\n    She would come in at all hours\n    Set me eating and drinking\n    And say I must grow strong;\n    At last the day seemed long\n    And home seemed scarcely home\n    If she did not come.\n\n    Well I grew strong again:\n    In time of primroses\n    I went to pluck them in the lane;\n    In time of nestling birds\n    I heard them chirping round the house;\n    And all the herds\n    Were out at grass when I grew strong\n    And days were waxen long\n    And there was work for bees\n    Among the May-bush boughs\n    And I had shot up tall\n    And life felt after all\n    Pleasant and not so long\n    When I grew strong.\n\n    I was going to the Hall\n    To be my Lady's maid:\n    \"Her little friend\" she said to me\n    \"Almost her child\"\n    She said and smiled\n    Sighing painfully;\n    Blushing with a second flush\n    As if she blushed to blush.\n\n    Friend servant child: just this\n    My standing at the Hall;\n    The other servants call me \"Miss\"\n    My Lady calls me \"Margaret\"\n    With her clear voice musical.\n    She never chides when I forget\n    This or that; she never chides.\n    Except when people come to stay\n    (And that's not often) at the Hall\n    I sit with her all day\n    And ride out when she rides.\n    She sings to me and makes me sing;\n    Sometimes I read to her\n    Sometimes we merely sit and talk.\n    She noticed once my ring\n    And made me tell its history:\n    That evening in our garden walk\n    She said she should infer\n    The ring had been my father's first\n    Then my mother's given for me\n    To the nurse who nursed\n    My mother in her misery\n    That so quite certainly\n    Some one might know me who--\n    Then she was silent and I too.\n\n    I hate when people come:\n    The women speak and stare\n    And mean to be so civil.\n    This one will stroke my hair\n    That one will pat my cheek\n    And praise my Lady's kindness\n    Expecting me to speak;\n    I like the proud ones best\n    Who sit as struck with blindness\n    As if I wasn't there.\n    But if any gentleman\n    Is staying at the Hall\n    (Though few come prying here)\n    My Lady seems to fear\n    Some downright dreadful evil\n    And makes me keep my room\n    As closely as she can:\n    So I hate when people come\n    It is so troublesome.\n    In spite of all her care\n    Sometimes to keep alive\n    I sometimes do contrive\n    To get out in the grounds\n    For a whiff of wholesome air\n    Under the rose you know:\n    It's charming to break bounds\n    Stolen waters are sweet\n    And what's the good of feet\n    If for days they mustn't go?\n    Give me a longer tether\n    Or I may break from it.\n\n    Now I have eyes and ears\n    And just some little wit:\n    \"Almost my lady's child\";\n    I recollect she smiled\n    Sighed and blushed together;\n    Then her story of the ring\n    Sounds not improbable\n    She told it me so well\n    It seemed the actual thing:--\n    O keep your counsel close\n    But I guess under the rose\n    In long past summer weather\n    When the world was blossoming\n    And the rose upon its thorn:\n    I guess not who he was\n    Flawed honor like a glass\n    And made my life forlorn;\n    But my Mother Mother Mother\n    O I know her from all other.\n\n    My Lady you might trust\n    Your daughter with your fame.\n    Trust me I would not shame\n    Our honorable name\n    For I have noble blood\n    Though I was bred in dust\n    And brought up in the mud.\n    I will not press my claim\n    Just leave me where you will:\n    But you might trust your daughter\n    For blood is thicker than water\n    And you're my mother still.\n\n    So my Lady holds her own\n    With condescending grace\n    And fills her lofty place\n    With an untroubled face\n    As a queen may fill a throne.\n    While I could hint a tale\n    (But then I am her child)\n    Would make her quail;\n    Would set her in the dust\n    Lorn with no comforter\n    Her glorious hair defiled\n    And ashes on her cheek:\n    The decent world would thrust\n    Its finger out at her\n    Not much displeased I think\n    To make a nine days' stir;\n    The decent world would sink\n    Its voice to speak of her.\n\n    Now this is what I mean\n    To do no more no less:\n    Never to speak or show\n    Bare sign of what I know.\n    Let the blot pass unseen;\n    Yea let her never guess\n    I hold the tangled clew\n    She huddles out of view.\n    Friend servant almost child\n    So be it and nothing more\n    On this side of the grave.\n    Mother in Paradise\n    You'll see with clearer eyes;\n    Perhaps in this world even\n    When you are like to die\n    And face to face with Heaven\n    You'll drop for once the lie:\n    But you must drop the mask not I.\n\n    My Lady promises\n    Two hundred pounds with me\n    Whenever I may wed\n    A man she can approve:\n    And since besides her bounty\n    I'm fairest in the county\n    (For so I've heard it said\n    Though I don't vouch for this)\n    Her promised pounds may move\n    Some honest man to see\n    My virtues and my beauties;\n    Perhaps the rising grazier\n    Or temperance publican\n    May claim my wifely duties.\n    Meanwhile I wait their leisure\n    And grace-bestowing pleasure\n    I wait the happy man;\n    But if I hold my head\n    And pitch my expectations\n    Just higher than their level\n    They must fall back on patience:\n    I may not mean to wed\n    Yet I'll be civil.\n\n    Now sometimes in a dream\n    My heart goes out of me\n    To build and scheme\n    Till I sob after things that seem\n    So pleasant in a dream:\n    A home such as I see\n    My blessed neighbors live in\n    With father and with mother\n    All proud of one another\n    Named by one common name\n    From baby in the bud\n    To full-blown workman father;\n    It's little short of Heaven.\n    I'd give my gentle blood\n    To wash my special shame\n    And drown my private grudge;\n    I'd toil and moil much rather\n    The dingiest cottage drudge\n    Whose mother need not blush\n    Than live here like a lady\n    And see my Mother flush\n    And hear her voice unsteady\n    Sometimes yet never dare\n    Ask to share her care.\n\n    Of course the servants sneer\n    Behind my back at me;\n    Of course the village girls\n    Who envy me my curls\n    And gowns and idleness\n    Take comfort in a jeer;\n    Of course the ladies guess\n    Just so much of my history\n    As points the emphatic stress\n    With which they laud my Lady;\n    The gentlemen who catch\n    A casual glimpse of me\n    And turn again to see\n    Their valets on the watch\n    To speak a word with me\n    All know and sting me wild;\n    Till I am almost ready\n    To wish that I were dead\n    No faces more to see\n    No more words to be said\n    My Mother safe at last\n    Disburdened of her child\n    And the past past.\n\n    \"All equal before God\"--\n    Our Rector has it so\n    And sundry sleepers nod:\n    It may be so; I know\n    All are not equal here\n    And when the sleepers wake\n    They make a difference.\n    \"All equal in the grave\"--\n    That shows an obvious sense:\n    Yet something which I crave\n    Not death itself brings near;\n    How should death half atone\n    For all my past; or make\n    The name I bear my own?\n\n    I love my dear old Nurse\n    Who loved me without gains;\n    I love my mistress even\n    Friend Mother what you will:\n    But I could almost curse\n    My Father for his pains;\n    And sometimes at my prayer\n    Kneeling in sight of Heaven\n    I almost curse him still:\n    Why did he set his snare\n    To catch at unaware\n    My Mother's foolish youth;\n    Load me with shame that's hers\n    And her with something worse\n    A lifelong lie for truth?\n\n    I think my mind is fixed\n    On one point and made up:\n    To accept my lot unmixed;\n    Never to drug the cup\n    But drink it by myself.\n    I'll not be wooed for pelf;\n    I'll not blot out my shame\n    With any man's good name;\n    But nameless as I stand\n    My hand is my own hand\n    And nameless as I came\n    I go to the dark land.\n\n    \"All equal in the grave\"--\n    I bide my time till then:\n    \"All equal before God\"--\n    To-day I feel His rod\n    To-morrow He may save:\n                Amen.",

wire\n    But sackcloth were the sails of the least;\n    And all the crews made music and two had spread a feast.\n\n    The first choir breathed in flutes\n    And fingered soft guitars;\n    The second won from lutes\n    Harmonious chords and jars\n    With drums for stormy bars:\n    But the third was all of harpers and scarlet trumpeters;\n    Notes of triumph then\n    An alarm again\n    As for onset as for victory rallies stirs\n    Peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.\n\n    The first barge showed for figurehead a Love with wings;\n    The second showed for figurehead a Worm with stings;\n    The third a Lily tangled to a Rose which clings.\n    The first bore for freight gold and spice and down;\n    The second bore a sword a sceptre and a crown;\n    The third a heap of earth gone to dust and brown.\n    Winged Love meseemed like Folly in the face;\n    Stinged Worm meseemed loathly in his place;\n    Lily and Rose were flowers of grace.\n\n    Merry went the revel of the fire-sailed crew\n    Singing feasting dancing to and fro:\n    Pleasures ever changing ever graceful ever new;\n    Sighs but scarce of woe;\n    All the sighing\n    Wooed such sweet replying;\n    All the sighing sweet and low\n    Used to come and go\n    For more pleasure merely so.\n    Yet at intervals some one grew tired\n    Of everything desired\n    And sank I knew not whither in sorry plight\n    Out of sight.\n\n    The second crew seemed ever\n    Wider-visioned graver\n    More distinct of purpose more sustained of will;\n    With heads erect and proud\n    And voices sometimes loud;\n    With endless tacking counter-tacking\n    All things grasping all things lacking\n    It would seem;\n    Ever shifting helm or sail or shroud\n    Drifting on as in a dream.\n    Hoarding to their utmost bent\n    Feasting to their fill\n    Yet gnawed by discontent\n    Envy hatred malice on their road they went.\n    Their freight was not a treasure\n    Their music not a pleasure;\n    The sword flashed cleaving through their bands\n    Sceptre and crown changed hands.\n\n    The third crew as they went\n    Seemed mostly different;\n    They toiled in rowing for to them the wind was contrary\n    As all the world might see.\n    They labored at the oar\n    While on their heads they bore\n    The fiery stress of sunshine more and more.\n    They labored at the oar hand-sore\n    Till rain went splashing\n    And spray went dashing\n    Down on them and up on them more and more.\n    Their sails were patched and rent\n    Their masts were bent\n    In peril of their lives they worked and went.\n    For them no feast was spread\n    No soft luxurious bed\n    Scented and white\n    No crown or sceptre hung in sight;\n    In weariness and painfulness\n    In thirst and sore distress\n    They rowed and steered from left to right\n    With all their might.\n    Their trumpeters and harpers round about\n    Incessantly played out\n    And sometimes they made answer with a shout;\n    But oftener they groaned or wept\n    And seldom paused to eat and seldom slept.\n    I wept for pity watching them but more\n    I wept heart-sore\n    Once and again to see\n    Some weary man plunge overboard and swim\n    To Love or Worm ship floating buoyantly:\n    And there all welcomed him.\n\n    The ships steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other\n    Yet all the crews were interchangeable;\n    Now one man now another\n    --Like bloodless spectres some some flushed by health--\n    Changed openly or changed by stealth\n    Scaling a slippery side and scaled it well.\n    The most left Love ship hauling wealth\n    Up Worm ship's side;\n    While some few hollow-eyed\n    Left either for the sack-sailed boat;\n    But this though not remote\n    Was worst to mount and whoso left it once\n    Scarce ever came again\n    But seemed to loathe his erst companions\n    And wish and work them bane.\n\n    Then I knew (I know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread\n    Rocks and reefs and whirlpools in the water-bed\n    Whence a waterspout\n    Instantaneously leaped out\n    Roaring as it reared its head.\n\n    Soon I spied a something dim\n    Many-handed grim\n    That went flitting to and fro the first and second ship;\n    It puffed their sails full out\n    With puffs of smoky breath\n    From a smouldering lip\n    And cleared the waterspout\n    Which reeled roaring round about\n    Threatening death.\n    With a horny hand it steered\n    And a horn appeared\n    On its sneering head upreared\n    Haughty and high\n    Against the blackening lowering sky.\n    With a hoof it swayed the waves;\n    They opened here and there\n    Till I spied deep ocean graves\n    Full of skeletons\n    That were men and women once\n    Foul or fair;\n    Full of things that creep\n    And fester in the deep\n    And never breathe the clean life-nurturing air.\n\n    The third bark held aloof\n    From the Monster with the hoof\n    Despite his urgent beck\n    And fraught with guile\n    Abominable his smile;\n    Till I saw him take a flying leap on to that deck.\n    Then full of awe\n    With these same eyes I saw\n    His head incredible retract its horn\n    Rounding like babe's new born\n    While silvery phosphorescence played\n    About his dis-horned head.\n    The sneer smoothed from his lip\n    He beamed blandly on the ship;\n    All winds sank to a moan\n    All waves to a monotone\n    (For all these seemed his realm)\n    While he laid a strong caressing hand upon the helm.\n\n    Then a cry well nigh of despair\n    Shrieked to heaven a clamor of desperate prayer.\n    The harpers harped no more\n    While the trumpeters sounded sore\n    An alarm to wake the dead from their bed:\n    To the rescue to the rescue now or never\n    To the rescue O ye living O ye dead\n    Or no more help or hope for ever!--\n    The planks strained as though they must part asunder\n    The masts bent as though they must dip under\n    And the winds and the waves at length\n    Girt up their strength\n    And the depths were laid bare\n    And heaven flashed fire and volleyed thunder\n    Through the rain-choked air\n    And sea and sky seemed to kiss\n    In the horror and the hiss\n    Of the whole world shuddering everywhere.\n\n    Lo! a Flyer swooping down\n    With wings to span the globe\n    And splendor for his robe\n    And splendor for his crown.\n    He lighted on the helm with a foot of fire\n    And spun the Monster overboard:\n    And that monstrous thing abhorred\n    Gnashing with balked desire\n    Wriggled like a worm infirm\n    Up the Worm\n    Of the loathly figurehead.\n    There he crouched and gnashed;\n    And his head re-horned and gashed\n    From the other's grapple dripped bloody red.\n\n    I saw that thing accurst\n    Wreak his worst\n    On the first and second crew:\n    Some with baited hook\n    He angled for and took\n    Some dragged overboard in a net he threw\n    Some he did to death\n    With hoof or horn or blasting breath.\n\n    I heard a voice of wailing\n    Where the ships went sailing\n    A sorrowful voice prevailing\n    Above the sound of the sea\n    Above the singers' voices\n    And musical merry noises;\n    All songs had turned to sighing\n    The light was failing\n    The day was dying--\n    Ah me\n    That such a sorrow should be!\n\n    There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land\n    When Love ship went down by the bottomless quicksand\n    To its grave in the bitter wave.\n    There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land\n    When Worm ship went to pieces on the rock-bound strand\n    And the bitter wave was its grave.\n    But land and sea waxed hoary\n    In whiteness of a glory\n    Never told in story\n    Nor seen by mortal eye\n    When the third ship crossed the bar\n    Where whirls and breakers are\n    And steered into the splendors of the sky;\n    That third bark and that least\n    Which had never seemed to feast\n    Yet kept high festival above sun and moon and star.", "YET A LITTLE WHILE": "    I dreamed and did not seek: to-day I seek\n        Who can no longer dream;\n    But now am all behindhand waxen weak\n      And dazed amid so many things that gleam\n        Yet are not what

Johnny had a golden head\n      Like a golden mop in blow\n    Right and left his curls would spread\n      In a glory and a glow\n    And they framed his honest face\n    Like stray sunbeams out of place.\n\n    Long and thick they half could hide\n      How threadbare his patched jacket hung;\n    They used to be his Mother's pride;\n      She praised them with a tender tongue\n    And stroked them with a loving finger\n    That smoothed and stroked and loved to linger.\n\n    On a doorstep Johnny sat\n      Up and down the street looked he;\n    Johnny did not own a hat\n      Hot or cold tho' days might be;\n    Johnny did not own a boot\n    To cover up his muddy foot.\n\n    Johnny's face was pale and thin\n      Pale with hunger and with crying;\n    For his Mother lay within\n      Talked and tossed and seemed a-dying\n    While Johnny racked his brains to think\n    How to get her help and drink\n\n    Get her physic get her tea\n      Get her bread and something nice;\n    Not a penny piece had he\n      And scarce a shilling might suffice;\n    No wonder that his soul was sad\n    When not one penny piece he had.\n\n    As he sat there thinking moping\n      Because his Mother's wants were many\n    Wishing much but scarcely hoping\n      To earn a shilling or a penny\n    A friendly neighbor passed him by\n    And questioned him: Why did he cry?\n\n    Alas! his trouble soon was told:\n      He did not cry for cold or hunger\n    Though he was hungry both and cold;\n      He only felt more weak and younger\n    Because he wished so to be old\n    And apt at earning pence or gold.\n\n    Kindly that neighbor was but poor\n      Scant coin had he to give or lend;\n    And well he guessed there needed more\n      Than pence or shillings to befriend\n    The helpless woman in her strait\n    So much loved yet so desolate.\n\n    One way he saw and only one:\n      He would--he could not--give the advice\n    And yet he must: the widow's son\n      Had curls of gold would fetch their price;\n    Long curls which might be clipped and sold\n    For silver or perhaps for gold.\n\n    Our Johnny when he understood\n      Which shop it was that purchased hair\n    Ran off as briskly as he could\n      And in a trice stood cropped and bare\n    Too short of hair to fill a locket\n    But jingling money in his pocket.\n\n    Precious money--tea and bread\n      Physic ease for Mother dear\n    Better than a golden head:\n      Yet our hero dropped one tear\n    When he spied himself close shorn\n    Barer much than lamb new born.\n\n    His Mother throve upon the money\n      Ate and revived and kissed her son:\n    But oh! when she perceived her Johnny\n      And understood what he had done\n    All and only for her sake\n    She sobbed as if her heart must break.\n\n\n\n    \"HOLLOW-SOUNDING AND MYSTERIOUS.\"\n\n\n    There's no replying\n    To the Wind's sighing\n    Telling foretelling\n    Dying undying\n    Dwindling and

(for I know not which)\n      I was or was not mazed within a wood\n      Where every mother-bird brought up her brood\n        Safe in some leafy niche\n    Of oak or ash of cypress or of beech\n\n    Of silvery aspen trembling delicately\n      Of plane or warmer-tinted sycamore\n      Of elm that dies in secret from the core\n        Of ivy weak and free\n    Of pines of all green lofty things that be.\n\n    Such birds they seemed as challenged each desire;\n      Like spots of azure heaven upon the wing\n      Like downy emeralds that alight and sing\n        Like actual coals on fire\n      Like anything they seemed and everything.\n\n    Such mirth they made such warblings and such chat\n      With tongue of music in a well-tuned beak\n      They seemed to speak more wisdom than we speak\n        To make our music flat\n      And all our subtlest reasonings wild or weak.\n\n    Their meat was nought but flowers like butterflies\n      With berries coral-colored or like gold;\n      Their drink was only dew which blossoms hold\n        Deep where the honey lies;\n    Their wings and tails were lit by sparkling eyes.\n\n    The shade wherein they revelled was a shade\n      That danced and twinkled to the unseen sun;\n      Branches and leaves cast shadows one by one\n        And all their shadows swayed\n    In breaths of air that rustled and that played.\n\n    A sound of waters neither rose nor sank\n      And spread a sense of freshness through the air;\n      It seemed not here or there but everywhere\n        As if the whole earth drank\n    Root fathom deep and strawberry on its bank.\n\n    But I who saw such things as I have said\n      Was overdone with utter weariness;\n      And walked in care as one whom fears oppress\n        Because above his head\n    Death hangs or damage or the dearth of bread.\n\n    Each sore defeat of my defeated life\n      Faced and outfaced me in that bitter hour;\n      And turned to yearning palsy all my power\n        And all my peace to strife\n    Self stabbing self with keen lack-pity knife.\n\n    Sweetness of beauty moved me to despair\n      Stung me to anger by its mere content\n      Made me all lonely on that way I went\n        Piled care upon my care\n    Brimmed full my cup and stripped me empty and bare:\n\n    For all that was but showed what all was not\n      But gave clear proof of what might never be;\n      Making more destitute my poverty\n        And yet more blank my lot\n      And me much sadder by its jubilee.\n\n    Therefore I sat me down: for wherefore walk?\n      And closed mine eyes: for wherefore see or hear?\n      Alas I had no shutter to mine ear\n        And could not shun the talk\n      Of all rejoicing creatures far or near.\n\n    Without my will I hearkened and I heard\n      (Asleep or waking for I know not which)\n      Till note by note the music changed its pitch;\n        Bird ceased to answer bird\n    And every wind sighed softly if it stirred.\n\n    The drip of widening waters seemed to weep\n      All fountains sobbed and gurgled as they sprang\n    Somewhere a cataract cried out in its leap\n        Sheer down a headlong steep;\n      High over all cloud-thunders gave a clang.\n\n    Such universal sound of lamentation\n      I heard and felt fain not to feel or hear;\n      Nought else there seemed but anguish far and near;\n        Nought else but all creation\n      Moaning and groaning wrung by pain or fear\n\n    Shuddering in the misery of its doom:\n      My heart then rose a rebel against light\n      Scouring all earth and heaven and depth and height\n        Ingathering wrath and gloom\n      Ingathering wrath to wrath and night to night.\n\n    Ah me the bitterness of such revolt\n      All impotent all hateful and all hate\n    That kicks and breaks itself against the bolt\n        Of an imprisoning fate\n      And vainly shakes and cannot shake the gate.\n\n    Agony to agony deep called to deep\n      Out of the deep I called of my desire;\n      My strength was weakness and my heart was fire;\n        Mine eyes that would not weep\n    Or sleep scaled height and depth and could not sleep;\n\n    The eyes I mean of my rebellious soul\n      For still my bodily eyes were closed and dark:\n      A random thing I seemed without a mark\n        Racing without a goal\n      Adrift upon life's sea without an ark.\n\n    More leaden than the actual self of lead\n      Outer and inner darkness weighed on me.\n      The tide of anger ebbed. Then fierce and free\n        Surged full above my head\n      The moaning tide of helpless misery.\n\n    Why should I breathe whose breath was but a sigh?\n      Why should I live who drew such painful breath?\n    Oh weary work the unanswerable why!--\n        Yet I why should I die\n      Who had no hope in life no hope in death?\n\n    Grasses and mosses and the fallen leaf\n      Make peaceful bed for an indefinite term;\n      But underneath the grass there gnaws a worm--\n        Haply there gnaws a grief--\n    Both haply always; not as now so brief.\n\n    The pleasure I remember it is past;\n      The pain I feel is passing passing by;\n      Thus all the world is passing and thus I:\n        All things that cannot last\n      Have grown familiar and are born to die.\n\n    And being familiar have so long been borne\n      That habit trains us not to break but bend:\n    Mourning grows natural to us who mourn\n        In foresight of an end\n      But that which ends not who shall brave or mend?\n\n    Surely the ripe fruits tremble on their bough\n      They cling and linger trembling till they drop:\n    I trembling cling to dying life; for how\n        Face the perpetual Now?\n      Birthless and deathless void of start or stop\n\n    Void of repentance void of hope and fear\n      Of possibility alternative\n      Of all that ever made us bear to live\n        From night to morning here\n      Of promise even which has no gift to give.\n\n    The wood and every creature of the wood\n      Seemed mourning with me in an undertone;\n      Soft scattered chirpings and a windy moan\n        Trees rustling where they stood\n    And shivered showed compassion for my mood.\n\n    Rage to despair; and now despair had turned\n      Back to self-pity and mere weariness\n    With yearnings like a smouldering fire that burned\n        And might grow more or less\n      And might die out or wax to white excess.\n\n    Without within me music seemed to be;\n      Something not music yet most musical\n    Silence and sound in heavenly harmony;\n        At length a pattering fall\n    Of feet a bell and bleatings broke through all.\n\n    Then I looked up. The wood lay in a glow\n      From golden sunset and from ruddy sky;\n      The sun had stooped to earth though once so high;\n        Had stooped to earth in slow\n    Warm dying loveliness brought near and low.\n\n    Each water-drop made answer to the light\n      Lit up a spark and showed the sun his face;\n      Soft purple shadows paved the grassy space\n        And crept from height to height\n      From height to loftier height crept up apace.\n\n    While opposite the sun a gazing moon\n      Put on his glory for her coronet\n    Kindling her luminous coldness to its noon\n        As his great splendor set;\n      One only star made up her train as yet.\n\n    Each twig was tipped with gold each leaf was edged\n      And veined with gold from the gold-flooded west;\n    Each mother-bird and mate-bird and unfledged\n        Nestling and curious nest\n      Displayed a gilded moss or beak or breast.\n\n    And filing peacefully between the trees\n      Having the moon behind them and the sun\n    Full in their meek mild faces walked at ease\n        A homeward flock at peace\n      With one another and with every one.\n\n    A patriarchal ram with tinkling bell\n      Led all his kin; sometimes one browsing sheep\n      Hung back a moment or one lamb would leap\n        And frolic in a dell;\n    Yet still they kept together journeying well\n\n    And bleating one or other many or few\n      Journeying together toward the sunlit west;\n      Mild face by face and woolly breast by breast\n        Patient sun-brightened too\n      Still journeying toward the sunset and their rest.\n\n\n\n    \"ALL THY WORKS PRAISE THEE O LORD.\"", "A PROCESSIONAL OF CREATION": "      All.\n\n    I All-Creation sing my song of praise\n    To God Who made me and vouchsafes

sift the air and winnow all the earth;\n    And God Who poised our weights and weighs our worth\n    Accepts the worship of our solemn mirth.\n\n\n      Fire.\n\n    My power and strength are His Who

whiteness shadoweth Him Who is most fair\n    All spotless: yea my whiteness which I wear\n    Exalts His Purity beyond compare.\n\n\n      Vapors.\n\n    We darken sun and moon and blot the day\n    The good Will of our Maker to obey:\n    Till to the glory of God we pass away.\n\n\n      Night.\n\n    Moon and all stars I don for diadem\n    To make me fair: I cast myself and them\n    Before

 Sweet is our store exhaled from sea or river:\n    We wear a rainbow praising God the Giver\n    Because His mercy is for ever and ever.\n\n\n      Earth.\n\n    I rest in Him rejoicing: resting so\n    And so rejoicing in that I am low;\n    Yet known of Him and following on to know.\n\n\n      Mountains.\n\n    Our heights which laud Him sink abased before\n    Him higher than the highest evermore:\n    God higher than the highest we adore.\n\n\n      Hills.\n\n    We green-tops praise Him and we fruitful heads\n    Whereon the sunshine and the dew He sheds:\n    We green-tops praise Him rising from out beds.\n\n\n      Green Things.\n\n    We all green things we blossoms bright or dim\n    Trees bushes brushwood corn and grasses slim\n    We lift our many-favored lauds to Him.\n\n\n      Rose--Lily--Violet.\n\n    I praise Him on my thorn which I adorn--\n    And I amid my world of thistle and thorn--\n    And I within my veil where I am born.\n\n\n      Apple--Citron--Pomegranate.\n\n    We Apple-blossom Citron Pomegranate\n    We clothed of God without our toil and fret\n    We offer fatness where His Throne is set.\n\n\n      Vine--Cedar--Palm.\n\n    I proffer Him my sweetness who am sweet--\n    I bow my strength in fragrance at His feet--\n    I wave myself before His Judgment Seat.\n\n\n      Medicinal Herbs.\n\n    I bring refreshment--\n                          I bring ease and calm--\n    I lavish strength and healing--\n                                    I am balm--\n    We work His pitiful Will and chant our psalm.\n\n\n      A Spring.\n\n    Clear my pure fountain clear and pure my rill\n    My fountain and mine outflow deep and still\n    I set His semblance forth and do His Will.\n\n\n      Sea.\n\n    To-day I praise God

deep and grave.\n\n\n      Small Animals.\n\n    God forms us weak and small but pours out all\n    We need and notes us while we stand or fall:\n    Wherefore we praise Him weak and safe and small.\n\n\n      Lamb.\n\n    I praise my loving Lord Who maketh me\n    His type by harmless sweet simplicity:\n    Yet He the Lamb of lambs incomparably.\n\n\n      Lion.\n\n    I praise the Lion of the Royal Race\n    Strongest in fight and swiftest in the chase:\n    With all my might I leap and lavish praise.\n\n\n      All Men.\n\n    All creatures sing around us and we sing:\n    We bring

Holy and Humble Persons.\n\n    All humble souls he calls and sanctifies;\n    All holy souls He calls to make them wise;\n    Accepting all His free-will sacrifice.\n\n\n      Babes.\n\n    He maketh me--\n                    And me--\n                              And me--\n                                      To be\n    His blessed little ones around His knee\n    Who praise Him by mere love confidingly.\n\n\n      Women.\n\n    God makes our service love and makes our wage\n    Love: so we wend on patient pilgrimage\n    Extolling Him by love from age to age.\n\n\n      Men.\n\n    God gives us power to rule: He gives us power\n    To rule ourselves and prune the exuberant flower\n    Of youth and worship Him hour after hour.\n\n\n      Spirits and Souls--\n\n    Lo in the hidden world we chant our chant\n    To Him Who fills us that we nothing want\n    To Him Whose bounty leaves our craving scant.\n\n\n      of Babes--\n\n    With milky mouths we praise God from the breast\n    Called home betimes to rest the perfect rest\n    By love and joy fufilling His behest.\n\n\n      of Women--\n\n    We praise His Will which made us what He would\n    His Will which fashioned us and called us good\n    His Will our plenary beatitude.\n\n      of Men.\n\n    We praise His Will Who bore with us so long\n    Who out of weakness wrought us swift and strong\n    Champions of right and putters-down of wrong.\n\n\n      All.\n\n    Let everything that hath or hath not breath\n    Let days and endless days let life and death\n    Praise God praise God praise God His creature saith.", "LATER LIFE": "    1.\n\n    Before the mountains were brought forth before\n      Earth and the world were made then God was God:\n    And God will still be God when flames shall roar\n      Round earth and heaven dissolving at His nod:\n      And this God is our God even while His rod\n    Of righteous wrath falls on us smiting sore:\n    And this God is our God for evermore\n      Through life through death while clod returns to clod.\n    For though He slay us we will trust in Him;\n      We will flock home to Him by divers ways:\n      Yea though He slay us we will vaunt His praise\n    Serving and loving with the Cherubim\n    Watching and loving with the Seraphim\n      Our very selves His praise through endless days.\n\n\n    2.\n\n    Rend hearts and rend not garments for our sins;\n      Gird sackcloth not on body but on soul;\n      Grovel in dust with faces toward the goal\n    Nor won nor neared: he only laughs who wins.\n    Not neared the goal the race too late begins;\n      Or left undone we have yet to do the whole;\n      The sun is hurrying west and toward the pole\n    Where darkness waits for earth with all her kins.\n    Let us to-day while it is called to-day\n      Set out if utmost speed may yet avail--\n      The shadows lengthen and the light grows pale:\n        For who through darkness and the shadow of death\n    Darkness that may be felt shall find a way\n        Blind-eyed deaf-eared and choked with failing breath?\n\n\n    3.\n\n    Thou Who didst make and knowest whereof we are made\n      Oh bear in mind our dust and nothingness\n      Our wordless tearless dumbness of distress:\n    Bear Thou in mind the burden Thou hast laid\n    Upon us and our feebleness unstayed\n      Except Thou stay us: for the long long race\n      Which stretches far and far before our face\n    Thou knowest--remember Thou whereof we are made.\n    If making makes us Thine then Thine we are;\n      And if redemption we are twice Thine own:\n    If once Thou didst come down from heaven afar\n      To seek us and to find us how not save?\n    Comfort us save us leave us not alone\n      Thou Who didst die our death and fill our grave.\n\n\n    4.\n\n    So tired am I so weary of to-day\n      So unrefreshed from foregone weariness\n      So overburdened by foreseen distress\n    So lagging and so stumbling on my way\n    I scarce can rouse myself to watch or pray\n      To hope or aim or toil for more or less--\n      Ah always less and less even while I press\n    Forward and toil and aim as best I may.\n    Half-starved of soul and heartsick utterly\n      Yet lift I up my heart and soul and eyes\n      (Which fail in looking upward) toward the prize:\n    Me Lord Thou seest though I see not Thee;\n      Me now as once the Thief in Paradise\n    Even me O Lord my Lord remember me.\n\n\n    5.\n\n    Lord Thou Thyself art Love and only Thou;\n      Yet I who am not love would fain love Thee;\n      But Thou alone being Love canst furnish me\n    With that same love my heart is craving now.\n    Allow my plea! for if Thou disallow\n      No second fountain can I find but Thee;\n      No second hope or help is left to me\n    No second anything but only Thou.\n    O Love accept according my request;\n      O Love exhaust fulfilling my desire:\n      Uphold me with the strength that cannot tire\n    Nerve me to labor till Thou bid me rest\n      Kindle my fire from Thine unkindled fire\n    And charm the willing heart from out my breast.\n\n\n    6.\n\n    We lack yet cannot fix upon the lack:\n      Not this nor that; yet somewhat certainly.\n      We see the things we do not yearn to see\n    Around us: and what see we glancing back?\n    Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack\n      Hopes that were never ours yet seemed to be\n      For which we steered on life's salt stormy sea\n    Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.\n    If thus to look behind is all in vain\n      And all in vain to look to left or right\n    Why face we not our future once again\n    Launching with hardier hearts across the main\n      Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight\n    And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain?\n\n\n    7.\n\n    To love and to remember; that is good:\n      To love and to forget; that is not well:\n      To lapse from love to hatred; that is hell\n    And death and torment rightly understood.\n    Soul dazed by love and sorrow cheer thy mood;\n      More blest art thou than mortal tongue can tell:\n      Ring not thy funeral but thy marriage bell\n    And salt with hope thy life's insipid food.\n    Love is the goal love is the way we wend\n      Love is our parallel unending line\n        Whose only perfect Parallel is Christ\n    Beginning not begun End without end:\n        For He Who hath the heart of God sufficed\n      Can satisfy all hearts--yea thine and mine.\n\n\n    8.\n\n    We feel and see with different hearts and eyes:--\n      Ah Christ if all our hearts could meet in Thee\n      How well it were for them and well for me\n    Our hearts Thy dear accepted sacrifice.\n    Thou only Life of hearts and Light of eyes\n      Our life our light if once we turn to Thee\n      So be it O Lord to them and so to me;\n    Be all alike Thine own dear sacrifice.\n    Thou Who by death hast ransomed us from death\n      Thyself God's sole well-pleasing Sacrifice\n        Thine only sacred Self I plead with Thee:\n        Make Thou it well for them and well for me\n    That Thou hast given us souls and wills and breath;\n      And hearts to love Thee; and to see Thee eyes.\n\n\n    9.\n\n    Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar\n      Beyond the drawings each of other's strength:\n      One blazes through the brief bright summer's length\n    Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;\n      While one unchangeable upon a throne\n      Broods o'er the frozen heart of earth alone\n    Content to reign the bright particular star\n      Of some who wander or of some who groan.\n    They own no drawings each of other's strength\n      Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy\n        Nor veer along their courses each toward each:\n      Yet are their orbits pitched in harmony\n    Of one dear heaven across whose depth and length\n        Mayhap they talk together without speech.\n\n\n    10.\n\n    Tread softly! all the earth is holy ground.\n      It may be could we look with seeing eyes\n      This spot we stand on is a Paradise\n    Where dead have come to life and lost been found\n    Where Faith has triumphed Martyrdom been crowned\n      Where fools have foiled the wisdom of the wise;\n      From this same spot the dust of saints may rise\n    And the King's prisoners come to light unbound.\n    O earth earth earth hear thou thy Maker's Word:\n      \"Thy dead thou shalt give up nor hide thy slain\"--\n      Some who went weeping forth shall come again\n        Rejoicing from the east or from the west\n    As doves fly to their windows love's own bird\n        Contented and desirous to the nest.1\n\n\n    Footnote 1:\n\n    \"Quali colombe dal disio chiamate\n     Con l'ali aperte e ferme al dolce nido\n     Volan per l'aer dal voler portate.\"\n\n                             Dante.\n\n    11.\n\n    Lifelong our stumbles lifelong our regret\n      Lifelong our efforts failing and renewed\n      While lifelong is our witness \"God is good:\"\n    Who bore with us till now bears with us yet\n    Who still remembers and will not forget\n      Who gives us light and warmth and daily food;\n      And gracious promises half understood\n    And glories half unveiled whereon to set\n    Our heart of hearts and eyes of our desire;\n      Uplifting us to longing and to love\n    Luring us upward from this world of mire\n      Urging us to press on and mount above\n      Ourselves and all we have had experience of\n    Mounting to Him in love's perpetual fire.\n\n\n    12.\n\n    A dream there is wherein we are fain to scream\n      While struggling with ourselves we cannot speak:\n      And much of all our waking life as weak\n    And misconceived eludes us like the dream.\n    For half life's seemings are not what they seem\n      And vain the laughs we laugh the shrieks we shriek;\n      Yea all is vain that mars the settled meek\n    Contented quiet of our daily theme.\n    When I was young I deemed that sweets are sweet:\n      But now I deem some searching bitters are\n      Sweeter than sweets and more refreshing far\n        And to be relished more and more desired\n    And more to be pursued on eager feet\n        On feet untired and still on feet though tired.\n\n\n    13.\n\n    Shame is a shadow cast by sin: yet shame\n      Itself may be a glory and a grace\n      Refashioning the sin-disfashioned face;\n    A nobler bruit than hollow-sounded fame\n    A new-lit lustre on a tarnished name\n      One virtue pent within an evil place\n      Strength for the fight and swiftness for the race\n    A stinging salve a life-requickening flame.\n    A salve so searching we may scarcely live\n      A flame so fierce it seems that we must die\n        An actual cautery thrust into the heart:\n        Nevertheless men die not of such smart;\n    And shame gives back what nothing else can give\n      Man to himself--then sets him up on high.\n\n\n    14.\n\n    When Adam and when Eve left Paradise\n      Did they love on and cling together still\n      Forgiving one another all that ill\n    The twain had wrought on such a different wise?\n    She propped upon his strength and he in guise\n      Of lover though of lord girt to fulfil\n      Their term of life and die when God should will;\n    Lie down and sleep and having slept arise.\n    Boast not against us O our enemy!\n      To-day we fall but we shall rise again;\n    We grope to-day to-morrow we shall see:\n        What is to-day that we should fear to-day?\n        A morrow cometh which shall sweep away\n      Thee and thy realm of change and death and pain.\n\n\n    15.\n\n    Let woman fear to teach and bear to learn\n      Remembering the first woman's first mistake.\n      Eve had for pupil the inquiring snake\n    Whose doubts she answered on a great concern;\n    But he the tables so contrived to turn\n      It next was his to give and hers to take;\n      Till man deemed poison sweet for her sweet sake\n    And fired a train by which the world must burn.\n    Did Adam love his Eve from first to last?\n      I think so; as we love who works us ill\n      And wounds us to the quick yet loves us still.\n    Love pardons the unpardonable past:\n    Love in a dominant embrace holds fast\n      His frailer self and saves without her will.\n\n\n    16.\n\n    Our teachers teach that one and one make two:\n      Later Love rules that one and one make one:\n      Abstruse the problems! neither need we shun\n    But skilfully to each should yield its due.\n    The narrower total seems to suit the few\n      The wider total suits the common run;\n      Each obvious in its sphere like moon or sun;\n    Both provable by me and both by you.\n    Befogged and witless in a wordy maze\n      A groping stroll perhaps may do us good;\n      If cloyed we are with much we have understood\n    If tired of half our dusty world and ways\n      If sick of fasting and if sick of food;--\n    And how about these long still-lengthening days?\n\n\n    17.\n\n    Something this foggy day a something which\n      Is neither of this fog nor of to-day\n      Has set me dreaming of the winds that play\n    Past certain cliffs along one certain beach\n      And turn the topmost edge of waves to spray:\n      Ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away\n    So out of reach while quite within my reach\n      As out of reach as India or Cathay!\n    I am sick of where I am and where I am not\n      I am sick of foresight and of memory\n      I am sick of all I have and all I see\n        I am sick of self and there is nothing new;\n    Oh weary impatient patience of my lot!--\n        Thus with myself: how fares it Friends with you?\n\n\n    18.\n\n    So late in Autumn half the world's asleep\n      And half the wakeful world looks pinched and pale;\n      For dampness now not freshness rides the gale;\n    And cold and colorless comes ashore the deep\n    With tides that bluster or with tides that creep;\n      Now veiled uncouthness wears an uncouth veil\n      Of fog not sultry haze; and blight and bale\n    Have done their worst and leaves rot on the heap.\n    So late in Autumn one forgets the Spring\n      Forgets the Summer with its opulence\n    The callow birds that long have found a wing\n      The swallows that more lately gat them hence:\n    Will anything like Spring will anything\n      Like Summer rouse one day the slumbering sense?\n\n\n    19.\n\n    Here now is Winter. Winter after all\n      Is not so drear as was my boding dream\n      While Autumn gleamed its latest watery gleam\n    On sapless leafage too inert to fall.\n    Still leaves and berries clothe my garden wall\n      Where ivy thrives on scantiest sunny beam;\n      Still here a bud and there a blossom seem\n    Hopeful and robin still is musical.\n    Leaves flowers and fruit and one delightful song\n      Remain; these days are short but now the nights\n      Intense and long hang out their utmost lights;\n    Such starry nights are long yet not too long;\n    Frost nips the weak while strengthening still the strong\n      Against that day when Spring sets all to rights.\n\n\n    20.\n\n    A hundred thousand birds salute the day:--\n      One solitary bird salutes the night:\n    Its mellow grieving wiles our grief away\n      And tunes our weary watches to delight;\n    It seems to sing the thoughts we cannot say\n      To know and sing them and to set them right;\n    Until we feel once more that May is May\n      And hope some buds may bloom without a blight.\n    This solitary bird outweighs outvies\n      The hundred thousand merry-making birds\n    Whose innocent warblings yet might make us wise\n    Would we but follow when they bid us rise\n      Would we but set their notes of praise to words\n    And launch our hearts up with them to the skies.\n\n\n    21.\n\n    A host of things I take on trust: I take\n      The nightingales on trust for few and far\n      Between those actual summer moments are\n    When I have heard what melody they make.\n    So chanced it once at Como on the Lake:\n      But all things then waxed musical; each star\n      Sang on its course each breeze sang on its car\n    All harmonies sang to senses wide-awake.\n    All things in tune myself not out of tune\n      Those nightingales were nightingales indeed:\n      Yet truly an owl had satisfied my need\n    And wrought a rapture underneath that moon\n      Or simple sparrow chirping from a reed;\n    For June that night glowed like a doubled June.\n\n\n    22.\n\n    The mountains in their overwhelming might\n      Moved me to sadness when I saw them first\n    And afterwards they moved me to delight;\n      Struck harmonies from silent chords which burst\n      Out into song a song by memory nursed;\n    Forever unrenewed by touch or sight\n    Sleeps the keen magic of each day or night\n      In pleasure and in wonder then immersed.\n    All Switzerland behind us on the ascent\n      All Italy before us we plunged down\n        St. Gothard garden of forget-me-not:\n        Yet why should such a flower choose such a spot?\n    Could we forget that way which once we went\n      Though not one flower had bloomed to weave its crown?\n\n\n    23.\n\n    Beyond the seas we know stretch seas unknown\n      Blue and bright-colored for our dim and green;\n      Beyond the lands we see stretch lands unseen\n    With many-tinted tangle overgrown;\n    And icebound seas there are like seas of stone\n      Serenely stormless as death lies serene;\n      And lifeless tracks of sand which intervene\n    Betwixt the lands where living flowers are blown.\n    This dead and living world befits our case\n      Who live and die: we live in wearied hope\n    We die in hope not dead; we run a race\n    To-day and find no present halting-place;\n      All things we see lie far within our scope\n    And still we peer beyond with craving face.\n\n\n    24.\n\n    The wise do send their hearts before them to\n      Dear bless\u00e9d Heaven despite the veil between;\n      The foolish nurse their hearts within the screen\n    Of this familiar world where all we do\n    Or have is old for there is nothing new:\n      Yet elder far that world we have not seen;\n      God's Presence antedates what else hath been:\n    Many the foolish seem the wise seem few.\n    Oh foolishest fond folly of a heart\n      Divided neither here nor there at rest!\n        That hankers after Heaven but clings to earth;\n        That neither here nor there knows thorough mirth\n    Half-choosing wholly missing the good part:--\n      Oh fool among the foolish in thy quest.\n\n\n    25.\n\n    When we consider what this life we lead\n      Is not and is; how full of toil and pain\n      How blank of rest and of substantial gain\n    Beset by hunger earth can never feed\n    And propping half our hearts upon a reed;\n      We cease to mourn lost treasures mourned in vain\n      Lost treasures we are fain and yet not fain\n    To fetch back for a solace of our need.\n    For who that feel this burden and this strain\n      This wide vacuity of hope and heart\n    Would bring their cherished well-beloved again:\n      To bleed with them and wince beneath the smart\n    To have with stinted bliss such lavish bane\n      To hold in lieu of all so poor a part?\n\n\n    26.\n\n    This Life is full of numbness and of balk\n      Of haltingness and baffled short-coming\n      Of promise unfulfilled of everything\n    That is puffed vanity and empty talk:\n    Its very bud hangs cankered on the stalk\n      Its very song-bird trails a broken wing\n      Its very Spring is not indeed like Spring\n    But sighs like Autumn round an aimless walk.\n    This Life we live is dead for all its breath;\n      Death's self it is set off on pilgrimage\n      Travelling with tottering steps the first short stage:\n        The second stage is one mere desert dust\n        Where Death sits veiled amid creation's rust:--\n    Unveil thy face O Death who art not Death.\n\n\n    27.\n\n    I have dreamed of Death:--what will it be to die\n      Not in a dream but in the literal truth\n      With all Death's adjuncts ghastly and uncouth\n    The pang that is the last and the last sigh?\n    Too dulled it may be for a last good-bye\n      Too comfortless for any one to soothe\n      A helpless charmless spectacle of ruth\n    Through long last hours so long while yet they fly.\n    So long to those who hopeless in their fear\n      Watch the slow breath and look for what they dread:\n    While I supine with ears that cease to hear\n        With eyes that glaze with heart-pulse running down\n      (Alas! no saint rejoicing on her bed)\n        May miss the goal at last may miss a crown.\n\n\n    28.\n\n    In life our absent friend is far away:\n      But death may bring our friend exceeding near\n      Show him familiar faces long so dear\n    And lead him back in reach of words we say.\n    He only cannot utter yea or nay\n      In any voice accustomed to our ear;\n      He only cannot make his face appear\n    And turn the sun back on our shadowed day.\n    The dead may be around us dear and dead;\n      The unforgotten dearest dead may be\n        Watching us with unslumbering eyes and heart\n    Brimful of words which cannot yet be said\n        Brimful of knowledge they may not impart\n      Brimful of love for you and love for me.\n\n\n\n    \"FOR THINE OWN SAKE O MY GOD.\"\n\n\n    Wearied of sinning wearied of repentance\n      Wearied of self I turn my God to Thee;\n    To Thee my Judge on Whose all-righteous sentence\n        Hangs mine eternity:\n    I turn to Thee I plead Thyself with Thee--\n        Be pitiful to me.\n\n    Wearied I loathe myself I loathe my sinning\n
