he knows\n    All he will know on earth, or need to know.\n\n    But there, beneath his willow tree,\n    His tribal, tutelary tree,\n    The tortured cat across his knee,\n    With hate, perhaps, a threat, maybe,\n    Lithuania looks at me.", "A SILVER CUP": "    In Venice,\n    Under the Rialto bridge, one summer morning,\n    In a mean shop I bought a silver goblet.\n    It was a place of poor and sordid barter,\n    A damp hole filled with rags and rusty kettles,\n    Fire-tongs and broken grates and mended bellows,\n    And common crockery, coarse in use and fashion.\n    Everything spoke the desperate needs of body,\n    The breaking up and sale of wretched shelters,\n    The frail continuance even of hunger.\n    Misery under all--and that so fleeting!\n    The fight to fill the pots and pans soon over,\n    And then this wretched litter left from living.\n\n    The goblet\n    Stood in a dusty window full of charcoal,\n    The only bright, the only gracious object.\n    Because my heart was full to overflowing,\n    Because my day to weep had not come near me,\n    Because the world was full of love, I bought it.\n    From all the wreckage there I took no warning;--\n    Those ugly things outlasting hearts and houses,\n    And all the life that men build into houses.\n    Out of the jaws of hunger toothed with iron,\n    Into the sun exultantly I bore it.\n    Then, in the brightness of the summer sunshine,\n    I saw the loops and flourishes of letters,\n    The scattered trace of some outworn inscription,--\n    Six lines or more, rubbed flat into the silver,\n    Dashes and strokes, like rain-marks in a snowdrift.\n    Was it a prize, perhaps, or gift of friendship?\n    Was its inscription hope, or recognition?\n    Not heeding still, I bade my oarsman quicken,\n    And once ashore, across the Square I hastened,\n    Precipitate through the idlers and the pigeons,\n    Behind the Clock Tower, to a cunning craftsman,\n    There to exhort and urge the deft engraver,\n    And crowd upon my cup another story;\n    A name and promise in my memory singing.\n\n    In Venice,\n    Under the Rialto bridge, I bought you.\n    Now you come back to me, such long years after,\n    Your promise never kept, your hope defeated,\n    Your legend now a thing for tears and laughter;--\n    Though both your names are names of living people,\n    Cut by the steady hand of that engraver\n    While I stood over him and urged his deftness.\n    He played the part; nor stopped to smile and tell me\n    That for such words his art was too enduring.\n    His living was to cut such stuff in silver!\n    And now I have you, what to do, I wonder?\n    The names, another smith can soon efface them,--\n    But leave, so beautifully cut, the legend.\n    Not from a poet\u2019s book, but from the living\n    Sad mouth of a young peasant boy, I took it;\n    Four words, which mean that life is sweet together.\n\n    In some dark junk-shop window I shall leave you,\n    Some place of poor effects from broken houses,\n    Where desperate women go to sell a saucepan\n    And frightened men to buy a baby\u2019s cradle.\n    Here, in New York, a city full of exiles,\n    Short marriages and early deaths and heart-breaks:\n    In some such window, with the blue glass vases,\n    The busts of Presidents in plaster, gilded,\n    Pawned watches, and the rings and chains and bracelets\n    Given for love and sold for utter anguish,\n    There I shall leave you, a sole gracious object.\n\n    And hope some blind, bright eye will one day spy you--\n    Some boy with too much love and empty pockets\n    May read with quickening pulse your brief inscription,\n    Cut in his mother-language, half forgotten,\n    Four words which mean that life is sweet together;\n    Rush in and count his coins upon the table,\n    (A cup his own as if his heart had made it!)\n    And bear you off to one who hopes as he does.\n    So, one day, may the wish, for you, be granted.\n    They will not know, these two, the names you cover;\n    Mine and another, razed by violence from you,\n    Nor his, worn down by time, the first possessor\u2019s--\n    Who had his story, which you never told me.", "RECOGNITION": "    The old volcanic mountains\n    That slope up from the sea--\n    They dream and dream a thousand years\n    And watch what-is-to-be.\n\n    What gladness shines upon them\n    When, white as white sea-foam,\n    To the old, old ports of Beauty\n    A new sail comes home!", "GOING HOME": "      (Burlington Route)\n\n\n    How smoothly the trains run beyond the Missouri;\n    Even in my sleep I know when I have crossed the river.\n    The wheels turn as if they were glad to go;\n    The sharp curves and windings left behind,\n    The roadway wide open,\n    (_The crooked straight_\n    _And the rough places plain._)\n\n    They run smoothly, they run softly, too.\n    There is not noise enough to trouble the lightest sleeper.\n    Nor jolting to wake the weary-hearted.\n    I open my window and let the air blow in,\n    The air of morning,\n    That smells of grass and earth--\n    Earth, the grain-giver.\n\n    How smoothly the trains run beyond the Missouri;\n    Even in my sleep I know when I have crossed the river.\n    The wheels turn as if they were glad to go;\n    They run like running water,\n    Like Youth, running away...\n    They spin bright along the bright rails,\n    Singing and humming,\n    Singing and humming.\n    They run remembering,\n    They run rejoicing,\n    As if they, too, were going home.", "metadata": "cather|Willa Cather|1873|1947|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willa_Cather"}
