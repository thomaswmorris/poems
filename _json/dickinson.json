HIGGINSON\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nThe eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's\npoems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern\nartificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the\nqualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest\nthemes--life and love and death. That \"irresistible needle-touch\"\nas one of her best critics has called it piercing at once the very\ncore of a thought has found a response as wide and sympathetic as\nit has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling\npower.  This second volume while open to the same criticism as to\nform with its predecessor shows also the same shining beauties.\n\nAlthough Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending\noccasional poems to friends and correspondents the full extent of\nher writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend \"H.H.\"\nmust at least have suspected it for in a letter dated 5th\nSeptember 1884 she wrote:--\n\n\nMY DEAR FRIEND-- What portfolios full of verses\nyou must have! It is a cruel wrong to your \"day and\ngeneration\" that you will not give them light.\n\nIf such a thing should happen as that I should outlive\nyou I wish you would make me your literary legatee\nand executor. Surely after you are what is called\n\"dead\" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you\nhave left behind should be cheered and pleased by your\nverses will you not? You ought to be. I do not think\nwe have a right to withhold from the world a word or\na thought any more than a deed which might help a\nsingle soul. . . .\n\n                Truly yours\n\n                        HELEN JACKSON.\n\n\nThe \"portfolios\" were found shortly after Emily Dickinson's death\nby her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had\nbeen carefully copied on sheets of note-paper and tied in little\nfascicules each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear\nevidence of having been thrown off at white heat still more had\nreceived thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of\nrather perplexing foot-notes affording large choice of words and\nphrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends sometimes one\nform sometimes another is found to have been used. Without\nimportant exception her friends have generously placed at the\ndisposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and\nthese have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several\nrenderings of the same verse.\n\nTo what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been\nsubjected had she published them herself we cannot know. They\nshould be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and\nsuggestive sketches of an artist intended to be embodied at some\ntime in the finished picture.\n\nEmily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the\nwinter of 1862. In a letter to oone of the present Editors the\nApril following she says \"I made no verse but one or two until\nthis winter.\"\n\nThe handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate running\nItalian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in\nbreadth of thought it grew bolder and more abrupt until in her\nlatest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its\nfellows. In most of her poems particularly the later ones\neverything by way of punctuation was discarded except numerous\ndashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of\na page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and\nstrong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of\nthe earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date\nthe handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general\nchronologic accuracy.\n\nAs a rule the verses were without titles; but \"A Country Burial\"\n\"A Thunder-Storm\" \"The Humming-Bird\" and a few others were named\nby their author frequently at the end--sometimes only in the\naccompanying note if sent to a friend.\n\nThe variation of readings with the fact that she often wrote in\npencil and not always clearly have at times thrown a good deal of\nresponsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not\nabsolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her\nrendering is part of herself and not lightly to be touched; for it\nseems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and\nmore usual rhymes.\n\nLike impressionist pictures or Wagner's rugged music the very\nabsence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily\nDickinson's exacting hands the especial intrinsic fitness of a\nparticular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything\nvirtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of\ninner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed and\nthe \"thought-rhyme\" appears frequently--appealing indeed to an\nunrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.\n\nEmily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness.\nEvery subject was proper ground for legitimate study even the\nsombre facts of death and burial and the unknown life beyond. She\ntouches these themes sometimes lightly sometimes almost\nhumorously more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is\nnever by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while as one critic\nhas said she may exhibit toward God \"an Emersonian self-possession\"\nit was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced\nas it is rare.\n\nShe had tried society and the world and found them lacking.  She\nwas not an invalid and she lived in seclusion from no\nlove-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature\nintrospective to a high degree whose best thought could not exist\nin pretence.\n\nStorm wind the wild March sky sunsets and dawns; the birds and\nbees butterflies and flowers of her garden with a few trusted\nhuman friends were sufficient companionship. The coming of the\nfirst robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of\npope; the first red leaf hurrying through \"the altered air\" an\nepoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or\nmelancholy she lived in its presence.\n\n                                MABEL LOOMIS TODD.\n\n        AMHERST MASSACHUSETTS\n            August I891.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    My nosegays are for captives;\n       Dim long-expectant eyes\n    Fingers denied the plucking\n       Patient till paradise\n\n    To such if they should whisper\n       Of morning and the moor\n    They bear no other errand\n       And I no other prayer.\n\n\n\n\nI.
