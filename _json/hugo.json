That knew no flush save modesty's till now.\n\n     Opening with cautious hands the reedy couch,\n       She brought the rescued infant slowly out\n     Beyond the humid sands; at her approach\n       Her curious maidens hurried round about\n     To kiss the new-born brow with gentlest touch;\n       Greeting the child with smiles, and bending nigh\n       Their faces o'er his large, astonished eye!\n\n     Haste thou who, from afar, in doubt and fear,\n       Dost watch, with straining eyes, the fated boy--\n     The loved of heaven! come like a stranger near,\n       And clasp young Moses

  Of some poor wretch or fool who lived that way--\n     You--or myself, perhaps--I cannot say--\n     Along the road, scarce heeding where it tended,\n     Their way in sullen, sulky silence wended;\n\n     For, though twin sisters, these two charming creatures,\n     Rivals in hideousness of form and features,\n     Wasted no love between them as they went.\n         Pale Avarice,\n         With gloating eyes,\n     And back and shoulders almost double bent,\n     Was hugging close that fatal box\n         For which she's ever on the watch\n         Some glance to catch\n     Suspiciously directed to its locks;\n     And Envy, too, no doubt with silent winking\n         At her green, greedy orbs, no single minute\n     Withdrawn from it, was hard a-thinking\n         Of all the shining dollars in it.\n\n     The only words that Avarice could utter,\n     Her constant doom, in a low, frightened mutter,\n         \"There's not enough, enough, yet in my store!\"\n     While Envy, as she scanned the glittering sight,\n     Groaned as she gnashed her yellow teeth with spite,\n         \"She's more than me, more, still forever more!\"\n\n     Thus, each in her own fashion, as they wandered,\n     Upon the coffer's precious contents pondered,\n         When suddenly, to their surprise,\n         The God Desire stood before their eyes.\n     Desire, that courteous deity who grants\n     All wishes, prayers, and wants;\n     Said he to the two sisters: \"Beauteous ladies,\n     As I'm a gentleman, my task and trade is\n         To be the slave of your behest--\n     Choose therefore at your own sweet will and pleasure,\n     Honors or treasure!\n         Or in one word, whatever you'd like best.\n     But, let us understand each other--she\n     Who speaks the first, her prayer shall certainly\n         Receive--the other, the same boon _redoubled!_\"\n\n     Imagine how our amiable pair,\n     At this proposal, all so frank and fair,\n         Were mutually troubled!\n     Misers and enviers, of our human race,\n     Say, what would you have done in such a case?\n     Each of the sisters murmured, sad and low\n         \"What boots it, oh, Desire, to me to have\n         Crowns, treasures, all the goods that heart can crave,\n     Or power divine bestow,\n     Since still another must have always more?\"\n\n     So each, lest she should speak before\n     The other, hesitating slow and long\n     Till the god lost all patience, held her tongue.\n         He was enraged, in such a way,\n         To be kept waiting there all day,\n     With two such beauties in the public road;\n         Scarce able to be civil even,\n         He wished them both--well, not in heaven.\n\n     Envy at last the silence broke,\n         And smiling, with malignant sneer,\n         Upon her sister dear,\n           Who stood in expectation by,\n     Ever implacable and cruel, spoke\n           \"I would be blinded of _one_ eye!\"", "KING

Encoffined he was laid.\n     Of Aarhuus came the Bishop prayers to say,\n     And sang a hymn upon his tomb, and held\n     That Canute was a saint--Canute the Great,\n     That from his memory breathed celestial perfume,\n     And that they saw him, they the priests, in glory,\n     Seated at God's right hand, a prophet crowned.\n\n     I.\n\n                                   Evening came,\n     And hushed the organ in the holy place,\n     And the priests, issuing from the temple doors,\n     Left the dead king in peace. Then he arose,\n     Opened his gloomy eyes, and grasped his sword,\n     And went forth loftily. The massy walls\n     Yielded before the phantom, like a mist.\n\n     There is a sea where Aarhuus, Altona,\n     And Elsinore's vast domes and shadowy towers\n     Glass in deep waters. Over this he went\n     Dark, and still Darkness listened for his foot\n     Inaudible, itself being but a dream.\n     Straight to Mount Savo went he, gnawed by time,\n     And thus, \"O mountain buffeted of storms,\n     Give me of thy huge mantle of deep snow\n     To frame a winding-sheet.\" The mountain knew him,\n     Nor dared refuse, and with his sword Canute\n     Cut from his flank white snow, enough to make\n     The garment he desired, and then he cried,\n     \"Old mountain! death is dumb, but tell me thou\n     The way to God.\" More deep each dread ravine\n     And hideous hollow yawned, and sadly thus\n     Answered that hoar associate of the clouds:\n     \"Spectre, I know not, I am always here.\"\n     Canute departed, and with head erect,\n     All white and ghastly in his robe of snow,\n     Went forth into great silence and great night\n     By Iceland and Norway. After him\n     Gloom swallowed up the universe. He stood\n     A sovran kingdomless, a lonely ghost\n     Confronted with Immensity. He saw\n     The awful Infinite, at whose portal pale\n     Lightning sinks dying; Darkness, skeleton\n     Whose joints are nights, and utter Formlessness\n     Moving confusedly in the horrible dark\n     Inscrutable and blind. No star was there,\n     Yet something like a haggard gleam; no sound\n     But the dull tide of Darkness, and her dumb\n     And fearful shudder. \"'Tis the tomb,\" he said,\n     \"God is beyond!\" Three steps he took, then cried:\n     'Twas deathly as the grave, and not a voice\n     Responded, nor came any breath to sway\n     The snowy mantle, with unsullied white\n     Emboldening the spectral wanderer.\n     Sudden he marked how, like a gloomy star,\n     A spot grew broad upon his livid robe;\n     Slowly it widened, raying darkness forth;\n     And Canute proved it with his spectral hands\n     It was a drop of blood.\n\n\n     II.\n\n     But he saw nothing; space was black--no sound.\n     \"Forward,\" said Canute, raising his proud head.\n     There fell a second stain beside the first,\n     Then it grew larger, and the Cimbrian chief\n     Stared at the thick vague darkness, and saw naught.\n     Still as a bloodhound follows on his track,\n     Sad he went on. 'There fell a third red stain\n     On the white winding-sheet. He had never fled;\n     Howbeit Canute forward went no more,\n     But turned on that side where the sword arm hangs.\n     A drop of blood, as if athwart a dream,\n     Fell on the shroud, and reddened his right hand.\n     Then, as in reading one turns back a page,\n     A second time he changed his course, and turned\n     To the dim left. There fell a drop of blood.\n     Canute drew back, trembling to be alone,\n     And wished he had not left his burial couch.\n     But, when a blood-drop fell again, he stopped,\n     Stooped his pale head, and tried to make a prayer.\n     Then fell a drop, and the prayer died away\n     In savage terror. Darkly he moved on,\n     A hideous spectre hesitating, white,\n     And ever as he went, a drop of blood\n     Implacably from the darkness broke away\n     And stained that awful whiteness. He beheld\n     Shaking, as doth a poplar in the wind,\n     Those stains grow darker and more numerous:\n     Another, and another, and another.\n     They seem to light up that funereal gloom,\n     And mingling in the folds of that white sheet,\n     Made it a cloud of blood. He went, and went,\n     And still from that unfathomable vault\n     The red blood dropped upon him drop by drop,\n     Always, for ever--without noise, as though\n     From the black feet of some night-gibbeted corpse.\n     Alas! Who wept those formidable tears?\n     The Infinite!--Toward Heaven, of the good\n     Attainable, through the wild sea of night,\n     That hath not ebb nor flow, Canute went on,\n     And ever walking, came to a closed door,\n     That from beneath showed a mysterious light.\n     Then he looked down upon his winding-sheet,\n     For that was the great place, the sacred place,\n     That was a portion of the light of God,\n     And from behind that door Hosannas rang.\n     The winding-sheet was red, and Canute stopped.\n     This is why Canute from the light of day\n     Draws ever back, and hath not dared appear\n     Before the Judge whose face is as the sun.\n     This is why still remaineth the dark king\n     Out in the night, and never having power\n     To bring his robe back to its first pure state,\n     But feeling at each step a blood-drop fall,\n     Wanders eternally 'neath the vast black heaven.", "THE BOY-KING'S PRAYER": "     _(\"Le cheval galopait toujours.\")_\n\n\n     The good steed flew o'er river and o'er plain,\n     Till far away,--no need of spur or rein.\n     The child, half rapture, half solicitude,\n     Looks back anon, in fear to be pursued;\n     Shakes lest some raging brother of his sire\n     Leap from those rocks that o'er the path aspire.\n\n     On the rough granite bridge, at evening's fall,\n     The white horse paused by Compostella's wall,\n     ('Twas good St. James that reared those arches tall,)\n     Through the dim mist stood out each belfry dome,\n     And the boy hailed the paradise of home.\n\n     Close to the bridge, set on high stage, they meet\n     A Christ of stone, the Virgin at his feet.\n     A taper lighted that dear pardoning face,\n     More tender in the shade that wrapped the place,\n     And the child stayed his horse, and in the shine\n     Of the wax taper knelt down at the shrine.\n\n     \"O, my good God!

What matters age,\n     The years but fire him with a holy rage.\n     Though late from Palestine, he is not spent,--\n     With age he wrestles, firm in his intent.\n\n     III.\n\n     IN THE FOREST.\n\n     If in the woodland traveller there had been\n     That eve, who lost himself, strange sight he'd seen.\n     Quite in the forest's heart a lighted space\n     Arose to view; in that deserted place\n     A lone, abandoned hall with light aglow\n     The long neglect of centuries did show.\n     The castle-towers of Corbus in decay\n     Were girt by weeds and growths that had their way.\n     Couch-grass and ivy, and wild eglantine\n     In subtle scaling warfare all combine.\n     Subject to such attacks three hundred years,\n     The donjon yields, and ruin now appears,\n     E'en as by leprosy the wild boars die,\n     In moat the crumbled battlements now lie;\n     Around the snake-like bramble twists its rings;\n     Freebooter sparrows come on daring wings\n     To perch upon the swivel-gun, nor heed\n     Its murmuring growl when pecking in their greed\n     The mulberries ripe. With insolence the thorn\n     Thrives on the desolation so forlorn.\n     But winter brings revenges; then the Keep\n     Wakes all vindictive from its seeming sleep,\n     Hurls down the heavy rain, night after night,\n     Thanking the season's all-resistless might;\n     And, when the gutters choke, its gargoyles four\n     From granite mouths in anger spit and pour\n     Upon the hated ivy hour by hour.\n\n     As to the sword rust is, so lichens are\n     To towering citadel with which they war.\n     Alas! for Corbus--dreary, desolate,\n     And yet its woes the winters mitigate.\n     It rears itself among convulsive throes\n     That shake its ruins when the tempest blows.\n     Winter, the savage warrior, pleases well,\n     With its storm clouds, the mighty citadel,--\n     Restoring it to life. The lightning flash\n     Strikes like a thief and flies; the winds that crash\n     Sound like a clarion, for the Tempest bluff\n     Is Battle's sister. And when wild and rough,\n     The north wind blows, the tower exultant cries\n     \"Behold me!\" When hail-hurling gales arise\n     Of blustering Equinox, to fan the strife,\n     It stands erect, with martial ardor rife,\n     A joyous soldier! When like yelping hound\n     Pursued by wolves, November comes to bound\n     In joy from rock to rock, like answering cheer\n     To howling January now so near--\n     \"Come on!\" the Donjon cries to blasts o'erhead--\n     It has seen Attila, and knows not dread.\n     Oh, dismal nights of contest in the rain\n     And mist, that furious would the battle gain,\n     'The tower braves all, though angry skies pour fast\n     The flowing torrents, river-like and vast.\n     From their eight pinnacles the gorgons bay,\n     And scattered monsters, in their stony way,\n     Are growling heard; the rampart lions gnaw\n     The misty air and slush with granite maw,\n     The sleet upon the griffins spits, and all\n     The Saurian monsters, answering to the squall,\n     Flap wings; while through the broken ceiling fall\n     Torrents of rain upon the forms beneath,\n     Dragons and snak'd Medusas gnashing teeth\n     In the dismantled rooms. Like armored knight\n     The granite Castle fights with all its might,\n     Resisting through the winter. All in vain,\n     The heaven's bluster, January's rain,\n     And those dread elemental powers we call\n     The Infinite--the whirlwinds that appall--\n     Thunder and waterspouts; and winds that shake\n     As 'twere a tree its ripened fruit to take.\n     The winds grow wearied, warring with the tower,\n     The noisy North is out of breath, nor power\n     Has any blast old Corbus to defeat,\n     It still has strength their onslaughts worst to meet.\n     Thus, spite of briers and thistles, the old tower\n     Remains triumphant through the darkest hour;\n     Superb as pontiff, in the forest shown,\n     Its rows of battlements make triple crown;\n     At eve, its silhouette is finely traced\n     Immense and black--showing the Keep is placed\n     On rocky throne, sublime and high; east, west,\n     And north and south, at corners four, there rest\n     Four mounts; Aptar, where flourishes the pine,\n     And Toxis, where the elms grow green and fine;\n     Crobius and Bleyda, giants in their might,\n     Against the stormy winds to stand and fight,\n     And these above its diadem uphold\n     Night's living canopy of clouds unrolled.\n\n     The herdsman fears, and thinks its shadow creeps\n     To follow him; and superstition keeps\n     Such hold that Corbus as a terror reigns;\n     Folks say the Fort a target still remains\n     For the Black Archer--and that it contains\n     The cave where the Great Sleeper still sleeps sound.\n     The country people all the castle round\n     Are frightened easily, for legends grow\n     And mix with phantoms of the mind; we know\n     The hearth is cradle of such fantasies,\n     And in the smoke the cotter sees arise\n     From low-thatched but he traces cause of dread.\n     Thus rendering thanks that he is lowly bred,\n     Because from such none look for valorous deeds.\n     The peasant flies the Tower, although it leads\n     A noble knight to seek adventure there,\n     And, from his point of honor, dangers dare.\n\n     Thus very rarely passer-by is seen;\n     But--it might be with twenty years between,\n     Or haply less--at unfixed interval\n     There would a semblance be of festival.\n     A Seneschal and usher would appear,\n     And troops of servants many baskets bear.\n     Then were, in mystery, preparations made,\n     And they departed--for till night none stayed.\n     But 'twixt the branches gazers could descry\n     The blackened hall lit up most brilliantly.\n     None dared approach--and this the reason why.\n\n     IV.\n\n     THE CUSTOM OF LUSACE.\n\n     When died a noble Marquis of Lusace\n     'Twas custom for the heir who filled his place\n     Before assuming princely pomp and power\n     To sup one night in Corbus' olden tower.\n     From this weird meal he passed to the degree\n     Of Prince and Margrave; nor could ever he\n     Be thought brave knight, or she--if woman claim\n     The rank--be reckoned of unblemished fame\n     Till they had breathed the air of ages gone,\n     The funeral odors, in the nest alone\n     Of its dead masters. Ancient was the race;\n     To trace the upward stem of proud Lusace\n     Gives one a vertigo; descended they\n     From ancestor of Attila, men say;\n     Their race to him--through Pagans--they hark back;\n     Becoming Christians, race they thought to track\n     Through Lechus, Plato, Otho to combine\n     With Ursus, Stephen, in a lordly line.\n     Of all those masters of the country round\n     That were on Northern Europe's boundary found--\n     At first were waves and then the dykes were reared--\n     Corbus in double majesty appeared,\n     Castle on hill and town upon the plain;\n     And one who mounted on the tower could gain\n     A view beyond the pines and rocks, of spires\n     That pierce the shade the distant scene acquires;\n     A walled town is it, but 'tis not ally\n     Of the old citadel's proud majesty;\n     Unto itself belonging this remained.\n     Often a castle was thus self-sustained\n     And equalled towns; witness in Lombardy\n     Crama, and Plato too in Tuscany,\n     And in Apulia Barletta;--each one\n     Was powerful as a town, and dreaded none.\n     Corbus ranked thus; its precincts seemed to hold\n     The reflex of its mighty kings of old;\n     Their great events had witness in these walls,\n     Their marriages were here and funerals,\n     And mostly here it was that they were born;\n     And here crowned Barons ruled with pride and scorn;\n     Cradle of Scythian majesty this place.\n     Now each new master of this ancient race\n     A duty owed to ancestors which he\n     Was bound to carry on. The law's decree\n     It was that he should pass alone the night\n     Which made him king, as in their solemn sight.\n     Just at the forest's edge a clerk was met\n     With wine in sacred cup and purpose set,\n     A wine mysterious, which the heir must drink\n     To cause deep slumber till next day's soft brink.\n     Then to the castle tower he wends his way,\n     And finds a supper laid with rich display.\n     He sups and sleeps: then to his slumbering eyes\n     The shades of kings from Bela all arise.\n     None dare the tower to enter on this night,\n     But when the morning dawns, crowds are in sight\n     The dreamer to deliver,--whom half dazed,\n     And with the visions of the night amazed,\n     They to the old church take, where rests the dust\n     Of Borivorus; then the bishop must,\n     With fervent blessings on his eyes and mouth,\n     Put in his hands the stony hatchets both,\n     With which--even like death impartially--\n     Struck Attila, with one arm dexterously\n     The south, and with the other arm the north.\n\n     This day the town the threatening flag set forth\n     Of Marquis Swantibore, the monster he\n     Who in the wood tied up his wife, to be\n     Devoured by wolves, together with the bull\n     Of which with jealousy his heart was full.\n\n     Even when woman took the place of heir\n     The tower of Corbus claimed the supper there;\n     'Twas law--the woman trembled, but must dare.\n\n     V.\n\n     THE MARCHIONESS MAHAUD.\n\n     Niece of the Marquis--John the Striker named--\n     Mahaud to-day the marquisate has claimed.\n     A noble dame--the crown is hers by right:\n     As woman she has graces that delight.\n     A queen devoid of beauty is not queen,\n     She needs the royalty of beauty's mien;\n     God in His harmony has equal ends\n     For cedar that resists, and reed that bends,\n     And good it is a woman sometimes rules,\n     Holds in her hand the power, and manners schools,\n     And laws and mind;--succeeding master proud,\n     With gentle voice and smile she leads the crowd,\n     The sombre human troop. But sweet Mahaud\n     On evil days had fallen; gentle, good,\n     Alas! she held the sceptre like a flower;\n     Timid yet gay, imprudent for the hour,\n     And careless too. With Europe all in throes,\n     Though twenty years she now already knows,\n     She has refused to marry, although oft\n     Entreated. It is time an arm less soft\n     Than hers--a manly arm--supported her;\n     Like to the rainbow she, one might aver,\n     Shining on high between the cloud and rain,\n     Or like the ewe that gambols on the plain\n     Between the bear and tiger; innocent,\n     She has two neighbors of most foul intent:\n     For foes the Beauty has, in life's pure spring,\n     The German Emp'ror and the Polish King.\n\n     VI.\n\n     THE TWO NEIGHBORS.\n\n     The difference this betwixt the evil pair,\n     Faithless to God--for laws without a care--\n     One was the claw, the other one the will\n     Controlling. Yet to mass they both went still,\n     And on the rosary told their beads each day.\n     But none the less the world believed that they\n     Unto the powers of hell their souls had sold.\n     Even in whispers men each other told\n     The details of the pact which they had signed\n     With that dark power, the foe of human kind;\n     In whispers, for the crowd had mortal dread\n     Of them so high, and woes that they had spread.\n     One might be vengeance and the other hate,\n     Yet lived they side by side, in powerful state\n     And close alliance. All the people near\n     From red horizon dwelt in abject fear,\n     Mastered by them; their figures darkly grand\n     Had ruddy reflex from the wasted land,\n     And fires, and towns they sacked. Besides the one,\n     Like David, poet was, the other shone\n     As fine musician--rumor spread their fame,\n     Declaring them divine, until each name\n     In Italy's fine sonnets met with praise.\n     The ancient hierarch in those old days\n     Had custom strange, a now forgotten thing,\n     It was a European plan that King\n     Of France was marquis, and th' imperial head\n     Of Germany was duke; there was no need\n     To class the other kings, but barons they,\n     Obedient vassals unto Rome, their stay.\n     The King of Poland was but simple knight,\n     Yet now, for once, had strange unwonted right,\n     And, as exception to the common state,\n     This one Sarmatian King was held as great\n     As German Emperor; and each knew how\n     His evil part to play, nor mercy show.\n     The German had one aim, it was to take\n     All land he could, and it his own to make.\n     The Pole already having Baltic shore,\n     Seized Celtic ports, still needing more and more.\n     On all the Northern Sea his crafts roused fear:\n     Iceland beheld his demon navy near.\n     Antwerp the German burnt; and Prussias twain\n     Bowed to the yoke. The Polish King was fain\n     To help the Russian Spotocus--his aid\n     Was like the help that in their common trade\n     A sturdy butcher gives a weaker one.\n     The King it is who seizes, and this done,\n     The Emp'ror pillages, usurping right\n     In war Teutonic, settled but by might.\n     The King in Jutland cynic footing gains,\n     The weak coerced, the while with cunning pains\n     The strong are duped. But 'tis a law they make\n     That their accord themselves should never break.\n     From Arctic seas to cities Transalpine,\n     Their hideous talons, curved for sure rapine,\n     Scrape o'er and o'er the mournful continent,\n     Their plans succeed, and each is well content.\n     Thus under Satan's all paternal care\n     They brothers are, this royal bandit pair.\n     Oh, noxious conquerors! with transient rule\n     Chimera heads--ambition can but fool.\n     Their misty minds but harbor rottenness\n     Loathsome and fetid, and all barrenness--\n     Their deeds to ashes turn, and, hydra-bred,\n     The mystic skeleton is theirs to dread.\n     The daring German and the cunning Pole\n     Noted to-day a woman had control\n     Of lands, and watched Mahaud like evil spies;\n     And from the Emp'ror's cruel mouth--with dyes\n     Of wrath empurpled--came these words of late:\n     \"The empire wearies of the wallet weight\n     Hung at its back--this High and Low Lusace,\n     Whose hateful load grows heavier apace,\n     That now a woman holds its ruler's place.\"\n     Threatening, and blood suggesting, every word;\n     The watchful Pole was silent--but he heard.\n\n     Two monstrous dangers; but the heedless one\n     Babbles and smiles, and bids all care begone--\n     Likes lively speech--while all the poor she makes\n     To love her, and the taxes off she takes.\n     A life of dance and pleasure she has known--\n     A woman always; in her jewelled crown\n     It is the pearl she loves--not cutting gems,\n     For these can wound, and mark men's diadems.\n     She pays the hire of Homer's copyists,\n     And in the Courts of Love presiding, lists.\n\n     Quite recently unto her Court have come\n     Two men--unknown their names or native home,\n     Their rank or race; but one plays well the lute,\n     The other is a troubadour; both suit\n     The taste of Mahaud, when on summer eve,\n     'Neath opened windows, they obtain her leave\n     To sing upon the terrace, and relate\n     The charming tales that do with music mate.\n     In August the Moravians have their f\u00eate,\n     But it is radiant June in which Lusace\n     Must consecrate her noble Margrave race.\n     Thus in the weird and old ancestral tower\n     For Mahaud now has come the fateful hour,\n     The lonely supper which her state decrees.\n     What matters this to flowers, and birds, and trees,\n     And clouds and fountains? That the people may\n     Still bear their yoke--have kings to rule alway?\n     The water flows, the wind in passing by\n     In murmuring tones takes up the questioning cry.\n\n     VII.\n\n     THE BANQUET HALL.\n\n     The old stupendous hall has but one door,\n     And in the dusk it seems that more and more\n     The walls recede in space unlimited.\n     At the far end there is a table spread\n     That in the dreary void with splendor shines;\n     For ceiling we behold but rafter lines.\n     The table is arranged for one sole guest,\n     A solitary chair doth near it rest,\n     Throne-like, 'neath canopy that droopeth down\n     From the black beams; upon the walls are shown\n     The painted histories of the olden might,\n     The King of the Wends Thassilo's stern fight\n     On land with Nimrod, and on ocean wide\n     With Neptune. Rivers too personified\n     Appear--the Rhine as by the Meuse betrayed,\n     And fading groups of Odin in the shade,\n     And the wolf Fenrir and the Asgard snake.\n     One might the place for dragons' stable take.\n     The only lights that in the shed appear\n     Spring from the table's giant chandelier\n     With seven iron branches--brought from hell\n     By Attila Archangel, people tell,\n     When he had conquered Mammon--and they say\n     That seven souls were the first flames that day.\n     This banquet hall looks an abyss outlined\n     With shadowy vagueness, though indeed we find\n     In the far depth upon the table spread\n     A sudden, strong, and glaring light is shed,\n     Striking upon the goldsmith's burnished works,\n     And on the pheasants killed by traitor hawks.\n     Loaded the table is with viands cold,\n     Ewers and flagons, all enough of old\n     To make a love feast. All the napery\n     Was Friesland's famous make; and fair to see\n     The dishes, silver-gilt and bordered round\n     With flowers; for fruit, here strawberries were found\n     And citrons, apples too, and nectarines.\n     The wooden bowls were carved in cunning lines\n     By peasants of the Murg, whose skilful hands\n     With patient toil reclaim the barren lands\n     And make their gardens flourish on a rock,\n     Or mountain where we see the hunters flock.\n     Gold fountain-cup, with handles Florentine,\n     Shows Acteons horned, though armed and booted fine,\n     Who fight with sword in hand against the hounds.\n     Roses and gladioles make up bright mounds\n     Of flowers, with juniper and aniseed;\n     While sage, all newly cut for this great need,\n     Covers the Persian carpet that is spread\n     Beneath the table, and so helps to shed\n     Around a perfume of the balmy spring.\n     Beyond is desolation withering.\n     One hears within the hollow dreary space\n     Across the grove, made fresh by summer's grace,\n     The wind that ever is with mystic might\n     A spirit ripple of the Infinite.\n     The glass restored to frames to creak is made\n     By blustering wind that comes from neighboring glade.\n     Strange in this dream-like place, so drear and lone,\n     The guest expected should be living one!\n     The seven lights from seven arms make glow\n     Almost with life the staring eyes that show\n     On the dim frescoes--and along the walls\n     Is here and there a stool, or the light falls\n     O'er some long chest, with likeness to a tomb.\n     Yet was displayed amid the mournful gloom\n     Some copper vessels, and some crockery ware.\n     The door--as if it must, yet scarcely dare--\n     Had opened widely to the night's fresh air.\n\n     No voice is heard, for man has fled the place;\n     But Terror crouches in the corners' space,\n     And waits the coming guest. This banquet hall\n     Of Titans is so high, that he who shall\n     With wandering eye look up from beam to beam\n     Of the confused wild roof will haply seem\n     To wonder that the stars he sees not there.\n     Giants the spiders are, that weave with care\n     Their hideous webs, which float the joists amid,\n     Joists whose dark ends in griffins' jaws are hid.\n     The light is lurid, and the air like death,\n     And dark and foul. Even Night holds its breath\n     Awhile. One might suppose the door had fear\n     To move its double leaves--their noise to hear.\n\n     VIII.\n\n     WHAT MORE WAS TO BE SEEN.\n\n     But the great hall of generations dead\n     Has something more sepulchral and more dread\n     Than lurid glare from seven-branched chandelier\n     Or table lone with stately da\u00efs near--\n     Two rows of arches o'er a colonnade\n     With knights on horseback all in mail arrayed,\n     Each one disposed with pillar at his back\n     And to another vis-\u00e0-vis. Nor lack\n     The fittings all complete; in each right hand\n     A lance is seen; the armored horses stand\n     With chamfrons laced, and harness buckled sure;\n     The cuissarts' studs are by their clamps secure;\n     The dirks stand out upon the saddle-bow;\n     Even unto the horses' feet do flow\n     Caparisons,--the leather all well clasped,\n     The gorget and the spurs with bronze tongues hasped,\n     The shining long sword from the saddle hung,\n     The battle-axe across the back was flung.\n     Under the arm a trusty dagger rests,\n     Each spiked knee-piece its murderous power attests.\n     Feet press the stirrups--hands on bridle shown\n     Proclaim all ready, with the visors down,\n     And yet they stir not, nor is audible\n     A sound to make the sight less terrible.\n\n     Each monstrous horse a frontal horn doth bear,\n     If e'er the Prince of Darkness herdsman were,\n     These cattle black were his by surest right,\n     Like things but seen in horrid dreams of night.\n     The steeds are swathed in trappings manifold,\n     The armed knights are grave, and stern, and cold,\n     Terrific too; the clench'd fists seem to hold\n     Some frightful missive, which the phantom hands\n     Would show, if opened out at hell's commands.\n     The dusk exaggerates their giant size,\n     The shade is awed--the pillars coldly rise.\n     Oh, Night! why are these awful warriors here?\n\n     Horses and horsemen that make gazers fear\n     Are only empty armor. But erect\n     And haughty mien they all affect\n     And threatening air--though shades of iron still.\n     Are they strange larvae--these their statues ill?\n     No. They are dreams of horror clothed in brass,\n     Which from profoundest depths of evil pass\n     With futile aim to dare the Infinite!\n     Souls tremble at the silent spectre sight,\n     As if in this mysterious cavalcade\n     They saw the weird and mystic halt was made\n     Of them who at the coming dawn of day\n     Would fade, and from their vision pass away.\n     A stranger looking in, these masks to see,\n     Might deem from Death some mandate there might be\n     At times to burst the tombs--the dead to wear\n     A human shape, and mustering ranks appear\n     Of phantoms, each confronting other shade.\n\n     Grave-clothes are not more grim and sombre made\n     Than are these helms; the deaf and sealed-up graves\n     Are not more icy than these arms; the staves\n     Of hideous biers have not their joints more strong\n     Than are the joinings of these legs; the long\n     Scaled gauntlet fingers look like worms that shine,\n     And battle robes to shroud-like folds incline.\n     The heads are skull-like, and the stony feet\n     Seem for the charnel house but only meet.\n     The pikes have death's-heads carved, and seem to be\n     Too heavy; but the shapes defiantly\n     Sit proudly in the saddle--and perforce\n     The rider looks united to the horse!\n     The network of their mail doth clearly cross.\n     The Marquis' mortar beams near Ducal wreath,\n     And on the helm and gleaming shield beneath\n     Alternate triple pearls with leaves displayed\n     Of parsley, and the royal robes are made\n     So large that with the knightly harness they\n     Seem to o'ermaster palfreys every way.\n     To Rome the oldest armor might be traced,\n     And men and horses' armor interlaced\n     Blent horribly; the man and steed we feel\n     Made but one hydra with its scales of steel.\n     Yet is there history here. Each coat of mail\n     Is representant of some stirring tale.\n     Each delta-shaped escutcheon shines to show\n     A vision of the chief by it we know.\n     Here are the blood-stained Dukes' and Marquis' line,\n     Barbaric lords, who amid war's rapine\n     Bore gilded saints upon their banners still\n     Painted on fishes' skin with cunning skill.\n     Here Geth, who to the Slaves cried \"Onward go,\"\n     And Mundiaque and Ottocar--Plato\n     And Ladisl\u00e4us Kunne; and Welf who bore\n     These words upon his shield his foes before;\n     \"Nothing there is I fear.\" Otho blear-eyed,\n     Zultan and Nazamustus, and beside\n     The later Spignus, e'en to Spartibor\n     Of triple vision, and yet more and more\n     As if a pause at every age were made,\n     And Antaeus' fearful dynasty portrayed.\n\n     What do they here so rigid and erect?\n     What wait they for--and what do they expect?\n     Blindness fills up the helm 'neath iron brows;\n     Like sapless tree no soul the hero knows.\n     Darkness is now where eyes with flame were fraught,\n     And thrice-bored visor serves for mask of naught.\n     Of empty void is spectral giant made,\n     And each of these all-powerful knights displayed\n     Is only rind of pride and murderous sin;\n     Themselves are held the icy grave within.\n     Rust eats the casques enamoured once so much\n     Of death and daring--which knew kiss-like touch\n     Of banner--mistress so august and dear--\n     But not an arm can stir its hinges here;\n     Behold how mute are they whose threats were heard\n     Like savage roar--whose gnashing teeth and word\n     Deadened the clarion's tones; the helmets dread\n     Have not a sound, and all the armor spread,\n     The hauberks, that strong breathing seemed to sway,\n     Are stranded now in helplessness alway\n     To see the shadows, still prolonged, that seem\n     To take at night the image of a dream.\n\n     These two great files reach from the door afar\n     To where the table and the da\u00efs are,\n     Leaving between their fronts a narrow lane.\n     On the left side the Marquises maintain\n     Their place, but the right side the Dukes retain,\n     And till the roof, embattled by Spignus,\n     But worn by time that even that subdues,\n     Shall fall upon their heads, these forms will stand\n     The grades confronting--one on either hand.\n     While in advance beyond, with haughty head--\n     As if commander of this squadron dread--\n     All waiting signal of the Judgment Day,\n     In stone was seen in olden sculptors' way\n     Charlemagne the King, who on the earth had found\n     Only twelve knights to grace his Table Round.\n\n     The crests were an assembly of strange things,\n     Of horrors such as nightmare only brings.\n     Asps, and spread eagles without beak or feet,\n     Sirens and mermaids here and dragons meet,\n     And antlered stags and fabled unicorn,\n     And fearful things of monstrous fancy born.\n     Upon the rigid form of morion's sheen\n     Winged lions and the Cerberus are seen,\n     And serpents winged and finned; things made to fright\n     The timid foe, alone by sense of sight.\n     Some leaning forward and the others back,\n     They looked a growing forest that did lack\n     No form of terror; but these things of dread\n     That once on barons' helms the battle led\n     Beneath the giant banners, now are still,\n\n     As if they gaped and found the time but ill,\n     Wearied the ages passed so slowly by,\n     And that the gory dead no more did lie\n     Beneath their feet--pined for the battle-cry,\n     The trumpet's clash, the carnage and the strife,\n     Yawning to taste again their dreadful life.\n     Like tears upon the palfreys' muzzles were\n     The hard reflections of the metal there;\n     From out these spectres, ages past exhumed,\n     And as their shadows on the roof-beams loomed,\n     Cast by the trembling light, each figure wan\n     Seemed growing, and a monstrous shape to don,\n     So that the double range of horrors made\n     The darkened zenith clouds of blackest shade,\n     That shaped themselves to profiles terrible.\n\n     All motionless the coursers horrible,\n     That formed a legion lured by Death to war,\n     These men and horses masked, how dread they are!\n     Absorbed in shadows of the eternal shore,\n     Among the living all their tasks are o'er.\n     Silent, they seem all mystery to brave,\n     These sphinxes whom no beacon light can save\n     Upon the threshold of the gulf so near,\n     As if they faced the great enigma here;\n     Ready with hoofs, between the pillars blue\n     To strike out sparks, and combats to renew,\n     Choosing for battle-field the shades below,\n     Which they provoked by deeds we cannot know,\n     In that dark realm thought dares not to expound\n     False masks from heaven lowered to depths profound.\n\n     IX.\n\n     A NOISE ON THE FLOOR.\n\n     This is the scene on which now enters in\n     Eviradnus; and follows page Gasclin.\n\n     The outer walls were almost all decayed,\n     The door, for ancient Marquises once made--\n     Raised many steps above the courtyard near--\n     Commanded view of the horizon clear.\n     The forest looked a great gulf all around,\n     And on the rock of Corbus there were found\n     Secret and blood-stained precipices tall.\n     Duke Plato built the tower and banquet hall\n     Over great pits,--so was it Rumor said.\n     The flooring sounds 'neath Eviradnus' tread\n     Above abysses many.\n                          \"Page,\" said he,\n     \"Come here, your eyes than mine can better see,\n     For sight is woman-like and shuns the old;\n     Ah! he can see enough, when years are told,\n     Who backwards looks. But, boy, turn towards the glade\n     And tell me what you see.\"\n                                 The boy obeyed,\n     And leaned across the threshold, while the bright,\n     Full moon shed o'er the glade its white, pure light.\n\n     \"I see a horse and woman on it now,\"\n     Said Gasclin, \"and companions also show.\"\n     \"Who are they?\" asked the seeker of sublime\n     Adventures. \"Sir, I now can hear like chime\n     The sound of voices, and men's voices too,\n     Laughter and talk; two men there are in view,\n     Across the road the shadows clear I mark\n     Of horses three.\"\n                        \"Enough. Now, Gasclin, hark!\"\n     Exclaimed the knight, \"you must at once return\n     By other path than that which you discern,\n     So that you be not seen. At break of day\n     Bring back our horses fresh, and every way\n     Caparisoned; now leave me, boy, I say.\"\n     The page looked at his master like a son,\n     And said, \"Oh! if I might stay on,\n     For they are two.\"\n\n         \"Go--I suffice alone!\"\n\n     X.\n\n     EVIRADNUS MOTIONLESS.\n\n     And lone the hero is within the hall,\n     And nears the table where the glasses all\n     Show in profusion; all the vessels there,\n     Goblets and glasses gilt, or painted fair,\n     Are ranged for different wines with practised care.\n     He thirsts; the flagons tempt; but there must stay\n     One drop in emptied glass, and 'twould betray\n     The fact that some one living had been here.\n     Straight to the horses goes he, pauses near\n     That which is next the table shining bright,\n     Seizes the rider--plucks the phantom knight\n     To pieces--all in vain its panoply\n     And pallid shining to his practised eye;\n     Then he conveys the severed iron remains\n     To corner of the hall where darkness reigns;\n     Against the wall he lays the armor low\n     In dust and gloom like hero vanquished now--\n     But keeping pond'rous lance and shield so old,\n     Mounts to the empty saddle, and behold!\n     A statue Eviradnus has become,\n     Like to the others in their frigid home.\n     With visor down scarce breathing seemed maintained\n     Throughout the hall a death-like silence reigned.\n\n     XI.\n\n     A LITTLE MUSIC.\n\n     Listen! like hum froth unseen nests we hear\n     A mirthful buzz of voices coming near,\n     Of footsteps--laughter--from the trembling trees.\n     And now the thick-set forest all receives\n     A flood of moonlight--and there gently floats\n     The sound of a guitar of Inspruck; notes\n     Which blend with chimes--vibrating to the hand--\n     Of tiny bell--where sounds a grain of sand.\n     A man's voice mixes with the melody,\n     And vaguely melts to song in harmony.\n\n       \"If you like we'll dream a dream.\n         Let us mount on palfreys two;\n       Birds are singing,--let it seem\n         You lure me--and I take you.\n\n       \"Let us start--'tis eve, you see,\n          I'm thy master and thy prey.\n       My bright steed shall pleasure be;\n         Yours, it shall be love, I say.\n\n       \"Journeying leisurely we go,\n         We will make our steeds touch heads,\n       Kiss for fodder,--and we so\n         Satisfy our horses' needs.\n\n       \"Come! the two delusive things\n         Stamp impatiently it seems,\n       Yours has heavenward soaring wings,\n         Mine is of the land of dreams.\n\n       \"What's our baggage? only vows,\n         Happiness, and all our care,\n       And the flower that sweetly shows\n         Nestling lightly in your hair.\n\n       \"Come, the oaks all dark appear,\n         Twilight now will soon depart,\n       Railing sparrows laugh to hear\n         Chains thou puttest round my heart.\n\n       \"Not my fault 'twill surely be\n         If the hills should vocal prove,\n       And the trees when us they see,\n         All should murmur--let us love!\n\n       \"Oh, be gentle!--I am dazed,\n        See the dew is on the grass,\n       Wakened butterflies amazed\n         Follow thee as on we pass.\n\n       \"Envious night-birds open wide\n         Their round eyes to gaze awhile,\n       Nymphs that lean their urns beside\n         From their grottoes softly smile,\n\n       \"And exclaim, by fancy stirred,\n         'Hero and Leander they;\n       We in listening for a word\n         Let our water fall away.'\n\n       \"Let us journey Austrian way,\n         With the daybreak on our brow;\n       I be great, and you I say\n         Rich, because we love shall know.\n\n       \"Let us over countries rove,\n         On our charming steeds content,\n       In the azure light of love,\n         And its sweet bewilderment.\n\n       \"For the charges at our inn,\n         You with maiden smiles shall pay;\n       I the landlord's heart will win\n         In a scholar's pleasant way.\n\n       \"You, great lady--and I, Count--\n        Come, my heart has opened quite,\n       We this tale will still recount,\n         To the stars that shine at night.\"\n\n     The melody went on some moments more\n     Among the trees the calm moon glistened o'er,\n     Then trembled and was hushed; the voice's thrill\n     Stopped like alighting birds, and all was still.\n\n     XII.\n\n     GREAT JOSS AND LITTLE ZENO.\n\n     Quite suddenly there showed across the door,\n     Three heads which all a festive aspect wore.\n     Two men were there; and, dressed in cloth of gold,\n     A woman. Of the men one might have told\n     Some thirty years, the other younger seemed,\n     Was tall and fair, and from his shoulder gleamed\n     A gay guitar with ivy leaves enlaced.\n     The other man was dark, but pallid-faced\n     And small. At the first glance they seemed to be\n     But made of perfume and frivolity.\n     Handsome they were, but through their comely mien\n     A grinning demon might be clearly seen.\n     April has flowers where lurk the slugs between.\n\n     \"Big Joss and little Zeno, pray come here;\n     Look now--how dreadful! can I help but fear!\"\n     Madame Mahaud was speaker. Moonlight there\n     Caressingly enhanced her beauty rare,\n     Making it shine and tremble, as if she\n     So soft and gentle were of things that be\n     Of air created, and are brought and ta'en\n     By heavenly flashes. Now, she spoke again\n     \"Certes, 'tis heavy purchase of a throne,\n     To pass the night here utterly alone.\n     Had you not slyly come to guard me now,\n     I should have died of fright outright I know.\"\n     The moonbeams through the open door did fall,\n     And shine upon the figure next the wall.\n\n     Said Zeno, \"If I played the Marquis part,\n     I'd send this rubbish to the auction mart;\n     Out of the heap should come the finest wine,\n     Pleasure and gala-f\u00eates, were it all mine.\"\n     And then with scornful hand he touched the thing,\n     And made the metal like a soul's cry ring.\n     He laughed--the gauntlet trembled at his stroke.\n     \"Let rest my ancestors\"--'twas Mahaud spoke;\n     Then murmuring added she, \"For you are much\n     Too small their noble armor here to touch.\"\n\n     And Zeno paled, but Joss with laugh exclaimed,\n     \"Why, all these good black men so grandly named\n     Are only nests for mice. By Jove, although\n     They lifelike look and terrible, we know\n     What is within; just listen, and you'll hear\n     The vermins' gnawing teeth, yet 'twould appear\n     These figures once were proudly named Otho,\n     And Ottocar, and Bela, and Plato.\n     Alas! the end's not pleasant--puts one out;\n     To have been kings and dukes--made mighty rout--\n     Colossal heroes filling tombs with slain,\n     And, Madame, this to only now remain;\n     A peaceful nibbling rat to calmly pierce\n     A prince's noble armor proud and fierce.\"\n\n     \"Sing, if you will--but do not speak so loud;\n     Besides, such things as these,\" said fair Mahaud,\n     \"In your condition are not understood.\"\n     \"Well said,\" made answer Zeno, \"'tis a place\n     Of wonders--I see serpents, and can trace\n     Vampires, and monsters swarming, that arise\n     In mist, through chinks, to meet the gazer's eyes.\"\n\n     Then Mahaud shuddered, and she said: \"The wine\n     The Abb\u00e9 made me drink as task of mine,\n     Will soon enwrap me in the soundest sleep--\n     Swear not to leave me--that you here will keep.\"\n     \"I swear,\" cried Joss, and Zeno, \"I also;\n     But now at once to supper let us go.\"\n\n     XIII.\n\n     THEY SUP.\n\n     With laugh and song they to the table went.\n     Said Mahaud gayly: \"It is my intent\n     To make Joss chamberlain. Zeno shall be\n     A constable supreme of high degree.\"\n     All three were joyous, and were fair to see.\n     Joss ate--and Zeno drank; on stools the pair,\n     With Mahaud musing in the regal chair.\n     The sound of separate leaf we do not note--\n     And so their babble seemed to idly float,\n     And leave no thought behind. Now and again\n     Joss his guitar made trill with plaintive strain\n     Or Tyrolean air; and lively tales they told\n     Mingled with mirth all free, and frank, and bold.\n     Said Mahaud: \"Do you know how fortunate\n     You are?\" \"Yes, we are young at any rate--\n     Lovers half crazy--this is truth at least.\"\n     \"And more, for you know Latin like a priest,\n     And Joss sings well.\"\n                          \"Ah, yes, our master true,\n     Yields us these gifts beyond the measure due.\"\n     \"Your master!--who is he?\" Mahaud exclaimed.\n     \"Satan, we say--but Sin you'd think him named,\"\n     Said Zeno, veiling words in raillery.\n     \"Do not laugh thus,\" she said with dignity;\n     \"Peace, Zeno. Joss, you speak, my chamberlain.\"\n     \"Madame, Viridis, Countess of Milan,\n     Was deemed superb; Diana on the mount\n     Dazzled the shepherd boy; ever we count\n     The Isabel of Saxony so fair,\n     And Cleopatra's beauty all so rare--\n     Aspasia's, too, that must with theirs compare--\n     That praise of them no fitting language hath.\n     Divine was Rhodope--and Venus' wrath\n     Was such at Erylesis' perfect throat,\n     She dragged her to the forge where Vulcan smote\n     Her beauty on his anvil. Well, as much\n     As star transcends a sequin, and just such\n     As temple is to rubbish-heap, I say,\n     You do eclipse their beauty every way.\n     Those airy sprites that from the azure smile,\n     Peris and elfs the while they men beguile,\n     Have brows less youthful pure than yours; besides\n     Dishevelled they whose shaded beauty hides\n     In clouds.\"\n                \"Flatt'rer,\" said Mahaud, \"you but sing\n     Too well.\"\n                Then Joss more homage sought to bring;\n     \"If I were angel under heav'n,\" said he,\n     \"Or girl or demon, I would seek to be\n     By you instructed in all art and grace,\n     And as in school but take a scholar's place.\n     Highness, you are a fairy bright, whose hand\n     For sceptre vile gave up your proper wand.\"\n     Fair Mahaud mused--then said, \"Be silent now;\n     You seem to watch me; little 'tis I know,\n     Only that from Bohemia Joss doth come,\n     And that in Poland Zeno hath his home.\n     But you amuse me; I am rich, you poor--\n     What boon shall I confer and make secure?\n     What gift? ask of me, poets, what you will\n     And I will grant it--promise to fulfil.\"\n     \"A kiss,\" said Joss.\n                         \"A kiss!\" and anger fraught\n     Amazed at minstrel having such a thought--\n     While flush of indignation warmed her cheek.\n     \"You do forget to whom it is you speak,\"\n     She cried.\n               \"Had I not known your high degree,\n     Should I have asked this royal boon,\" said he,\n     \"Obtained or given, a kiss must ever be.\n     No gift like king's--no kiss like that of queen!\"\n     Queen! And on Mahaud's face a smile was seen.\n\n     XIV.\n\n     AFTER SUPPER.\n\n     But now the potion proved its subtle power,\n     And Mahaud's heavy eyelids 'gan to lower.\n     Zeno, with finger on his lip, looked on--\n     Her head next drooped, and consciousness was gone.\n     Smiling she slept, serene and very fair,\n     He took her hand, which fell all unaware.\n\n     \"She sleeps,\" said Zeno, \"now let chance or fate\n     Decide for us which has the marquisate,\n     And which the girl.\"\n\n                         Upon their faces now\n     A hungry tiger's look began to show.\n     \"My brother, let us speak like men of sense,\"\n     Said Joss; \"while Mahaud dreams in innocence,\n     We grasp all here--and hold the foolish thing--\n     Our Friend below to us success will bring.\n     He keeps his word; 'tis thanks to him I say,\n     No awkward chance has marred our plans to-day.\n     All has succeeded--now no human power\n     Can take from us this woman and her dower.\n     Let us conclude. To wrangle and to fight\n     For just a yes or no, or to prove right\n     The Arian doctrines, all the time the Pope\n     Laughs in his sleeve at you--or with the hope\n     Some blue-eyed damsel with a tender skin\n     And milkwhite dainty hands by force to win--\n     This might be well in days when men bore loss\n     And fought for Latin or Byzantine Cross;\n     When Jack and Rudolf did like fools contend,\n     And for a simple wench their valor spend--\n     When Pepin held a synod at Leptine,\n     And times than now were much less wise and fine.\n     We do no longer heap up quarrels thus,\n     But better know how projects to discuss.\n     Have you the needful dice?\"\n\n                                \"Yes, here they wait\n     For us.\"\n\n             \"Who wins shall have the Marquisate;\n     Loser, the girl.\"\n\n                      \"Agreed.\"\n\n                               \"A noise I hear?\"\n     \"Only the wind that sounds like some one near--\n     Are you afraid?\" said Zeno.\n\n                                \"Naught I fear\n     Save fasting--and that solid earth should gape.\n     Let's throw and fate decide--ere time escape.\"\n     Then rolled the dice.\n\n                          \"'Tis four.\"\n\n                                      'Twas Joss to throw.\n     \"Six!--and I neatly win, you see; and lo!\n     At bottom of this box I've found Lusace,\n     And henceforth my orchestra will have place;\n     To it they'll dance. Taxes I'll raise, and they\n     In dread of rope and forfeit well will pay;\n     Brass trumpet-calls shall be my flutes that lead,\n     Where gibbets rise the imposts grow and spread.\"\n\n     Said Zeno, \"I've the girl and so is best,\"\n     \"She's beautiful,\" said Joss.\n\n                                  \"Yes, 'tis confess'd.\"\n     \"What shall you do with her?\" asked Joss.\n\n                                              \"I know.\n     Make her a corpse,\" said Zeno; \"marked you how\n     The jade insulted me just now!

Brother, this woman hath\n     As marchioness with absurdity set forth\n     To rule o'er frontier bulwarks of the north.\n     In any case to us a danger she,\n     And having stupidly insulted me\n     'Tis needful that she die. To blurt all out--\n     I know that you desire her; without doubt\n     The flame that rages in my heart warms yours;\n     To carry out these subtle plans of ours,\n     We have become as gypsies near this doll,\n     You as her page--I dotard to control--\n     Pretended gallants changed to lovers now.\n     So, brother, this being fact for us to know\n     Sooner or later, 'gainst our best intent\n     About her we should quarrel. Evident\n     Is it our compact would be broken through.\n     There is one only thing for us to do,\n     And that is, kill her.\"\n\n                            \"Logic very clear,\"\n     Said musing Joss, \"but what of blood shed here?\"\n     Then Zeno stooped and lifted from the ground\n     An edge of carpet--groped until he found\n     A ring, which, pulled, an opening did disclose,\n     With deep abyss beneath; from it there rose\n     The odor rank of crime. Joss walked to see\n     While Zeno pointed to it silently.\n     But eyes met eyes, and Joss, well pleased, was fain\n     By nod of head to make approval plain.\n\n     XV.\n\n     THE OUBLIETTES.\n\n     If sulphurous light had shone from this vile well\n     One might have said it was a mouth of hell,\n     So large the trap that by some sudden blow\n     A man might backward fall and sink below.\n     Who looked could see a harrow's threatening teeth,\n     But lost in night was everything beneath.\n     Partitions blood-stained have a reddened smear,\n     And Terror unrelieved is master here.\n     One feels the place has secret histories\n     Replete with dreadful murderous mysteries,\n     And that this sepulchre, forgot to-day,\n     Is home of trailing ghosts that grope their way\n     Along the walls where spectre reptiles crawl.\n     \"Our fathers fashioned for us after all\n     Some useful things,\" said Joss; then Zeno spoke:\n     \"I know what Corbus hides beneath its cloak,\n     I and the osprey know the castle old,\n     And what in bygone times the justice bold.\"\n\n     \"And are you sure that Mahaud will not wake?\"\n     \"Her eyes are closed as now my fist I make;\n     She is in mystic and unearthly sleep;\n     The potion still its power o'er her must keep.\"\n     \"But she will surely wake at break of day?\"\n     \"In darkness.\"\n\n                   \"What will all the courtiers say\n     When in the place of her they find two men?\"\n     \"To them we will declare ourselves--and then\n     They at our feet will fall.\"\n\n                                 \"Where leads this hole?\"\n     \"To where the crow makes feast and torrents roll\n     To desolation.

They nearer move apace;\n     And Mahaud soundly sleeps as in a bed.\n     \"To work.\"\n\n               Joss seizes her and holds her head\n     Supporting her beneath her arms, in his;\n     And then he dared to plant a monstrous kiss\n     Upon her rosy lips,--while Zeno bent\n     Before the massive chair, and with intent\n     Her robe disordered as he raised her feet;\n     Her dainty ankles thus their gaze to meet.\n     And while the mystic sleep was all profound,\n     The pit gaped wide like grave in burial ground.\n\n     XVI.\n\n     WHAT THEY ATTEMPT BECOMES DIFFICULT.\n\n     Bearing the sleeping Mahaud they moved now\n     Silent and bent with heavy step and slow.\n     Zeno faced darkness--Joss turned towards the light--\n     So that the hall to Joss was quite in sight.\n     Sudden he stopped--and Zeno, \"What now!\" called,\n     But Joss replied not, though he seemed appalled,\n     And made a sign to Zeno, who with speed\n     Looked back. Then seemed they changed to stone indeed.\n     For both perceived that in the vaulted hall\n     One of the grand old knights ranged by the wall\n     Descended from his horse. Like phantom he\n     Moved with a horrible tranquillity.\n     Masked by his helm towards them he came; his tread\n     Made the floor tremble--and one might have said\n     A spirit of th' abyss was here; between\n     Them and the pit he came--a barrier seen;\n     Then said, with sword in hand and visor down,\n     In measured tones that had sepulchral grown\n     As tolling bell, \"Stop, Sigismond, and you,\n     King Ladisl\u00e4us;\" at those words, though few,\n     They dropped the Marchioness, and in such a way\n     That at their feet like rigid corpse she lay.\n\n     The deep voice speaking from the visor's grate\n     Proceeded--while the two in abject state\n     Cowered low. Joss paled, by gloom and dread o'ercast,\n     And Zeno trembled like a yielding mast.\n     \"You two who listen now must recollect\n     The compact all your fellow-men suspect.\n     'Tis this: 'I, Satan, god of darkened sphere,\n     The king of gloom and winds that bring things drear,\n     Alliance make with my two brothers dear,\n     The Emperor Sigismond and Polish King\n     Named Ladisl\u00e4us. I to surely bring\n     Aid and protection to them both alway,\n     And never to absent myself or say\n     I'm weary. And yet more--I, being lord\n     Of sea and land, to Sigismond award\n     The earth; to Ladisl\u00e4us all the sea.\n     With this condition that they yield to me\n     When I the forfeit claim--the King his head,\n     But shall the Emperor give his soul instead.'\"\n\n     Said Joss, \"Is't he?--Spectre with flashing eyes,\n     And art thou Satan come to us surprise?\"\n     \"Much less am I and yet much more.\n     Oh, kings of crimes and plots! your day is o'er,\n     But I your lives will only take to-day;\n     Beneath the talons black your souls let stay\n     To wrestle still.\"\n\n                        The pair looked stupefied\n     And crushed. Exchanging looks 'twas Zeno cried,\n     Speaking to Joss, \"Now who--who can it be?\"\n     Joss stammered, \"Yes, no refuge can I see;\n     The doom is on us. But oh, spectre! say\n     Who are you?\"\n\n                  \"I'm the judge.\"\n\n                                  \"Then mercy, pray.\"\n     The voice replied: \"God guides His chosen hand\n     To be th' Avenger in your path to stand.\n     Your hour has sounded, nothing now indeed\n     Can change for you the destiny decreed,\n     Irrevocable quite. Yes, I looked on.\n     Ah! little did you think that any one\n     To this unwholesome gloom could knowledge bring\n     That Joss a kaiser was, and Zeno king.\n     You spoke just now--but why?--too late to plead.\n     The forfeit's due and hope should all be dead.\n     Incurables! For you I am the grave.\n     Oh, miserable men! that naught can save.\n     Yes, Sigismond a kaiser is, and you\n     A king, O Ladisl\u00e4us!--it is true.\n     You thought of God but as a wheel to roll\n     Your chariot on; you who have king's control\n     O'er Poland and its many towns so strong.\n     You, Milan's Duke, to whom at once belong\n     The gold and iron crowns. You, Emperor made\n     By Rome, a son of Hercules 'tis said;\n     And you of Spartibor. And your two crowns\n     Are shining lights; and yet your shadow frowns\n     From every mountain land to trembling sea.\n     You are at giddy heights twin powers to be\n     A glory and a force for all that's great--\n     But 'neath the purple canopy of state,\n     Th' expanding and triumphant arch you prize,\n     'Neath royal power that sacred veils disguise,\n     Beneath your crowns of pearls and jewelled stars,\n     Beneath your exploits terrible and wars,\n     You, Sigismond, have but a monster been,\n     And, Ladisl\u00e4us, you are scoundrel seen.\n     Oh, degradation of the sceptre's might\n     And swords--when Justice has a hand like night,\n     Foul and polluted; and before this thing,\n     This hydra, do the Temple's hinges swing--\n     The throne becomes the haunt of all things base\n     Oh, age of infamy and foul disgrace!\n     Oh, starry heavens looking on the shame,\n     No brow but reddens with resentful flame--\n     And yet the silent people do not stir!\n     Oh, million arms! what things do you deter--\n     Poor sheep, whom vermin-majesties devour,\n     Have you not nails with strong desiring power\n     To rend these royalties, that you so cower?\n     But two are taken,--such as will amaze\n     E'en hell itself, when it on them shall gaze.\n     Ah, Sigismond and Ladisl\u00e4us, you\n     Were once triumphant, splendid to the view,\n     Stifling with your prosperity--but now\n     The hour of retribution lays you low.\n     Ah, do the vulture and the crocodile\n     Shed tears! At such a sight I fain must smile.\n     It seems to me 'tis very good sometimes\n     That princes, conquerors stained with bandits' crimes,\n     Sparkling with splendor, wearing crowns of gold,\n     Should know the deadly sweat endured of old,\n     That of Jehoshaphat; should sob and fear,\n     And after crime th' unclean be brought to bear.\n     'Tis well--God rules--and thus it is that I\n     These masters of the world can make to lie\n     In ashes at my feet. And this was he\n     Who reigned--and this a Caesar known to be!\n     In truth, my old heart aches with very shame\n     To see such cravens with such noble name.\n     But let us finish--what has just passed here\n     Demands thick shrouding, and the time is near.\n     Th' accursed dice that rolled at Calvary\n     You rolled a woman's murder to decree\n     It was a dark disastrous game to play;\n     But not for me a moral to essay.\n     This moment to the misty grave is due,\n     And far too vile and little human you\n     To see your evil ways. Your fingers lack\n     The human power your shocking deeds to track.\n     What use in darkness mirror to uphold?\n     What use your doings to be now retold?\n     Drink of the darkness--greedy of the ill\n     To which from habit you're attracted still,\n     Not recognizing in the draught you take\n     The stench that your atrocities must make.\n     I only tell you that this burdened age\n     Tires of your Highnesses, that soil its page,\n     And of your villanies--and this is why\n     You now must swell the stream that passes by\n     Of refuse filth. Oh, horrid scene to show\n     Of these young men and that young girl just now!\n     Oh! can you really be of human kind\n     Breathing pure air of heaven? Do we find\n     That you are men? Oh, no! for when you laid\n     Foul lips upon the mouth of sleeping maid,\n     You seemed but ghouls that had come furtively\n     From out the tombs; only a horrid lie\n     Your human shape; of some strange frightful beast\n     You have the soul. To darkness I at least\n     Remit you now. Oh, murderer Sigismond\n     And Ladisl\u00e4us pirate, both beyond\n     Release--two demons that have broken ban!\n     Therefore 'tis time their empire over man\n     And converse with the living, should be o'er;\n     Tyrants, behold your tomb your eyes before;\n     Vampires and dogs, your sepulchre is here.\n     Enter.\"\n\n                 He pointed to the gulf so near.\n     All terrified upon their knees they fell.\n     \"Oh! take us not in your dread realm to dwell,\"\n     Said Sigismond. \"But, phantom! do us tell\n     What thou wouldst have from us--we will obey.\n     Oh, mercy!--'tis for mercy now we pray.\"\n     \"Behold us at your feet, oh, spectre dread!\"\n     And no old crone in feebler voice could plead\n     Than Ladisl\u00e4us did.\n\n                          But not a word\n     Said now the figure motionless, with sword\n     In hand. This sovereign soul seemed to commune\n     With self beneath his metal sheath; yet soon\n     And suddenly, with tranquil voice said he,\n     \"Princes, your craven spirit wearies me.\n     No phantom--only man am I. Arise!\n     I like not to be dreaded otherwise\n     Than with the fear to which I'm used; know me,\n     For it is Eviradnus that you see!\"\n\n     XVII.\n\n     THE CLUB.\n\n     As from the mist a noble pine we tell\n     Grown old upon the heights of Appenzel,\n     When morning freshness breathes round all the wood,\n     So Eviradnus now before them stood,\n     Opening his visor, which at once revealed\n     The snowy beard it had so well concealed.\n     Thin Sigismond was still as dog at gaze,\n     But Ladisl\u00e4us leaped, and howl did raise,\n     And laughed and gnashed his teeth, till, like a cloud\n     That sudden bursts, his rage was all avowed.\n     \"'Tis but an old man after all!\" he cried.\n\n     Then the great knight, who looked at both, replied,\n     \"Oh, kings! an old man of my time can cope\n     With two much younger ones of yours, I hope.\n     To mortal combat I defy you both\n     Singly; or, if you will, I'm nothing loth\n     With two together to contend; choose here\n     From out the heap what weapon shall appear\n     Most fit. As you no cuirass wear, I see,\n     I will take off my own, for all must be\n     In order perfect--e'en your punishment.\"\n\n     Then Eviradnus, true to his intent,\n     Stripped to his Utrecht jerkin; but the while\n     He calmly had disarmed--with dexterous guile\n     Had Ladisl\u00e4us seized a knife that lay\n     Upon the damask cloth, and slipped away\n     His shoes; then barefoot, swiftly, silently\n     He crept behind the knight, with arm held high.\n     But Eviradnus was of all aware,\n     And turned upon the murderous weapon there,\n     And twisted it away; then in a trice\n     His strong colossal hand grasped like a vice\n     The neck of Ladisl\u00e4us, who the blade\n     Now dropped; over his eyes a misty shade\n     Showed that the royal dwarf was near to death.\n\n     \"Traitor!\" said Eviradnus in his wrath,\n     \"I rather should have hewn your limbs away,\n     And left you crawling on your stumps, I say,--\n     But now die fast.\"\n\n                        Ghastly, with starting eyes,\n     The King without a cry or struggle dies.\n     One dead--but lo! the other stands bold-faced,\n     Defiant; for the knight, when he unlaced\n     His cuirass, had his trusty sword laid down,\n     And Sigismond now grasps it as his own.\n     The monster-youth laughed at the silv'ry beard,\n     And, sword in hand, a murderer glad appeared.\n     Crossing his arms, he cried, \"'Tis my turn now!\"\n     And the black mounted knights in solemn row\n     Were judges of the strife. Before them lay\n     The sleeping Mahaud--and not far away\n     The fatal pit, near which the champion knight\n     With evil Emperor must contend for right,\n     Though weaponless he was. And yawned the pit\n     Expectant which should be engulfed in it.\n\n     \"Now we shall see for whom this ready grave,\"\n     Said Sigismond, \"you dog, whom naught can save!\"\n     Aware was Eviradnus that if he\n     Turned for a blade unto the armory,\n     He would be instant pierced--what can he do?\n     The moment is for him supreme. But, lo!\n     He glances now at Ladisl\u00e4us dead,\n     And with a smile triumphant and yet dread,\n     And air of lion caged to whom is shown\n     Some loophole of escape, he bends him down.\n\n     \"Ha! ha! no other club than this I need!\"\n     He cried, as seizing in his hands with speed\n     The dead King's heels, the body lifted high,\n     Then to the frightened Emperor he came nigh,\n     And made him shake with horror and with fear,\n     The weapon all so ghastly did appear.\n     The head became the stone to this strange sling,\n     Of which the body was the potent string;\n     And while 'twas brandished in a deadly way,\n     The dislocated arms made monstrous play\n     With hideous gestures, as now upside down\n     The bludgeon corpse a giant force had grown.\n     \"'Tis well!\" said Eviradnus, and he cried,\n     \"Arrange between yourselves, you two allied;\n     If hell-fire were extinguished, surely it\n     By such a contest might be all relit;\n     From kindling spark struck out from dead King's brow,\n     Batt'ring to death a living Emperor now.\"\n\n     And Sigismond, thus met and horrified,\n     Recoiled to near the unseen opening wide;\n     The human club was raised, and struck again * * *\n     And Eviradnus did alone remain\n     All empty-handed--but he heard the sound\n     Of spectres two falling to depths profound;\n     Then, stooping o'er the pit, he gazed below,\n     And, as half-dreaming now, he murmured low,\n     \"Tiger and jackal meet their portion here,\n     'Tis well together they should disappear!\"\n\n     XVIII.\n\n     DAYBREAK.\n\n     Then lifts he Mahaud to the ducal chair,\n     And shuts the trap with noiseless, gentle care;\n     And puts in order everything around,\n     So that, on waking, naught should her astound.\n\n     \"No drop of blood the thing has cost,\" mused he,\n     \"And that is best indeed.\"\n\n                                 But suddenly\n     Some distant bells clang out. The mountains gray\n     Have scarlet tips, proclaiming dawning day;\n     The hamlets are astir, and crowds come out--\n     Bearing fresh branches of the broom--about\n     To seek their Lady, who herself awakes\n     Rosy as morn, just when the morning breaks;\n     Half-dreaming still, she ponders, can it be\n     Some mystic change has passed, for her to see\n     One old man in the place of two quite young!\n     Her wondering eyes search carefully and long.\n     It may be she regrets the change: meanwhile,\n     The valiant knight salutes her with a smile,\n     And then approaching her with friendly mien,\n     Says, \"Madam, has your sleep all pleasant been?\"", "THE SOUDAN, THE SPHINXES, THE CUP, THE LAMP": "     _(\"Zim-Zizimi, Soudan d'\u00c9gypte.\")_\n\n\n     Zim Zizimi--(of the Soudan of burnt Egypt,\n       The Commander of Believers, a Bashaw\n     Whose very robes were from Asia's greatest stript,\n       More powerful than any lion with resistless paw)\n     A master weighed on by his immense splendor--\n       Once had a dream when he was at his evening feast,\n     When the broad table smoked like a perfumed censer,\n       And its grateful odors the appetite increased.\n     The banquet was outspread in a hall, high as vast,\n       With pillars painted, and with ceiling bright with gold,\n     Upreared by Zim's ancestors in the days long past,\n       And added to till now worth a sum untold.\n     Howe'er rich no rarity was absent, it seemed,\n       Fruit blushed upon the side-boards, groaning 'neath rich meats,\n     With all the dainties palate ever dreamed\n       In lavishness to waste--for dwellers in the streets\n     Of cities, whether Troy, or Tyre, or Ispahan,\n       Consume, in point of cost, food at a single meal\n     Much less than what is spread before this crowned man---\n       Who rules his couchant nation with a rod of steel,\n     And whose servitors' chiefest arts it was to squeeze\n       The world's full teats into his royal helpless mouth.\n     Each hard-sought dainty that never failed to please,\n       All delicacies, wines, from east, west, north or south,\n     Are plenty here--for Sultan Zizimi drinks wine\n       In its variety, trying to find what never sates.\n     Laughs at the holy writings and the text divine,\n       O'er which the humble dervish prays and venerates.\n     There is a common saying which holds often good:\n       That cruel is he who is sparing in his cups.\n     That they are such as are most thirsty of man's blood--\n       Yet he will see a slave beheaded whilst he sups.\n     But be this as it all may, glory gilds his reign,\n       He has overrun Africa, the old and black;\n     Asia as well--holding them both beneath a rain\n       Of bloody drops from scaffold, pyre, the stake, or rack,\n     To leave his empire's confines, one must run a race\n       Far past the river Baxtile southward; in the north,\n     To the rude, rocky, barren land of Thrace,\n       Yet near enough to shudder when great Zim is wroth.\n     Conquering in every field, he finds delight\n       In battle-storms; his music is the shout of camps.\n     On seeing him the eagle speeds away in fright,\n       Whilst hid 'mong rocks, the grisly wolf its victim champs.\n     Mysore's as well as Agra's rajah is his kin;\n       The great sheiks of the arid sands confess him lord;\n     Omar, who vaunting cried: \"Through me doth Allah win!\"\n       Was of his blood--a dreaded line of fire and sword.\n     The waters of Nagain, sands of Sahara warm,\n       The Atlas and the Caucasus, snow-capped and lone,\n     Mecca, Marcatta, these were massed in part to form\n       A portion of the giant shadow of Zim's throne.\n     Before his might, to theirs, as hardest rock to dust,\n       There have recoiled a horde of savage, warlike chiefs,\n     Who have been into Afric's fiery furnace thrust--\n       Its scorching heat to his rage greatest of reliefs.\n     There is no being but fears Zim;

He once was--no longer is--enough,\n     Crowned Time, whose seat is on a ruined mass,\n     Holds, and aye turns, a strange sand in his glass,\n     A sand scraped from the mould, brushed from the shroud\n     Of all passed things, mean, great, lowly, or proud.\n     Thus meting with the ashes of the dead\n     How hours of the living have quickly fled.\n     The sand runs, monarchs! the clepsydra weeps.\n     Wherefore?

The place is filled with fog like lead,\n     Which clammily has settled on the frame\n     Of her who was a burning, dazzling flame\n     To all mankind--who durst not lift their gaze,\n     And meet the brightness of her beauty's rays.\n     Her teeth were pearls, her breath a rare perfume.\n     Men died with love on entering her room.\n     Poised 'twixt the world and her--acme of joys!\n     Antony took her of the double choice.\n     The ice-cold heart that passion seldom warms,\n     Would find heat torrid in that queen's soft arms.\n     She won without a single woman's wile,\n     Illumining the earth with peerless smile.\n     Come in!--but muffle closely up your face,\n     No grateful scents have ta'en sweet odors' place.\n\n     THE TENTH SPHINX.\n\n     What did the greatest king that e'er earth bore,\n     Sennacherib? No matter--he's no more!\n     What were the words Sardanapalus said?\n     Who cares to hear--that ruler long is dead.\n\n     The Soudan, turning pale, stared at the TEN aghast.\n       \"Before to-morrow's night,\" he said, \"in dust to rest,\n     These walls with croaking images shall be downcast;\n       I will not have fiends speak when angels are addressed.\"\n     But while Zim at the Sphinxes clenched his hand and shook,\n       The cup in which it seems the rich wine sweetly breathes,\n     The cup with jewels sparkling, met his lowered look,\n       Dwelling on the rim which the rippling wine enwreathes.\n     \"Ha! You!\" Zim cried, \"have often cleared my heated head\n       Of heavy thoughts which your great lord have come to seek\n     And torture with their pain and weight like molten lead.\n       Let us two--power, I--you, wine--together speak.\"\n\n     THE CUP.\n\n     \"Phur,\" spoke the Cup, \"O king, dwelt as Day's god,\n     Ruled Alexandria with sword and rod.\n     He from his people drew force after force,\n     Leaving in ev'ry clime an army's corse.\n     But what gained he by having, like the sea,\n     Flooded with human waves to enslave the free?\n     Where lies the good in having been the chief\n     In conquering, to cause a nation's grief?\n     Darius, Assar-addon, Hamilcar;\n     Who have led men in legions out to war,\n     Or have o'er Time's shade cast rays from their seat,\n     Or throngs in worship made their name repeat,\n     These were, but all the cup of life have drank;\n     Rising 'midst clamor, they in stillness sank.\n     Death's dart beat down the sword--the kings high reared,\n     Were brought full low--judges, like culprits, feared.\n     The body--when the soul had ceased its sway--\n     Was placed where earth upon it heavy lay,\n     While seek the mouldering bones rare oils anoint\n     Claw of tree's root and tooth of rocky point.\n     Weeds thrive on them who made the world a mart\n     Of human flesh, plants force their joints apart.\n     No deed of eminence the greatest saves,\n     And of mausoleums make panthers caves.\"\n\n     The Cup, Zim, in his fury, dashed upon the floor,\n       Crying aloud for lights.
