{"CRITICS AND CONNOISSEURS": "There is a great amount of poetry in unconscious \n    fastidiousness.  Certain Ming \n        products, imperial floor coverings of coach- \n    wheel yellow, are well enough in their way but I have seen something \n            that I like better--a \n                mere childish attempt to make an imperfectly bal- \n                        lasted animal stand up, \n                similar determination to make a pup \n                    eat his meat from the plate.\n\nI remember a swan under the willows of Oxford, \n    with flamingo-colored, maple- \n        leaflike feet.  It reconnoitered like a battle- \n    ship.  Disbelief and conscious fastidiousness were \n            ingredients in its \n                disinclination to move.  Finally its hardihood was \n                        not proof against its \n                proclivity to more fully appreciate such bits \n                    of food as the stream\n\nbore counter to it; it made away with what I gave it \n    to eat.  I have seen this swan and \n        I have seen you; I have seen ambition without \n    understanding it in a variety of forms.  Happening to stand \n            by an ant-hill, I have \n                seen a fastidious ant carrying a stick north, south, \n                        east, west, till it turned on \n                itself, struck out from the flower bed into the lawn, \n                    and returned to the point\n\nFrom which it had started.  Then abandoning the stick as \n    useless and overtaxing its \n        jaws with a particle of whitewash--pill-like but \n    heavy--it again went throught the same course of procedure. \n                        What is \n            there in being able \n                to say that one has dominated the stream in an attitude of \n                        self-defense; \n                in proving that one has had the experience \n                    of carrying a stick?", "THE FISH": "wade\nthrough black jade.\n       Of the crow-blue mussel-shells, one keeps\n       adjusting the ash-heaps;\n              opening and shutting itself like\n\nan\ninjured fan.\n       The barnacles which encrust the side\n       of the wave, cannot hide\n              there for the submerged shafts of the\n\nsun,\nsplit like spun\n       glass, move themselves with spotlight swiftness\n       into the crevices\u2014\n              in and out, illuminating\n\nthe\nturquoise sea\n       of bodies. The water drives a wedge\n       of iron through the iron edge\n              of the cliff; whereupon the stars,\n\npink\nrice-grains, ink-\n       bespattered jelly fish, crabs like green\n       lilies, and submarine\n              toadstools, slide each on the other.\n\nAll\nexternal\n       marks of abuse are present on this\n       defiant edifice\u2014\n              all the physical features of\n\nac-\ncident\u2014lack\n       of cornice, dynamite grooves, burns, and\n       hatchet strokes, these things stand\n              out on it; the chasm-side is\n\ndead.\nRepeated\n       evidence has proved that it can live\n       on what can not revive\n              its youth.
