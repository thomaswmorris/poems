    The Heaven-lent treasures of the heart!\n     How conscious seems the frozen sod\n     And beechen slope whereon they trod\n     The oak-leaves rustle, and the dry grass bends\n     Beneath the shadowy feet of lost or absent friends.\n\n     XVIII.\n     Then ask not why to these bleak hills\n     I cling, as clings the tufted moss,\n     To bear the winter's lingering chills,\n     The

scattered sheaves of home and kin,\n     Than the mad license ushering Lenten pains,\n     Or holidays of slaves who laugh and dance in chains.\n\n     XXIII.\n     And sweet homes nestle in these dales,\n     And perch along these wooded swells;\n     And, blest beyond Arcadian vales,\n     They hear the sound of Sabbath bells!\n     Here dwells no perfect man sublime,\n     Nor woman winged before her time,\n     But with the faults and follies of the race,\n     Old home-bred virtues hold their not unhonored place.\n\n     XXIV.\n     Here manhood struggles for the sake\n     Of mother, sister, daughter, wife,\n     The graces and the loves which make\n     The music of the march of life;\n     And woman, in her daily round\n     Of duty, walks on holy ground.\n     No unpaid menial tills the soil, nor here\n     Is the bad lesson learned at human rights to sneer.\n\n     XXV.\n     Then let the icy north-wind blow\n     The trumpets of the coming storm,\n     To arrowy sleet and blinding snow\n     Yon slanting lines of rain transform.\n     Young hearts shall hail the drifted cold,\n     As gayly as I did of old;\n     And I, who watch them through the frosty pane,\n     Unenvious, live in them my boyhood o'er again.\n\n     XXVI.\n     And I will trust that He who heeds\n     The life that hides in mead and wold,\n     Who hangs yon alder's crimson beads,\n     And stains these mosses green and gold,\n     Will still, as He hath done, incline\n     His gracious care to me and mine;\n     Grant what we ask aright, from wrong debar,\n     And, as the earth grows dark, make brighter every star!\n\n     XXVII.\n     I have not seen, I may not see,\n     My hopes for man take form in fact,\n     But God will give the victory\n     In due time; in that faith I act.\n     And lie who sees the future sure,\n     The baffling present may endure,\n     And bless, meanwhile, the unseen Hand that leads\n     The heart's desires beyond the halting step of deeds.\n\n     XXVIII.\n     And thou, my song, I send thee forth,\n     Where harsher songs of mine have flown;\n     Go, find a place at home and hearth\n     Where'er thy singer's name is known;\n

hills are maple-crowned;\n     But not from them our fathers chose\n     The village burying-ground.\n\n     The dreariest spot in all the land\n     To Death they set apart;\n     With scanty grace from Nature's hand,\n     And none from that of Art.\n\n     A winding wall of mossy stone,\n     Frost-flung and broken, lines\n     A lonesome acre thinly grown\n     With grass and wandering vines.\n\n     Without the wall a birch-tree shows\n     Its drooped and tasselled head;\n     Within, a stag-horned sumach grows,\n     Fern-leafed, with spikes of red.\n\n     There, sheep that graze the neighboring plain\n     Like white ghosts come and go,\n     The farm-horse drags his fetlock chain,\n     The cow-bell tinkles slow.\n\n     Low moans the river from its bed,\n     The distant pines reply;\n     Like mourners shrinking from the dead,\n     They stand apart and sigh.\n\n     Unshaded smites the summer sun,\n     Unchecked the winter blast;\n     The school-girl learns the place to shun,\n     With glances backward cast.\n\n     For thus our fathers testified,\n     That he might read who ran,\n     The emptiness of human pride,\n     The nothingness of man.\n\n     They dared not plant the grave with flowers,\n     Nor dress the funeral sod,\n     Where, with a love as deep as ours,\n     They left their dead with God.\n\n     The hard and thorny path they kept\n     From beauty turned aside;\n     Nor missed they over those who slept\n     The grace to life denied.\n\n     Yet still the wilding flowers would blow,\n     The golden leaves would fall,\n     The seasons come, the seasons go,\n     And God be good to all.\n\n     Above the graves the' blackberry hung\n     In bloom and green its wreath,\n     And harebells swung as if they rung\n     The chimes of peace beneath.\n\n     The beauty Nature loves to share,\n     The gifts she hath for all,\n     The common light, the common air,\n     O'ercrept the graveyard's wall.\n\n     It knew the glow of eventide,\n     The sunrise and the noon,\n     And glorified and sanctified\n     It slept beneath the moon.\n\n     With flowers or snow-flakes for its sod,\n

 When He is pledged for all?\n\n     O fearful heart and troubled brain\n     Take hope and strength from this,--\n     That Nature never hints in vain,\n     Nor prophesies amiss.\n\n     Her wild

rudder of palm it steereth with.\n\n     Branches of palm are its spars and rails,\n     Fibres of palm are its woven sails,\n     And the rope is of palm that idly trails!\n\n     What does the good ship bear so well?\n     The cocoa-nut with its stony shell,\n     And the milky sap of its inner cell.\n\n     What are its jars, so smooth and fine,\n     But hollowed nuts, filled with oil and

strands,\n     And he holds a palm-leaf scroll in his hands,\n     Traced with the Prophet's wise commands!\n\n     The turban folded about his head\n     Was daintily wrought of the palm-leaf

the palm shall only cease\n     With the shroud wherein he lieth in peace.\n\n     \"Allah il Allah!\" he sings his psalm,\n     On the Indian Sea, by the isles of balm;\n     \"Thanks to Allah who

First a lake\n     Tinted with sunset; next the wavy lines\n     Of far receding hills; and yet more far,\n     Monadnock lifting from his night of pines\n     His rosy forehead to the evening star.\n     Beside us, purple-zoned, Wachuset laid\n     His head against the West, whose warm light made\n     His aureole; and o'er him, sharp and clear,\n     Like a shaft of lightning in mid-launching stayed,\n     A single level cloud-line, shone upon\n     By the fierce glances of the sunken sun,\n     Menaced the darkness with its golden spear!\n\n     So twilight deepened round us. Still and black\n     The great woods climbed the mountain at our back;\n     And on their skirts, where yet the lingering day\n     On the shorn greenness of the clearing lay,\n     The brown old farm-house like a bird's-nest hung.\n     With home-life sounds the desert air was stirred\n     The bleat of sheep along the hill we heard,\n     The bucket plashing in the cool, sweet well,\n     The pasture-bars that clattered as they fell;\n     Dogs barked, fowls fluttered, cattle lowed; the gate\n     Of the barn-yard creaked beneath the merry weight\n     Of sun-brown children, listening, while they swung,\n     The welcome sound of supper-call to hear;\n     And down the shadowy lane, in tinklings clear,\n     The pastoral curfew of the cow-bell rung.\n     Thus soothed and pleased, our backward path we took,\n     Praising the farmer's home. He only spake,\n     Looking into the sunset o'er the lake,\n     Like one to whom the far-off is most near:\n     \"Yes, most folks think it has a pleasant look;\n     I love it for my good old mother's sake,\n     Who lived and died here in the peace of God!\"\n     The lesson of his words we pondered o'er,\n     As silently we turned the eastern flank\n     Of the mountain, where its shadow deepest sank,\n     Doubling the night along our rugged road:\n     We felt that man was more than his abode,--\n     The inward life than Nature's raiment more;\n     And the warm sky, the

tongue was mute,\n     From eye and lip in music spoke.\n\n     How thrills once more the lengthening chain\n     Of memory, at the thought of thee!\n     Old hopes which long in dust have lain\n     Old dreams, come thronging back again,\n     And boyhood lives again in me;\n     I feel its glow upon my cheek,\n     Its fulness of the heart is mine,\n     As when I leaned to hear thee speak,\n     Or raised my doubtful eye to thine.\n\n     I hear again thy low replies,\n     I feel thy arm within my own,\n     And timidly again uprise\n     The fringed lids of hazel eyes,\n     With soft brown tresses overblown.\n     Ah! memories of sweet summer eves,\n     Of moonlit wave and willowy way,\n     Of stars and flowers, and dewy leaves,\n     And smiles and tones more dear than they!\n\n     Ere this, thy quiet eye hath smiled\n     My picture of thy youth to see,\n     When, half a woman, half a child,\n     Thy very artlessness beguiled,\n     And folly's self seemed wise in thee;\n     I too can smile, when o'er that hour\n     The lights of memory backward stream,\n     Yet feel the while that manhood's power\n     Is vainer than my boyhood's dream.\n\n     Years have passed on, and left their trace,\n     Of graver care and deeper thought;\n     And unto me the calm, cold face\n     Of manhood, and to thee the grace\n     Of woman's pensive beauty brought.\n     More wide, perchance, for blame than praise,\n     The school-boy's humble name has flown;\n     Thine, in the green and quiet ways\n     Of unobtrusive goodness known.\n\n     And wider yet in thought and deed\n     Diverge our pathways, one in youth;\n     Thine the Genevan's sternest creed,\n     While answers to my spirit's need\n     The Derby dalesman's simple truth.\n     For thee, the priestly rite and prayer,\n     And holy day, and solemn psalm;\n     For me, the silent reverence where\n     My brethren gather, slow and calm.\n\n     Yet hath thy spirit left on me\n     An impress Time has worn not out,\n     And something of myself in thee,\n     A shadow from the past, I see,\n     Lingering, even yet, thy way about;\n     Not wholly can the heart unlearn\n     That lesson of its better hours,\n     Not yet has Time's dull footstep worn\n     To common dust that path of flowers.\n\n     Thus, while at times before our eyes\n     The shadows melt, and fall apart,\n     And, smiling through them, round us lies\n     The warm light of our morning skies,--\n     The Indian Summer of the heart!\n     In secret sympathies of mind,\n     In founts of feeling which retain\n     Their pure, fresh flow, we yet may find\n     Our early dreams not wholly vain", "RAPHAEL": "Suggested by the portrait of Raphael, at the age of fifteen.\n\n     I shall not soon forget that sight\n     The glow of Autumn's westering day,\n     A hazy warmth, a dreamy light,\n     On Raphael's picture lay.\n\n     It was a simple print I saw,\n     The fair face of a musing boy;\n     Yet, while I gazed, a sense of awe\n     Seemed blending with my joy.\n\n     A simple print,--the graceful flow\n     Of boyhood's soft and wavy hair,\n     And fresh young lip and cheek, and brow\n     Unmarked and clear, were there.\n\n     Yet through its sweet and calm repose\n     I saw the inward spirit shine;\n     It was as if before me rose\n     The white veil of a shrine.\n\n     As if, as Gothland's sage has told,\n     The hidden life, the man within,\n     Dissevered from its frame and mould,\n     By mortal eye were seen.\n\n     Was it the lifting of that eye,\n     The waving of that pictured hand?\n     Loose as a cloud-wreath on the sky,\n     I saw the walls expand.\n\n     The narrow room had vanished,--space,\n     Broad, luminous, remained alone,\n     Through which all hues and shapes of grace\n     And beauty looked or shone.\n\n     Around the mighty master came\n     The marvels which his pencil wrought,\n     Those miracles of power whose fame\n     Is wide as human thought.\n\n     There drooped thy more than mortal face,\n     O Mother, beautiful and mild\n     Enfolding in one dear embrace\n     Thy Saviour and thy Child!\n\n     The rapt brow of the Desert John;\n     The awful glory of that day\n     When all the Father's brightness shone\n     Through manhood's veil of clay.\n\n     And, midst gray prophet forms, and wild\n     Dark visions of the days of old,\n     How sweetly woman's beauty smiled\n     Through locks of brown and gold!\n\n     There Fornarina's fair young face\n     Once more upon her lover shone,\n     Whose model of an angel's grace\n     He borrowed from her own.\n\n     Slow passed that vision from my view,\n     But not the lesson which it taught;\n     The soft, calm shadows which it threw\n     Still rested on my thought:\n\n     The truth, that painter, bard, and sage,\n     Even in Earth's cold and changeful clime,\n     Plant for their deathless heritage\n     The fruits and flowers of time.\n\n     We shape ourselves the joy or fear\n     Of which the coming life is made,\n     And fill our Future's atmosphere\n     With sunshine or with shade.\n\n     The tissue of the Life to be\n     We weave with colors all our own,\n     And in the field of Destiny\n     We reap as we have sown.\n\n     Still shall the soul around it call\n     The shadows which it gathered here,\n     And, painted on the eternal wall,\n     The Past shall reappear.\n\n     Think ye the notes of holy song\n     On Milton's tuneful ear have died?\n     Think ye that Raphael's angel throng\n     Has vanished from his side?\n\n     Oh no!--We live our life again;\n     Or warmly touched, or coldly dim,\n     The pictures of the Past remain,---\n     Man's works shall follow him!", "EGO": "     On page of thine I cannot trace\n     The cold and heartless commonplace,\n     A statue's fixed and marble grace.\n\n     For ever as these lines I penned,\n     Still with the thought of thee will blend\n     That of some loved and common friend,\n\n     Who in life's desert track has made\n     His pilgrim tent with mine, or strayed\n     Beneath the same remembered shade.\n\n     And hence my pen unfettered moves\n     In freedom which the heart approves,\n     The negligence which friendship loves.\n\n     And wilt thou prize my poor gift less\n     For simple air and rustic dress,\n     And sign of haste and carelessness?\n\n     Oh, more than specious counterfeit\n     Of sentiment or studied wit,\n     A heart like thine should value it.\n\n     Yet half I fear my gift will be\n     Unto thy book, if not to thee,\n     Of more than doubtful courtesy.\n\n     A banished name from Fashion's sphere,\n     A lay unheard of Beauty's ear,\n     Forbid, disowned,--what do they here?\n\n     Upon my ear not all in vain\n     Came the sad captive's clanking chain,\n     The groaning from his bed of pain.\n\n     And sadder still, I saw the woe\n     Which only wounded spirits know\n     When Pride's strong footsteps o'er them go.\n\n     Spurned not alone in walks abroad,\n     But from the temples of the Lord\n     Thrust out apart, like things abhorred.\n\n     Deep as I felt, and stern and strong,\n     In words which Prudence smothered long,\n     My soul spoke out against the wrong;\n\n     Not mine alone the task to speak\n     Of comfort to the poor and weak,\n     And dry the tear on Sorrow's cheek;\n\n     But, mingled in the conflict warm,\n     To pour the fiery breath of storm\n     Through the harsh trumpet of Reform;\n\n     To brave Opinion's settled frown,\n     From ermined robe and saintly gown,\n     While wrestling reverenced Error down.\n\n     Founts gushed beside my pilgrim way,\n     Cool shadows on the greensward lay,\n     Flowers swung upon the bending spray.\n\n     And, broad and bright, on either hand,\n     Stretched the green slopes of Fairy-land,\n     With Hope's eternal sunbow spanned;\n\n     Whence voices called me like the flow,\n     Which on the listener's ear will grow,\n     Of forest streamlets soft and low.\n\n     And gentle eyes, which still retain\n     Their picture on the heart and brain,\n     Smiled, beckoning from that path of pain.\n\n     In vain! nor dream, nor rest, nor pause\n     Remain for him who round him draws\n     The battered mail of Freedom's cause.\n\n     From youthful hopes, from each green spot\n     Of young Romance, and gentle Thought,\n     Where storm and tumult enter not;\n\n     From each fair altar, where belong\n     The offerings Love requires of Song\n     In homage to her bright-eyed throng;\n\n     With soul and strength, with heart and hand,\n     I turned to Freedom's struggling band,\n     To the sad Helots of our land.\n\n     What marvel then that Fame should turn\n     Her notes of praise to those of scorn;\n     Her gifts reclaimed, her smiles withdrawn?\n\n     What matters it? a few years more,\n     Life's surge so restless heretofore\n     Shall break upon the unknown shore!\n\n     In that far land shall disappear\n     The shadows which we follow here,\n     The mist-wreaths of our atmosphere!\n\n     Before no work of mortal hand,\n     Of human will or strength expand\n     The pearl gates of the Better Land;\n\n     Alone in that great love which gave\n     Life to the sleeper of the grave,\n     Resteth the power to seek and save.\n\n     Yet, if the spirit gazing through\n     The vista of the past can view\n     One deed to Heaven and virtue true;\n\n     If through the wreck of wasted powers,\n     Of garlands wreathed from Folly's bowers,\n     Of idle aims and misspent hours,\n\n     The eye can note one sacred spot\n     By Pride and Self profaned not,\n     A green place in the waste of thought,\n\n     Where deed or word hath rendered less\n     The sum of human wretchedness,\n     And Gratitude looks forth to bless;\n\n     The simple burst of tenderest feeling\n     From sad hearts worn by evil-dealing,\n     For blessing on the hand of healing;\n\n     Better than Glory's pomp will be\n     That green and blessed spot to me,\n     A palm-shade in Eternity!\n\n     Something of Time which may invite\n     The purified and spiritual sight\n     To rest on with a calm delight.\n\n     And when the summer winds shall sweep\n     With their light wings my place of sleep,\n     And mosses round my headstone creep;\n\n     If still, as Freedom's rallying sign,\n     Upon the young heart's altars shine\n     The very fires they caught from mine;\n\n     If words my lips once uttered still,\n     In the calm faith and steadfast will\n     Of other hearts, their work fulfil;\n\n     Perchance with joy the soul may learn\n     These tokens, and its eye discern\n     The fires which on those altars burn;\n\n     A marvellous joy that even then,\n     The spirit hath its life again,\n     In the strong hearts of mortal men.\n\n     Take, lady, then, the gift I bring,\n     No gay and graceful offering,\n     No flower-smile of the laughing spring.\n\n     Midst the green buds of Youth's fresh May,\n     With Fancy's leaf-enwoven bay,\n     My sad and sombre gift I lay.\n\n     And if it deepens in thy mind\n     A sense of suffering human-kind,--\n     The outcast and the spirit-blind;\n\n     Oppressed and spoiled on every side,\n     By Prejudice, and Scorn, and Pride,\n     Life's common courtesies denied;\n\n     Sad mothers mourning o'er their trust,\n     Children by want and misery nursed,\n     Tasting life's bitter cup at first;\n\n     If to their strong appeals which come\n     From fireless hearth, and crowded room,\n     And the close alley's noisome gloom,--\n\n     Though dark the hands upraised to thee\n     In mute beseeching agony,\n     Thou lend'st thy woman's sympathy;\n\n     Not vainly on thy gentle shrine,\n     Where Love, and Mirth, and Friendship twine\n     Their varied gifts, I offer mine.", "THE PUMPKIN": "     Oh, greenly and fair in the lands of the sun,\n     The vines of the gourd and the rich melon run,\n     And the rock and the tree and the cottage enfold,\n     With broad leaves all greenness and blossoms all gold,\n     Like that which o'er Nineveh's prophet once grew,\n     While he waited to know that his warning was true,\n     And longed for the storm-cloud, and listened in vain\n     For the rush of the whirlwind and red fire-rain.\n\n     On the banks of the Xenil the dark Spanish maiden\n     Comes up with the fruit of the tangled vine laden;\n     And the Creole of Cuba laughs out to behold\n     Through orange-leaves shining the broad spheres of gold;\n     Yet with dearer delight from his home in the North,\n     On the fields of his harvest the Yankee looks forth,\n     Where crook-necks are coiling and yellow fruit shines,\n     And the sun of September melts down on his vines.\n\n     Ah! on Thanksgiving day, when from East and from West,\n     From North and from South come the pilgrim and guest,\n     When the gray-haired New-Englander sees round his board\n     The old broken links of affection restored,\n     When the care-wearied man seeks his mother once more,\n     And the worn matron smiles where the girl smiled  before,\n     What moistens the lip and what brightens the eye?\n     What calls back the past, like the rich Pumpkin pie?\n\n     Oh, fruit loved of boyhood! the old days recalling,\n     When wood-grapes were purpling and brown nuts were falling!\n     When wild, ugly faces we carved in its skin,\n     Glaring out through the dark with a candle within!\n     When we laughed round the corn-heap, with hearts all in tune,\n     Our chair a broad pumpkin,--our lantern the moon,\n     Telling tales of the fairy who travelled like steam,\n     In a pumpkin-shell coach, with two rats for her team\n     Then thanks for thy present! none sweeter or better\n     E'er smoked from an oven or circled a platter!\n     Fairer hands never wrought at a pastry more fine,\n     Brighter eyes never watched o'er its baking, than thine!\n     And the prayer, which my mouth is too full to express,\n     Swells my heart that thy shadow may never be less,\n     That the days of thy lot may be lengthened below,\n     And the fame of thy worth like a pumpkin-vine grow,\n     And thy life be as sweet,

 So, turning gloomily from my fellow-men,\n     One summer Sabbath day I strolled among\n     The green mounds of the village burial-place;\n     Where, pondering how all human love and hate\n     Find one sad level; and how, soon or late,\n     Wronged and wrongdoer, each with meekened face,\n     And cold hands folded over a still heart,\n     Pass the green threshold of our common grave,\n     Whither all footsteps tend, whence none depart,\n     Awed for myself, and pitying my race,\n     Our common sorrow, like a nighty wave,\n     Swept all my pride away, and trembling I forgave!", "TO MY SISTER": "     Dear Sister! while the wise and sage\n     Turn coldly from my playful page,\n     And count it strange that ripened age\n     Should stoop to boyhood's folly;\n     I know that thou

moonlit gate of dreams!\n     Leave free once more the land which teems\n     With wonders and romances\n     Where thou, with clear discerning eyes,\n     Shalt rightly read the truth which lies\n     Beneath the quaintly masking guise\n     Of wild and wizard fancies.\n\n     Lo! once again our feet we set\n     On still green wood-paths, twilight wet,\n     By lonely brooks, whose waters fret\n

wings;\n\n     Till starting from his sandy bed,\n     The wayworn wanderer looks to see\n     The halo of an angel's head\n     Shine through the tamarisk-tree.\n\n     So through the shadows of my way\n     Thy smile hath fallen soft and clear,\n     So at the weary close of day\n     Hath seemed thy voice of cheer.\n\n     That pilgrim pressing to his goal\n     May pause not for the vision's sake,\n     Yet all fair things within his soul\n     The thought of it shall wake:\n\n     The graceful palm-tree by the well,\n     Seen on the far horizon's rim;\n     The dark eyes of the fleet

see,\n     Nor judged by one unseemly bough\n     The upward-struggling tree.\n\n     These light leaves at thy feet I lay,--\n     Poor common thoughts on common things,\n     Which time is shaking, day by day,\n     Like feathers from his wings;\n\n     Chance shootings from a frail life-tree,\n     To nurturing care but little known,\n     Their good was partly learned of thee,\n     Their folly is my own.\n\n     That tree still clasps the kindly mould,\n     Its leaves still drink the twilight dew,\n     And weaving its pale green with gold,\n     Still shines the sunlight through.\n\n     There still the morning zephyrs play,\n     And there at times the spring bird sings,\n     And mossy trunk and fading spray\n     Are flowered with glossy wings.\n\n     Yet, even in genial sun and rain,\n     Root, branch, and leaflet fail and fade;\n     The wanderer on its lonely plain\n     Erelong shall miss its shade.\n\n     O friend beloved, whose curious skill\n     Keeps bright the last year's leaves and flowers,\n     With warm, glad, summer thoughts to fill\n     The cold, dark, winter hours\n\n     Pressed on thy heart, the leaves I bring\n     May well defy the

The Snow Storm.\n\n\n     The sun that brief December day\n     Rose cheerless over hills of gray,\n     And, darkly circled, gave at noon\n     A sadder light than waning moon.\n     Slow tracing down the thickening sky\n     Its mute and ominous prophecy,\n     A portent seeming less than threat,\n     It sank from sight before it set.\n     A chill no coat, however stout,\n     Of homespun stuff could quite, shut out,\n     A hard, dull bitterness of cold,\n     That checked, mid-vein, the circling race\n     Of life-blood in the sharpened face,\n     The coming of the snow-storm told.\n     The wind blew east; we heard the roar\n     Of Ocean on his wintry shore,\n     And felt the strong pulse throbbing there\n     Beat with low rhythm our inland air.\n\n     Meanwhile we did our nightly chores,--\n     Brought in the wood from out of doors,\n     Littered the stalls, and from the mows\n     Raked down the herd's-grass for the cows\n     Heard the horse whinnying for his corn;\n     And, sharply clashing horn on horn,\n     Impatient down the stanchion rows\n     The cattle shake their walnut bows;\n     While, peering from his early perch\n     Upon the scaffold's pole of birch,\n     The cock his crested helmet bent\n     And down his querulous challenge sent.\n\n     Unwarmed by any sunset light\n     The gray day darkened into night,\n     A night made hoary with the swarm,\n     And whirl-dance of the blinding storm,\n     As zigzag, wavering to and fro,\n     Crossed and recrossed the winged snow\n     And ere the early bedtime came\n     The white drift piled the window-frame,\n     And through the glass the clothes-line posts\n     Looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts.\n\n     So all night long the storm roared on\n     The morning broke without a sun;\n     In tiny spherule traced with lines\n     Of Nature's geometric signs,\n     In starry flake, and pellicle,\n     All day the hoary meteor fell;\n     And, when the second morning shone,\n     We looked upon a world unknown,\n     On nothing we could call our own.\n     Around the glistening wonder bent\n     The blue walls of the firmament,\n     No cloud above, no earth below,--\n     A universe of sky and snow\n     The old familiar sights of ours\n     Took marvellous shapes; strange domes and towers\n     Rose up where sty or corn-crib stood,\n     Or garden-wall, or belt of wood;\n     A smooth white mound the brush-pile showed,\n     A fenceless drift what once was road;\n     The bridle-post an old man sat\n     With loose-flung coat and high cocked hat;\n     The well-curb had a Chinese roof;\n     And even the long sweep, high aloof,\n     In its slant splendor, seemed to tell\n     Of Pisa's leaning miracle.\n\n     A prompt, decisive man, no breath\n     Our father wasted: \"Boys, a path!\"\n     Well pleased, (for when did farmer boy\n     Count such a summons less than joy?)\n     Our buskins on our feet we drew;\n     With mittened hands, and caps drawn low,\n     To guard our necks and ears from snow,\n     We cut the solid whiteness through.\n     And, where the drift was deepest, made\n     A tunnel walled and overlaid\n     With dazzling crystal: we had read\n     Of rare Aladdin's wondrous cave,\n     And to our own his name we gave,\n     With many a wish the luck were ours\n     To test his lamp's supernal powers.\n     We reached the barn with merry din,\n     And roused the prisoned brutes within.\n     The old horse thrust his long head out,\n     And grave with wonder gazed about;\n     The cock his lusty greeting said,\n     And forth his speckled harem led;\n     The oxen lashed their tails, and hooked,\n     And mild reproach of hunger looked;\n     The horned patriarch of the sheep,\n     Like Egypt's Amun roused from sleep,\n     Shook his sage head with gesture mute,\n     And emphasized with stamp of foot.\n\n     All day the gusty north-wind bore\n     The loosening drift its breath before;\n     Low circling round its southern zone,\n     The sun through dazzling snow-mist shone.\n     No church-bell lent its Christian tone\n     To the savage air, no social smoke\n     Curled over woods of snow-hung oak.\n     A solitude made more intense\n     By dreary-voiced elements,\n     The shrieking of the mindless wind,\n     The moaning tree-boughs swaying blind,\n     And on the glass the unmeaning beat\n     Of ghostly finger-tips of sleet.\n     Beyond the circle of our hearth\n     No welcome sound of toil or mirth\n     Unbound the spell, and testified\n     Of human life and thought outside.\n     We minded that the sharpest ear\n     The buried brooklet could not hear,\n     The music of whose liquid lip\n     Had been to us companionship,\n     And, in our lonely life, had grown\n     To have an almost human tone.\n\n     As night drew on, and, from the crest\n     Of wooded knolls that ridged the west,\n     The sun, a snow-blown traveller, sank\n     From sight beneath the smothering bank,\n     We piled, with care, our nightly stack\n     Of wood against the chimney-back,--\n     The oaken log, green, huge, and thick,\n     And on its top the stout back-stick;\n     The knotty forestick laid apart,\n     And filled between with curious art\n     The ragged brush; then, hovering near,\n     We watched the first red blaze appear,\n     Heard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam\n     On whitewashed wall and sagging beam,\n     Until the old, rude-furnished room\n     Burst, flower-like, into rosy bloom;\n     While radiant with a mimic flame\n     Outside the sparkling drift became,\n     And through the bare-boughed lilac-tree\n     Our own warm hearth seemed blazing free.\n     The crane and pendent trammels showed,\n     The Turks' heads on the andirons glowed;\n     While childish fancy, prompt to tell\n     The meaning of the miracle,\n     Whispered the old rhyme: \"_Under the tree,\n     When fire outdoors burns merrily,\n     There the witches are making tea_.\"\n\n     The moon above the eastern wood\n     Shone at its full; the hill-range stood\n     Transfigured in the silver flood,\n     Its blown snows flashing cold and keen,\n     Dead white, save where some sharp ravine\n     Took shadow, or the sombre green\n     Of hemlocks turned to pitchy black\n     Against the whiteness at their back.\n     For such a world and such a night\n     Most fitting that unwarming light,\n     Which only seemed where'er it fell\n     To make the coldness visible.\n\n     Shut in from all the world without,\n     We sat the clean-winged hearth about,\n     Content to let the north-wind roar\n     In baffled rage at pane and door,\n     While the red logs before us beat\n     The frost-line back with tropic heat;\n     And ever, when a louder blast\n     Shook beam and rafter as it passed,\n     The merrier up its roaring draught\n     The great throat of the chimney laughed;\n     The house-dog on his paws outspread\n     Laid to the fire his drowsy head,\n     The cat's dark silhouette on the wall\n     A couchant tiger's seemed to fall;\n     And, for the winter fireside meet,\n     Between the andirons' straddling feet,\n     The mug of cider simmered slow,\n     The apples sputtered in a row,\n     And, close at hand, the basket stood\n     With nuts from brown October's wood.\n\n     What matter how the night behaved?\n     What matter how the north-wind raved?\n     Blow high, blow low, not all its snow\n     Could quench our hearth-fire's ruddy glow.\n     O Time and Change!--with hair as gray\n     As was my sire's that winter day,\n     How strange it seems, with so much gone\n     Of life and love, to still live on!\n     Ah, brother! only I and thou\n     Are left of all that circle now,--\n     The dear home faces whereupon\n     That fitful firelight paled and shone.\n     Henceforward, listen as we will,\n     The voices of that hearth are still;\n     Look where we may, the wide earth o'er\n     Those lighted faces smile no more.\n     We tread the paths their feet have worn,\n     We sit beneath their orchard trees,\n     We hear, like them, the hum of bees\n     And rustle of the bladed corn;\n     We turn the pages that they read,\n     Their written words we linger o'er,\n     But in the sun they cast no shade,\n     No voice is heard, no sign is made,\n     No step is on the conscious floor!\n     Yet Love will dream, and Faith will trust,\n     (Since He who knows our need is just,)\n     That somehow, somewhere, meet we must.\n     Alas for him who never sees\n     The stars shine through his cypress-trees\n     Who, hopeless, lays his dead away,\n     Nor looks to see the breaking day\n     Across the mournful marbles play!\n     Who hath not learned, in hours of faith,\n     The truth to flesh and sense unknown,\n     That Life is ever lord of Death,\n     And Love can never lose its own!\n\n     We sped the time with stories old,\n     Wrought puzzles out, and riddles told,\n     Or stammered from our school-book lore\n     The Chief of Gambia's \"golden shore.\"\n     How often since, when all the land\n     Was clay in Slavery's shaping hand,\n     As if a far-blown trumpet stirred\n     The languorous sin-sick air, I heard\n     \"_Does not the voice of reason cry,\n     Claim the first right which Nature gave,\n     From the red scourge of bondage fly,\n     Nor deign to live a burdened slave_!\"\n     Our father rode again his ride\n     On Memphremagog's wooded side;\n     Sat down again to moose and samp\n     In trapper's hut and Indian camp;\n     Lived o'er the old idyllic ease\n     Beneath St. Francois' hemlock-trees;\n     Again for him the moonlight shone\n     On Norman cap and bodiced zone;\n     Again he heard the violin play\n     Which led the village dance away,\n     And mingled in its merry whirl\n     The grandam and the laughing girl.\n     Or, nearer home, our steps he led\n     Where Salisbury's level marshes spread\n     Mile-wide as flies the laden bee;\n     Where merry mowers, hale and strong,\n     Swept, scythe on scythe, their swaths along\n     The low green prairies of the sea.\n     We shared the fishing off Boar's Head,\n     And round the rocky Isles of Shoals\n     The hake-broil on the drift-wood coals;\n     The chowder on the sand-beach made,\n     Dipped by the hungry, steaming hot,\n     With spoons of clam-shell from the pot.\n     We heard the tales of witchcraft old,\n     And dream and sign and marvel told\n     To sleepy listeners as they lay\n     Stretched idly on the salted hay,\n     Adrift along the winding shores,\n     When favoring breezes deigned to blow\n     The square sail of the gundelow\n     And idle lay the useless oars.\n\n     Our mother, while she turned her wheel\n     Or run the new-knit stocking-heel,\n     Told how the Indian hordes came down\n     At midnight on Cocheco town,\n     And how her own great-uncle bore\n     His cruel scalp-mark to fourscore.\n     Recalling, in her fitting phrase,\n     So rich and picturesque and free,\n     (The common unrhymed poetry\n     Of simple life and country ways,)\n     The story of her early days,--\n     She made us welcome to her home;\n     Old hearths grew wide to give us room;\n     We stole with her a frightened look\n     At the gray wizard's conjuring-book,\n     The fame whereof went far and wide\n     Through all the simple country side;\n     We heard the hawks at twilight play,\n     The boat-horn on Piscataqua,\n     The loon's weird laughter far away;\n     We fished her little trout-brook, knew\n     What flowers in wood and meadow grew,\n     What sunny hillsides autumn-brown\n     She climbed to shake the ripe nuts down,\n     Saw where in sheltered cove and bay\n     The ducks' black squadron anchored lay,\n     And heard the wild-geese calling loud\n     Beneath the gray November cloud.\n\n     Then, haply, with a look more grave,\n     And soberer tone, some tale she gave\n     From painful Sewell's ancient tome,\n     Beloved in every Quaker home,\n     Of faith fire-winged by martyrdom,\n     Or Chalkley's Journal, old and quaint,--\n     Gentlest of skippers, rare sea-saint!--\n     Who, when the dreary calms prevailed,\n     And water-butt and bread-cask failed,\n     And cruel, hungry eyes pursued\n     His portly presence mad for food,\n     With dark hints muttered under breath\n     Of casting lots for life or death,\n     Offered, if Heaven withheld supplies,\n     To be himself the sacrifice.\n     Then, suddenly, as if to save\n     The good man from his living grave,\n     A ripple on the water grew,\n     A school of porpoise flashed in view.\n     \"Take, eat,\" he said, \"and be content;\n     These fishes in my stead are sent\n     By Him who gave the tangled ram\n     To spare the child of Abraham.\"\n\n     Our uncle, innocent of books,\n     Was rich in lore of fields and brooks,\n     The ancient teachers never dumb\n     Of Nature's unhoused lyceum.\n     In moons and tides and weather wise,\n     He read the clouds as prophecies,\n     And foul or fair could well divine,\n     By many an occult hint and sign,\n     Holding the cunning-warded keys\n     To all the woodcraft mysteries;\n     Himself to Nature's heart so near\n     That all her voices in his ear\n     Of beast or bird had meanings clear,\n     Like Apollonius of old,\n     Who knew the tales the sparrows told,\n     Or Hermes who interpreted\n     What the sage cranes of Nilus said;\n\n     Content to live where life began;\n     A simple, guileless, childlike man,\n     Strong only on his native grounds,\n     The little world of sights and sounds\n     Whose girdle was the parish bounds,\n     Whereof his fondly partial pride\n     The common features magnified,\n     As Surrey hills to mountains grew\n     In White of Selborne's loving view,--\n     He told how teal and loon he shot,\n     And how the eagle's eggs he got,\n     The feats on pond and river done,\n     The prodigies of rod and gun;\n     Till, warming with the tales he told,\n     Forgotten was the outside cold,\n     The bitter wind unheeded blew,\n     From ripening corn the pigeons flew,\n     The partridge drummed I' the wood, the mink\n     Went fishing down the river-brink.\n     In fields with bean or clover gay,\n     The woodchuck, like a hermit gray,\n     Peered from the doorway of his cell;\n     The muskrat plied the mason's trade,\n     And tier by tier his mud-walls laid;\n     And from the shagbark overhead\n     The grizzled squirrel dropped his shell.\n\n     Next, the dear aunt, whose smile of cheer\n     And voice in dreams I see and hear,--\n     The sweetest woman ever Fate\n     Perverse denied a household mate,\n     Who, lonely, homeless, not the less\n     Found peace in love's unselfishness,\n     And welcome wheresoe'er she went,\n     A calm and gracious element,--\n     Whose presence seemed the sweet income\n     And womanly atmosphere of home,--\n     Called up her girlhood memories,\n     The huskings and the apple-bees,\n     The sleigh-rides and the summer sails,\n     Weaving through all the poor details\n     And homespun warp of circumstance\n     A golden woof-thread of romance.\n     For well she kept her genial mood\n     And simple faith of maidenhood;\n     Before her still a cloud-land lay,\n     The mirage loomed across her way;\n     The morning dew, that dries so soon\n     With others, glistened at her noon;\n     Through years of toil and soil and care,\n     From glossy tress to thin gray hair,\n     All unprofaned she held apart\n     The virgin fancies of the heart.\n     Be shame to him of woman born\n     Who hath for such but thought of scorn.\n\n     There, too, our elder sister plied\n     Her evening task the stand beside;\n     A full, rich nature, free to trust,\n     Truthful and almost sternly just,\n     Impulsive, earnest, prompt to act,\n     And make her generous thought a fact,\n     Keeping with many a light disguise\n     The secret of self-sacrifice.\n     O heart sore-tried! thou hast the best\n     That Heaven itself could give thee,--rest,\n\n     Rest from all bitter thoughts and things!\n     How many a poor one's blessing went\n     With thee beneath the low green tent\n     Whose curtain never outward swings!\n\n     As one who held herself a part\n     Of all she saw, and let her heart\n     Against the household bosom lean,\n     Upon the motley-braided mat\n     Our youngest and our dearest sat,\n     Lifting her large, sweet, asking eyes,\n     Now bathed in the unfading green\n     And holy peace of Paradise.\n     Oh, looking from some heavenly hill,\n     Or from the shade of saintly palms,\n     Or silver reach of river calms,\n     Do those large eyes behold me still?\n     With me one little year ago:--\n     The chill weight of the winter snow\n     For months upon her grave has lain;\n     And now, when summer south-winds blow\n     And brier and harebell bloom again,\n     I tread the pleasant paths we trod,\n     I see the violet-sprinkled sod\n     Whereon she leaned, too frail and weak\n     The hillside flowers she loved to seek,\n     Yet following me where'er I went\n     With dark eyes full of love's content.\n     The birds are glad; the brier-rose fills\n     The air with sweetness; all the hills\n     Stretch green to June's unclouded sky;\n     But still I wait with ear and eye\n     For something gone which should be nigh,\n     A loss in all familiar things,\n     In flower that blooms, and bird that sings.\n     And yet, dear heart' remembering thee,\n     Am I not richer than of old?\n     Safe in thy immortality,\n     What change can reach the wealth I hold?\n     What chance can mar the pearl and gold\n     Thy love hath left in trust with me?\n     And while in life's late afternoon,\n     Where cool and long the shadows grow,\n     I walk to meet the night that soon\n     Shall shape and shadow overflow,\n     I cannot feel that thou art far,\n     Since near at need the angels are;\n     And when the sunset gates unbar,\n     Shall I not see thee waiting stand,\n     And, white against the evening star,\n     The welcome of thy beckoning hand?\n\n     Brisk wielder of the birch and rule,\n     The master of the district school\n     Held at the fire his favored place,\n     Its warm glow lit a laughing face\n     Fresh-hued and fair, where scarce appeared\n     The uncertain prophecy of beard.\n     He teased the mitten-blinded cat,\n     Played cross-pins on my uncle's hat,\n     Sang songs, and told us what befalls\n     In classic Dartmouth's college halls.\n     Born the wild Northern hills among,\n     From whence his yeoman father wrung\n     By patient toil subsistence scant,\n     Not competence and yet not want,\n\n     He early gained the power to pay\n     His cheerful, self-reliant way;\n     Could doff at ease his scholar's gown\n     To peddle wares from town to town;\n     Or through the long vacation's reach\n     In lonely lowland districts teach,\n     Where all the droll experience found\n     At stranger hearths in boarding round,\n     The moonlit skater's keen delight,\n     The sleigh-drive through the frosty night,\n     The rustic party, with its rough\n     Accompaniment of blind-man's-buff,\n     And whirling plate, and forfeits paid,\n     His winter task a pastime made.\n     Happy the snow-locked homes wherein\n     He tuned his merry violin,\n     Or played the athlete in the barn,\n     Or held the good dame's winding-yarn,\n     Or mirth-provoking versions told\n     Of classic legends rare and old,\n     Wherein the scenes of Greece and Rome\n     Had all the commonplace of home,\n     And little seemed at best the odds\n     'Twixt Yankee pedlers and old gods;\n     Where Pindus-born Arachthus took\n     The guise of any grist-mill brook,\n     And dread Olympus at his will\n     Became a huckleberry hill.\n\n     A careless boy that night he seemed;\n     But at his desk he had the look\n     And air of one who wisely schemed,\n     And hostage from the future took\n     In trained thought and lore of book.\n     Large-brained, clear-eyed, of such as he\n     Shall Freedom's young apostles be,\n     Who, following in War's bloody trail,\n     Shall every lingering wrong assail;\n     All chains from limb and spirit strike,\n     Uplift the black and white alike;\n     Scatter before their swift advance\n     The darkness and the ignorance,\n     The pride, the lust, the squalid sloth,\n     Which nurtured Treason's monstrous growth,\n     Made murder pastime, and the hell\n     Of prison-torture possible;\n     The cruel lie of caste refute,\n     Old forms remould, and substitute\n     For Slavery's lash the freeman's will,\n     For blind routine, wise-handed skill;\n     A school-house plant on every hill,\n     Stretching in radiate nerve-lines thence\n     The quick wires of intelligence;\n     Till North and South together brought\n     Shall own the same electric thought,\n     In peace a common flag salute,\n     And, side by side in labor's free\n     And unresentful rivalry,\n     Harvest the fields wherein they fought.\n\n     Another guest that winter night\n     Flashed back from lustrous eyes the light.\n     Unmarked by time, and yet not young,\n     The honeyed music of her tongue\n     And words of meekness scarcely told\n     A nature passionate and bold,\n     Strong, self-concentred, spurning guide,\n     Its milder features dwarfed beside\n     Her unbent will's majestic pride.\n     She sat among us, at the best,\n     A not unfeared, half-welcome guest,\n     Rebuking with her cultured phrase\n     Our homeliness of words and ways.\n     A certain pard-like, treacherous grace\n     Swayed the lithe limbs and dropped the lash,\n     Lent the white teeth their dazzling flash;\n     And under low brows, black with night,\n     Rayed out at times a dangerous light;\n     The sharp heat-lightnings of her face\n     Presaging ill to him whom Fate\n     Condemned to share her love or hate.\n     A woman tropical, intense\n     In thought and act, in soul and sense,\n     She blended in a like degree\n     The vixen and the devotee,\n     Revealing with each freak or feint\n     The temper of Petruchio's Kate,\n     The raptures of Siena's saint.\n     Her tapering hand and rounded wrist\n     Had facile power to form a fist;\n     The warm, dark languish of her eyes\n     Was never safe from wrath's surprise.\n     Brows saintly calm and lips devout\n     Knew every change of scowl and pout;\n     And the sweet voice had notes more high\n     And shrill for social battle-cry.\n\n     Since then what old cathedral town\n     Has missed her pilgrim staff and gown,\n     What convent-gate has held its lock\n     Against the challenge of her knock!\n     Through Smyrna's plague-hushed thoroughfares,\n     Up sea-set Malta's rocky stairs,\n     Gray olive slopes of hills that hem\n     Thy tombs and shrines, Jerusalem,\n     Or startling on her desert throne\n     The crazy Queen of Lebanon s\n     With claims fantastic as her own,\n     Her tireless feet have held their way;\n     And still, unrestful, bowed, and gray,\n     She watches under Eastern skies,\n     With hope each day renewed and fresh,\n     The Lord's quick coming in the flesh,\n     Whereof she dreams and prophesies!\n\n     Where'er her troubled path may be,\n     The Lord's sweet pity with her go!\n     The outward wayward life we see,\n     The hidden springs we may not know.\n     Nor is it given us to discern\n     What threads the fatal sisters spun,\n     Through what ancestral years has run\n     The sorrow with the woman born,\n     What forged her cruel chain of moods,\n     What set her feet in solitudes,\n     And held the love within her mute,\n     What mingled madness in the blood,\n     A life-long discord and annoy,\n     Water of tears with oil of joy,\n     And hid within the folded bud\n     Perversities of flower and fruit.\n     It is not ours to separate\n     The tangled skein of will and fate,\n     To show what metes and bounds should stand\n     Upon the soul's debatable land,\n     And between choice and Providence\n     Divide the circle of events;\n     But lie who knows our frame is just,\n     Merciful and compassionate,\n     And full of sweet assurances\n     And hope for all the language is,\n     That He remembereth we are dust!\n\n     At last the great logs, crumbling low,\n     Sent out a dull and duller glow,\n     The bull's-eye watch that hung in view,\n     Ticking its weary circuit through,\n     Pointed with mutely warning sign\n     Its black hand to the hour of nine.\n     That sign the pleasant circle broke\n     My uncle ceased his pipe to smoke,\n     Knocked from its bowl the refuse gray,\n     And laid it tenderly away,\n     Then roused himself to safely cover\n     The dull red brands with ashes over.\n     And while, with care, our mother laid\n     The work aside, her steps she stayed\n     One moment, seeking to express\n     Her grateful sense of happiness\n     For food and shelter, warmth and health,\n     And love's contentment more than wealth,\n     With simple wishes (not the weak,\n     Vain prayers which no fulfilment seek,\n     But such as warm the generous heart,\n     O'er-prompt to do with Heaven its part)\n     That none might lack, that bitter night,\n     For bread and clothing, warmth and light.\n\n     Within our beds awhile we heard\n     The wind that round the gables roared,\n     With now and then a ruder shock,\n     Which made our very bedsteads rock.\n     We heard the loosened clapboards tost,\n     The board-nails snapping in the frost;\n     And on us, through the unplastered wall,\n     Felt the light sifted snow-flakes fall.\n     But sleep stole on, as sleep will do\n     When hearts are light and life is new;\n     Faint and more faint the murmurs grew,\n     Till in the summer-land of dreams\n     They softened to the sound of streams,\n     Low stir of leaves, and dip of oars,\n     And lapsing waves on quiet shores.\n\n     Next morn we wakened with the shout\n     Of merry voices high and clear;\n     And saw the teamsters drawing near\n     To break the drifted highways out.\n     Down the long hillside treading slow\n     We saw the half-buried oxen' go,\n     Shaking the snow from heads uptost,\n     Their straining nostrils white with frost.\n     Before our door the straggling train\n     Drew up, an added team to gain.\n     The elders threshed their hands a-cold,\n     Passed, with the cider-mug, their jokes\n     From lip to lip; the younger folks\n     Down the loose snow-banks, wrestling, rolled,\n     Then toiled again the cavalcade\n     O'er windy hill, through clogged ravine,\n     And woodland paths that wound between\n     Low drooping pine-boughs winter-weighed.\n     From every barn a team afoot,\n     At every house a new recruit,\n     Where, drawn by Nature's subtlest law\n     Haply the watchful young men saw\n     Sweet doorway pictures of the curls\n     And curious eyes of merry girls,\n     Lifting their hands in mock defence\n     Against the snow-ball's compliments,\n     And reading in each missive tost\n     The charm with Eden never lost.\n\n     We heard once more the sleigh-bells' sound;\n     And, following where the teamsters led,\n     The wise old Doctor went his round,\n     Just pausing at our door to say,\n     In the brief autocratic way\n     Of one who, prompt at Duty's call,\n     Was free to urge her claim on all,\n     That some poor neighbor sick abed\n     At night our mother's aid would need.\n     For, one in generous thought and deed,\n     What mattered in the sufferer's sight\n     The Quaker matron's inward light,\n     The Doctor's mail of Calvin's creed?\n     All hearts confess the saints elect\n     Who, twain in faith, in love agree,\n     And melt not in an acid sect\n     The Christian pearl of charity!\n\n     So days went on: a week had passed\n     Since the great world was heard from last.\n     The Almanac we studied o'er,\n     Read and reread our little store,\n     Of books and pamphlets, scarce a score;\n     One harmless novel, mostly hid\n     From younger eyes, a book forbid,\n     And poetry, (or good or bad,\n     A single book was all we had,)\n     Where Ellwood's meek, drab-skirted Muse,\n     A stranger to the heathen Nine,\n     Sang, with a somewhat nasal whine,\n     The wars of David and the Jews.\n     At last the floundering carrier bore\n     The village paper to our door.\n     Lo! broadening outward as we read,\n     To warmer zones the horizon spread;\n     In panoramic length unrolled\n     We saw the marvels that it told.\n     Before us passed the painted Creeks,\n     And daft McGregor on his raids\n     In Costa Rica's everglades.\n     And up Taygetos winding slow\n     Rode Ypsilanti's Mainote Greeks,\n     A Turk's head at each saddle-bow\n     Welcome to us its week-old news,\n     Its corner for the rustic Muse,\n     Its monthly gauge of snow and rain,\n     Its record, mingling in a breath\n     The wedding bell and dirge of death;\n     Jest, anecdote, and love-lorn tale,\n     The latest culprit sent to jail;\n     Its hue and cry of stolen and lost,\n     Its vendue sales and goods at cost,\n     And traffic calling loud for gain.\n     We felt the stir of hall and street,\n     The pulse of life that round us beat;\n     The chill embargo of the snow\n     Was melted in the genial glow;\n     Wide swung again our ice-locked door,\n     And all the world was ours once more!\n\n

shores,\n     Sped by sail or urged by oars\n     No keel had vexed it ever.\n\n     Alone the dead trees yielding\n     To the dull axe Time is wielding,\n     The shy mink and the otter,\n     And golden leaves and red,\n     By countless autumns shed,\n     Had floated down its water.\n\n     From the gray rocks of Cape Ann,\n     Came a skilled seafaring man,\n     With his dory, to the right place;\n     Over hill and plain he brought her,\n     Where the boatless Beareamp water\n     Comes winding down from White-Face.\n\n     Quoth the skipper: \"Ere she floats forth;\n     I'm sure my pretty boat's worth,\n     At least, a name as pretty.\"\n     On her painted side he wrote it,\n     And the flag that o'er her floated\n     Bore aloft the name of Jettie.\n\n     On a radiant morn of summer,\n     Elder guest and latest comer\n     Saw her wed the Bearcamp water;\n     Heard the name the skipper gave her,\n     And the answer to the favor\n     From the Bay State's graceful daughter.\n\n     Then, a singer, richly gifted,\n     Her charmed voice uplifted;\n     And the wood-thrush and song-sparrow\n     Listened, dumb with envious pain,\n     To the clear and sweet refrain\n     Whose notes they could not borrow.\n\n     Then the skipper plied his oar,\n     And from off the shelving shore,\n     Glided out the strange explorer;\n     Floating on, she knew not whither,--\n     The tawny sands beneath her,\n     The great hills watching o'er her.\n\n     On, where the stream flows quiet\n     As the meadows' margins by it,\n     Or widens out to borrow a\n     New life from that wild water,\n     The mountain giant's daughter,\n     The pine-besung Chocorua.\n\n     Or, mid the tangling cumber\n     And pack of mountain lumber\n     That spring floods downward force,\n     Over sunken snag, and bar\n     Where the grating shallows are,\n     The good boat held her course.\n\n     Under the pine-dark highlands,\n     Around the vine-hung islands,\n     She ploughed her crooked furrow\n     And her rippling and her lurches\n     Scared the river eels and perches,\n     And the musk-rat in his burrow.\n\n     Every sober clam below her,\n     Every sage and grave pearl-grower,\n     Shut his rusty valves the tighter;\n     Crow called to crow complaining,\n     And old tortoises sat craning\n     Their leathern necks to sight her.\n\n     So, to where the still lake glasses\n     The misty mountain masses\n     Rising dim and distant northward,\n     And, with faint-drawn shadow pictures,\n     Low shores, and dead pine spectres,\n     Blends the skyward and the earthward,\n\n     On she glided, overladen,\n     With merry man and maiden\n     Sending back their song and laughter,--\n     While, perchance, a phantom crew,\n     In a ghostly birch canoe,\n     Paddled dumb and swiftly after!\n\n     And the bear on Ossipee\n     Climbed the topmost crag to see\n     The strange thing drifting under;\n     And, through the haze of August,\n     Passaconaway and Paugus\n     Looked down in sleepy wonder.\n\n     All the pines that o'er her hung\n     In mimic sea-tones sung\n     The song familiar to her;\n     And the maples leaned to screen her,\n     And the meadow-grass seemed greener,\n     And the breeze more soft to woo her.\n\n     The lone stream mystery-haunted,\n     To her the freedom granted\n     To scan its every feature,\n     Till new and old were blended,\n     And round them both extended\n     The loving arms of Nature.\n\n     Of these hills the little vessel\n     Henceforth is part and parcel;\n

morning gladness\n     Of life, at evening time,\n     By chance, onlooking idly,\n     Apart from all so widely,\n     Have set her voyage to rhyme.\n\n     Dies now the gay persistence\n     Of song and laugh, in distance;\n     Alone with me remaining\n     The stream, the quiet meadow,\n     The hills in shine and shadow,\n     The sombre pines complaining.\n\n     And, musing here, I dream\n     Of voyagers on a stream\n     From whence is no returning,\n     Under sealed orders going,\n     Looking forward little knowing,\n     Looking back with idle yearning.\n\n     And I pray that every venture\n     The port of peace may enter,\n     That, safe from snag and fall\n     And siren-haunted islet,\n     And rock, the Unseen Pilot\n     May guide us one and all.", "MY TRUST": "     A

Abram Morrison.\n\n     When the Grist and Rolling Mill\n     Ground and rumbled by Po Hill,\n     And the old red school-house stood\n     Midway in the Powow's flood,\n     Here dwelt Abram

Morrison.\n\n     Mudknock, Balmawhistle, all\n     Only knew the Yankee drawl,\n     Never brogue was heard till when,\n     Foremost of his countrymen,\n     Hither came Friend Morrison;\n\n     Yankee born, of alien blood,\n     Kin of his had well withstood\n     Pope and King with pike and ball\n     Under Derry's leaguered wall,\n     As became the Morrisons.\n\n     Wandering down from Nutfield woods\n     With his household and his goods,\n     Never was it clearly told\n     How within our quiet fold\n     Came to be a Morrison.\n\n     Once a soldier, blame him not\n     That the Quaker he forgot,\n     When, to think of battles won,\n     And the red-coats on the run,\n     Laughed aloud Friend Morrison.\n\n     From gray Lewis over sea\n     Bore his sires their family tree,\n     On the rugged boughs of it\n     Grafting Irish mirth and wit,\n     And the brogue of Morrison.\n\n     Half a genius, quick to plan,\n     Blundering like an Irishman,\n     But with canny shrewdness lent\n     By his far-off Scotch descent,\n     Such was Abram Morrison.\n\n     Back and forth to daily meals,\n     Rode his cherished pig on wheels,\n     And to all who came to see\n     \"Aisier for the pig an' me,\n     Sure it is,\" said Morrison.\n\n     Simple-hearted, boy o'er-grown,\n     With a humor quite his own,\n     Of our sober-stepping ways,\n     Speech and look and cautious phrase,\n     Slow to learn was Morrison.\n\n     Much we loved his stories told\n     Of a country strange and old,\n     Where the fairies danced till dawn,\n     And the goblin Leprecaun\n     Looked, we thought, like Morrison.\n\n     Or wild tales of feud and fight,\n     Witch and troll and second sight\n     Whispered still where Stornoway\n     Looks across its stormy bay,\n     Once the home of Morrisons.\n\n     First was he to sing the praise\n     Of the Powow's winding ways;\n     And our straggling village took\n     City grandeur to the look\n     Of its poet Morrison.\n\n     All his words have perished.

   We are wiser now, perhaps,\n     But we miss our streets amid\n     Something which the past has hid,\n     Lost with Abram Morrison.\n\n     Gone forever with the queer\n     Characters of that

face, that simple flower\n     The lines of sin and sadness swept;\n     And Magian pile and Paynim bower\n     In peace like that of Eden slept.\n\n     Each Moslem tomb, and cypress old,\n     Looked holy through the sunset air;\n     And, angel-like, the Muezzin told\n     From tower and mosque the hour of prayer.\n\n     With cheerful steps, the morrow's dawn\n     From Shiraz saw the

outlined\n     From myself the fear has grown,\n     And the shadow is my own.\n\n     Yet, O Lord, through all a sense\n     Of Thy tender providence\n     Stays my failing heart on Thee,\n     And confirms the feeble knee;\n     And, at times, my worn feet press\n     Spaces of cool quietness,\n     Lilied whiteness shone upon\n     Not by light of moon or sun.\n     Hours there be of inmost calm,\n     Broken but by grateful psalm,\n     When I love Thee more than fear Thee,\n     And Thy blessed Christ seems near me,\n     With forgiving look, as when\n     He beheld the Magdalen.\n     Well I know that all things move\n     To the spheral rhythm of love,--\n     That to Thee, O Lord of all!\n     Nothing can of chance befall\n     Child and seraph, mote and star,\n     Well Thou knowest what we are\n     Through Thy vast creative plan\n     Looking, from the worm to man,\n     There is pity in Thine eyes,\n     But no hatred nor surprise.\n     Not in blind caprice of will,\n     Not in cunning sleight of skill,\n     Not for show of power, was wrought\n     Nature's marvel in Thy thought.\n     Never careless hand and vain\n     Smites these chords of joy and pain;\n     No immortal selfishness\n     Plays the game of curse and bless\n     Heaven and earth are witnesses\n     That Thy glory goodness is.\n\n     Not for sport of mind and force\n     Hast Thou made Thy universe,\n     But as atmosphere and zone\n     Of Thy loving heart alone.\n     Man, who walketh in a show,\n     Sees before him, to and fro,\n     Shadow and illusion go;\n     All things flow and fluctuate,\n     Now contract and now dilate.\n     In the welter of this sea,\n     Nothing stable is but Thee;\n     In this whirl of swooning trance,\n     Thou alone art permanence;\n     All without Thee only seems,\n     All beside is choice of dreams.\n     Never yet in darkest mood\n     Doubted I that Thou wast good,\n     Nor mistook my will for fate,\n     Pain of sin for heavenly hate,--\n     Never dreamed the gates of pearl\n     Rise from out the burning marl,\n     Or that good can only live\n     Of the bad conservative,\n     And through counterpoise of hell\n     Heaven alone be possible.\n\n     For myself alone I doubt;\n     All is well, I know, without;\n     I alone the beauty mar,\n     I alone the music jar.\n     Yet, with hands by evil stained,\n     And an ear by discord pained,\n     I am groping for the keys\n     Of the heavenly harmonies;\n     Still within my heart I bear\n     Love for all things good and fair.\n     Hands of want or souls in pain\n     Have not sought my door in vain;\n     I have kept my fealty good\n     To the human brotherhood;\n     Scarcely have I asked in prayer\n     That which others might not share.\n     I, who hear with secret shame\n     Praise that paineth more than blame,\n     Rich alone in favors lent,\n     Virtuous by accident,\n     Doubtful where I fain would rest,\n     Frailest where I seem the best,\n     Only strong for lack of test,--\n     What am I, that I should press\n     Special pleas of selfishness,\n     Coolly mounting into heaven\n     On my neighbor unforgiven?\n     Ne'er to me, howe'er disguised,\n     Comes a saint unrecognized;\n     Never fails my heart to greet\n     Noble deed with warmer beat;\n     Halt and maimed, I own not less\n     All the grace of holiness;\n     Nor, through shame or self-distrust,\n     Less I love the pure and just.\n     Lord, forgive these words of mine\n     What have I that is not Thine?\n     Whatsoe'er I fain would boast\n     Needs Thy pitying pardon most.\n     Thou, O Elder Brother! who\n     In Thy flesh our trial knew,\n     Thou, who hast been touched by these\n     Our most sad infirmities,\n     Thou alone the gulf canst span\n     In the dual heart of man,\n     And between the soul and sense\n     Reconcile all difference,\n     Change the dream of me and mine\n     For the truth of Thee and Thine,\n     And, through chaos, doubt, and strife,\n     Interfuse Thy calm of life.\n     Haply, thus by Thee renewed,\n     In Thy borrowed goodness good,\n     Some sweet morning yet in God's\n     Dim, veonian periods,\n     Joyful I shall wake to see\n     Those I love who rest in Thee,\n     And to them in Thee allied\n     Shall my soul be satisfied.\n\n     Scarcely Hope hath shaped for me\n     What the future life may be.\n     Other lips may well be bold;\n     Like the publican of old,\n     I can only urge the plea,\n     \"Lord, be merciful to me!\"\n     Nothing of desert I claim,\n     Unto me belongeth shame.\n     Not for me the crowns of gold,\n     Palms, and harpings manifold;\n     Not for erring eye and feet\n     Jasper wall and golden street.\n     What thou wilt, O Father, give I\n     All is gain that I receive.\n\n     If my voice I may not raise\n     In the elders' song of praise,\n     If I may not, sin-defiled,\n     Claim my birthright as a child,\n     Suffer it that I to Thee\n     As an hired servant be;\n     Let the lowliest task be mine,\n     Grateful, so the work be Thine;\n     Let me find the humblest place\n     In the shadow of Thy grace\n     Blest to me were any spot\n     Where temptation whispers not.\n     If there be some weaker one,\n     Give me strength to help him on\n     If a blinder soul there be,\n     Let me guide him nearer Thee.\n     Make my mortal dreams come true\n     With the work I fain would do;\n     Clothe with life the weak intent,\n     Let me be the thing I meant;\n     Let me find in Thy employ\n     Peace that dearer is than joy;\n     Out of self to love be led\n     And to heaven acclimated,\n     Until all things sweet and good\n     Seem my natural habitude.\n\n          .    .    .    .\n\n     So
