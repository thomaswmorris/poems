{"OPUSCULUM": "Fair Cousin, thy page\nis small to encage\nthe thoughts which engage\nthe mind of a sage,\nsuch as I am;\n\n'Twere in teaspoon to take\nthe whole Genevese lake,\nor a lap-dog to make\nthe white Elephant sac-\n-red in Siam.\n\nYet inadequate though\nto the terms strange and so-\n-lemn that figure in po-\n-lysyllabical row\nin a treatise; \n\nStill, true words and plain,\nof the heart, not the brain,\nin affectionate strain,\nthis book to contain\nvery meet is.\n\nSo I promise to be\na good Cousin to thee,\nand to keep safe the se-\n-cret I heard, although e-\n-v'ry one know it;\n\nWith a lyrical air\nmy kind thoughts I would dare,\nand offer whate'er\nbeseems the news, were\nI a poet.", "LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT": " Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,\n      Lead thou me on!\n  The night is dark, and I am far from home,--\n      Lead thou me on!\n  Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see\n  The distant scene,--one step enough for me.\n\n  I was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou\n      Shouldst lead me on:\n  I loved to choose and see my path, but now\n      Lead thou me on!\n  I loved the garish days, and, spite of fears,\n  Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.\n\n  So long thy power hath blessed me, sure it still\n    Will lead me on;\n  O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till\n    The night is gone;\n  And with the morn those angel faces smile\n  Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.", "ENGLAND": "Type of the West, and glorying in the name\nMore than in Faith's pure fame!\nOh. trust not crafty fort nor rock renowned\nEarned upon hostile ground;\nWielding Trade's master-keys, at thy proud will\nTo lock or loose its waters, England! trust not still.\n\nDread thine own power! Since haughty Babel's prime,\nHigh towers have been man's crime.\nSince her hoar age, when the huge moat lay bare,\nStrongholds have been man's snare.\nThy nest is in the crags; ah, refuge frail!\nMad counsel in its hour, or traitors, will prevail.\n\nHe who scanned Sodom for His righteous men\nStill spares thee for thy ten;\nBut, should vain tongues the Bride of Heaven defy,\nHe will not pass thee by;\nFor, as earth's kings welcome their spotless guest,\nSo gives He them by turn, to suffer or be blest.", "THE ELEMENTS": "MAN is permitted much \nTo scan and learn \nIn Nature\u2019s frame; \nTill he well-nigh can tame \nBrute mischiefs, and can touch \nInvisible things, and turn \nAll warring ills to purposes of good. \nThus, as a god below, \nHe can control, \nAnd harmonize, what seems amiss to flow \nAs sever\u2019d from the whole \nAnd dimly understood. \n\nBut o\u2019er the elements \nOne Hand alone, \nOne Hand has sway.\nWhat influence day by day \nIn straiter belt prevents \nThe impious Ocean, thrown \nAlternate o\u2019er the ever-sounding shore? \nOr who has eye to trace\nHow the Plague came? \nForerun the doublings of the Tempest\u2019s race? \nOr the Air\u2019s weight and flame \nOn a set scale explore? \n\nThus God has will\u2019d\nThat man, when fully skill\u2019d, \nStill gropes in twilight dim; \nEncompass\u2019d all his hours \nBy fearfullest powers \nInflexible to him.\nThat so he may discern \nHis feebleness, \nAnd e\u2019en for earth\u2019s success \nTo Him in wisdom turn, \nWho holds for us the keys of either home,\nEarth and the world to come.", "metadata": "newman|St. John Henry Newman|1801|1890|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Newman"}
