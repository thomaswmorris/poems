{"RETURNING NATIVE": "What can you say about Pennsylvania \nin regard to New England except that \nit is slightly less cold, and less rocky, \nor rather that the rocks are different? \nRedder, and gritty, and piled up here and there, \nwhether as glacial moraine or collapsed springhouse \nis not easy to tell, so quickly \nare human efforts bundled back into nature. \n\nIn fall, the trees turn yellower--\nhard maple, hickory, and oak \ngive way to tulip poplar, black walnut, \nand locust. The woods are overgrown \nwith wild-grape vines, and with greenbrier \nspreading its low net of anxious small claws. \nIn warm November, the mulching forest floor \nsmells like a rotting animal. \n\nA genial pulpiness, in short: the sky \nis soft with haze and paper-gray \neven as the sun shines, and the rain \nfalls soft on the shoulders of farmers \nwhile the children keep on playing, \ntheir heads of hair beaded like spider webs. \nA deep-dyed blur softens the bleak cities \nwhose people palaver in prolonged vowels. \n\nThere is a secret here, some death-defying joke \nthe eyes, the knuckles, the bellies imply--\na suet of consolation fetched straight \nfrom the slaughterhouse and hung out \nfor chickadees to peck in the lee of the spruce, \nwhere the husks of sunflower seeds \nand the peace-signs of bird feet crowd \nthe snow that barely masks the still-green grass. \n\nI knew that secret once, and have forgotten. \nThe death-defying secret\u2014it rises \ntoward me like a dog's gaze, loving \nbut bewildered.

Then \nI loved them better than my ears, \nMy elbows, adenoids, and heart. \nBut with the swelling of the years \nWe drifted, toes and I, apart. \nNow, gnarled and pale, each said, j'accuse!--\nI hid them quickly in my shoes.", "PURA VIDA": "Such heat!
