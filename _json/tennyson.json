Life piled on life \nWere all too little, and of one to me \nLittle remains: but every hour is saved \nFrom that eternal silence, something more, \nA bringer of new things; and vile it were \nFor some three suns to store and hoard myself, \nAnd this gray spirit yearning in desire \nTo follow knowledge like a sinking star, \nBeyond the utmost bound of human thought. \n\n         This is my son, mine own Telemachus, \nTo whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,\u2014 \nWell-loved of me, discerning to fulfil \nThis labour, by slow prudence to make mild \nA rugged people, and thro' soft degrees \nSubdue them to the useful and the good. \nMost blameless is he, centred in the sphere \nOf common duties, decent not to fail \nIn offices of tenderness, and pay \nMeet adoration to my household gods, \nWhen I am gone. He works his work, I mine. \n\n         There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail: \nThere gloom the dark, broad seas.

Come, my friends, \n'T is not too late to seek a newer world. \nPush off, and sitting well in order smite \nThe sounding furrows; for my purpose holds \nTo sail beyond the sunset, and the baths \nOf all the western stars, until I die. \nIt may be that the gulfs will wash us down: \nIt may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, \nAnd see the great Achilles, whom we knew. \nTho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' \nWe are not now that strength which in old days \nMoved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; \nOne equal temper of heroic hearts, \nMade weak by time and fate, but strong in will \nTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.", "THE HIGHER PANTHEISM": "The sun, the moon, the stars, the seas, the hills and the plains,- \nAre not these, O Soul, the Vision of Him who reigns? \n\nIs not the Vision He, tho' He be not that which He seems? \nDreams are true while they last, and do we not live in dreams? \n\nEarth, these solid stars, this weight of body and limb, \nAre they not sign and symbol of thy division from Him? \n\nDark is the world to thee; thyself art the reason why, \nFor is He not all but thou, that hast power to feel \"I am I\"? \n\nGlory about thee, without thee; and thou fulfillest thy doom, \nMaking Him broken gleams and a stifled splendour and gloom. \n\nSpeak to Him, thou, for He hears, and Spirit with Spirit can meet- \nCloser is He than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet. \n\nGod is law, say the wise; O soul, and let us rejoice, \nFor if He thunder by law the thunder is yet His voice. \n\nLaw is God, say some; no God at all, says the fool, \nFor all we have power to see is a straight staff bent in a pool; \n\nAnd the ear of man cannot hear, and the eye of man cannot see; \nBut if we could see and hear, this Vision-were it not He?
