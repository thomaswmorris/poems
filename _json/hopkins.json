Then what,\n   What have we seen? Her head, sheared from her shoulders,\n     fall,\n   And lapped in shining hair, roll to the bank's edge; then\n   Down the beetling banks, like water in waterfalls,\n   It stooped and flashed and fell and ran like water away.\n   Her eyes, oh and her eyes!\n   In all her beauty, and sunlight to it is a pit, den, darkness,\n   Foam-falling is not fresh to it, rainbow by it not beaming,\n   In all her body, I say, no place was like her eyes,\n   No piece matched those eyes kept most part much cast down\n   But, being lifted, immortal, of immortal brightness.\n   Several times I saw them, thrice or four times turning;\n   Round and round they came and flashed towards heaven:\n     O there,\n   There they did appeal.

Only resolution; will, his will unwavering\n   Who, like me, knowing his nature to the heart home,\n     nature's business,\n   Despatches with no flinching. But will flesh, O can flesh\n   Second this fiery strain? Not always; O no no!\n   We cannot live this life out; sometimes we must weary\n   And in this darksome world what comfort can I find?\n   Down this darksome world c\u00f3mfort wh\u00e9re can I find\n   When 'ts light I quenched; its rose, time's one rich rose,\n     my hand,\n   By her bloom, fast by her fresh, her fleec\u00e8d bloom,\n   Hideous dashed down, leaving earth a winter withering\n   With no now, no Gwenvrewi.

No more: off with--\n     down he dings\nHis bleach\u00e8d both and woolwoven wear:\nCareless these in coloured wisp\nAll lie tumbled-to; then with loop-locks\nForward falling, forehead frowning, lips crisp\nOver finger-teasing task, his twiny boots\nFast he opens, last he offwrings\nTill walk the world he can with bare his feet\nAnd come where lies a coffer, burly all of blocks\nBuilt of chancequarri\u00e8d, selfquain\u00e8d rocks\nAnd the water warbles over into, filleted with glassy grassy\n     quicksilvery shiv\u00e8s and shoots\nAnd with heavenfallen freshness down from moorland still brims,\nDark or daylight on and on. Here he will then, here he will\n     the fleet\nFlinty kindcold element let break across his limbs\nLong. Where we leave him, froliclavish while he looks about\n     him, laughs, swims.\n\nEnough now; since the sacred matter that I mean\nI should be wronging longer leaving it to float\nUpon this only gambolling and echoing-of-earth note--\nWhat is ... the delightful dene?\nWedlock. What the water?
