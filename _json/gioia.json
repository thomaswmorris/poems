{"CALIFORNIA HILLS IN AUGUST": "I can imagine someone who found\nthese fields unbearable, who climbed\nthe hillside in the heat, cursing the dust,\ncracking the brittle weeds underfoot,\nwishing a few more trees for shade.\n \nAn Easterner especially, who would scorn\nthe meagerness of summer, the dry\ntwisted shapes of black elm,\nscrub oak, and chaparral, a landscape\nAugust has already drained of green.\n \nOne who would hurry over the clinging\nthistle, foxtail, golden poppy,\nknowing everything was just a weed,\nunable to conceive that these trees\nand sparse brown bushes were alive.\n \nAnd hate the bright stillness of the noon\nwithout wind, without motion,\nthe only other living thing\na hawk, hungry for prey, suspended\nin the blinding, sunlit blue.\n \nAnd yet how gentle it seems to someone\nraised in a landscape short of rain--\nthe skyline of a hill broken by no more\ntrees than one can count, the grass,\nthe empty sky, the wish for water.", "metadata": "gioia|Dana Gioia|1950||https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Gioia"}
