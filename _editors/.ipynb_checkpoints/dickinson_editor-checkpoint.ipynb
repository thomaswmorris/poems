      "With scorning laughter at a fellow writer,In a chorus the Russian scribesWith name of aristocrat me chide:Just look, if please you ... nonsense what!Court Coachman not I, nor assessor,Nor am I nobleman by cross;No academician, nor professor,I'm simply of Russia a citizen.\n",
      "Well I know the times' corruption,And, surely, not gainsay it shall I:Our nobility but recent is:The more recent it, the more noble 't is.But of humbled races a chip,And, God be thanked, not aloneOf ancient Lords am scion I;Citizen I am, a citizen!\n",
      "Not in cakes my grandsire traded,Not a prince was newly-baked he;Nor at church sang he in choir,Nor polished he the boots of Tsar;Was not escaped a soldier heFrom the German powdered ranks;How then aristocrat am I to be?God be thanked, I am but a citizen.\n",
      "My grandsire Radsha in warlike serviceTo Alexander Nefsky was attached.The Crowned Wrathful, Fourth Ivan,His descendants in his ire had spared.About the Tsars the Pushkins moved;And more than one acquired renown,When against the Poles battling wasOf Nizhny Novgorod the citizen plain.\n",
      "When treason conquered was and falsehood,And the rage of storm of war,When the Romanoffs upon the throneThe nation called by its Chart--We upon it laid our hands;The martyr's son then favored us;Time was, our race was prized,But I ... am but a citizen obscure.\n",
      "Our stubborn spirit us tricks has played;Most irrepressible of his race,With Peter my sire could not get on;And for this was hung by him.Let his example a lesson be:Not contradiction loves a ruler,Not all can be Prince Dolgorukys,Happy only is the simple citizen.\n",
      "My grandfather, when the rebels roseIn the palace of Peterhof,Like Munich, faithful he remainedTo the fallen Peter Third;To honor came then the Orloffs,But my sire into fortress, prison--Quiet now was our stern race,And I was born merely--citizen.\n",
      "Beneath my crested sealThe roll of family charts I've kept;Not running after magnates new,My pride of blood I have subdued;I'm but an unknown singerSimply Pushkin, not Moussin,My strength is mine, not from court:I am a writer, a citizen.\n",
