Ancient was the race;\\n\\t     To trace the upward stem of proud Lusace\\n\\t     Gives one a vertigo; descended they\\n\\t     From ancestor of Attila, men say;\\n\\t     Their race to him--through Pagans--they hark back;\\n\\t     Becoming Christians, race they thought to track\\n\\t     Through Lechus, Plato, Otho to combine\\n\\t     With Ursus, Stephen, in a lordly line.\\n\\t     Of all those masters of the country round\\n\\t     That were on Northern Europe\\'s boundary found--\\n\\t     At first were waves and then the dykes were reared--\\n\\t     Corbus in double majesty appeared,\\n\\t     Castle on hill and town upon the plain;\\n\\t     And one who mounted on the tower could gain\\n\\t     A view beyond the pines and rocks, of spires\\n\\t     That pierce the shade the distant scene acquires;\\n\\t     A walled town is it, but \\'tis not ally\\n\\t     Of the old citadel\\'s proud majesty;\\n\\t     Unto itself belonging this remained.\\n\\t     Often a castle was thus self-sustained\\n\\t     And equalled towns; witness in Lombardy\\n\\t     Crama, and Plato too in Tuscany,\\n\\t     And in Apulia Barletta;--each one\\n\\t     Was powerful as a town, and dreaded none.\\n\\t     Corbus ranked thus; its precincts seemed to hold\\n\\t     The reflex of its mighty kings of old;\\n\\t     Their great events had witness in these walls,\\n\\t     Their marriages were here and funerals,\\n\\t     And mostly here it was that they were born;\\n\\t     And here crowned Barons ruled with pride and scorn;\\n\\t     Cradle of Scythian majesty this place.\\n\\t     Now each new master of this ancient race\\n\\t     A duty owed to ancestors which he\\n\\t     Was bound to carry on. The law\\'s decree\\n\\t     It was that he should pass alone the night\\n\\t     Which made him king, as in their solemn sight.\\n\\t     Just at the forest\\'s edge a clerk was met\\n\\t     With wine in sacred cup and purpose set,\\n\\t     A wine mysterious, which the heir must drink\\n\\t     To cause deep slumber till next day\\'s soft brink.\\n\\t     Then to the castle tower he wends his way,\\n\\t     And finds a supper laid with rich display.\\n\\t     He sups and sleeps: then to his slumbering eyes\\n\\t     The shades of kings from Bela all arise.\\n\\t     None dare the tower to enter on this night,\\n\\t     But when the morning dawns, crowds are in sight\\n\\t     The dreamer to deliver,--whom half dazed,\\n\\t     And with the visions of the night amazed,\\n\\t     They to the old church take, where rests the dust\\n\\t     Of Borivorus; then the bishop must,\\n\\t     With fervent blessings on his eyes and mouth,\\n\\t     Put in his hands the stony hatchets both,\\n\\t     With which--even like death impartially--\\n\\t     Struck Attila, with one arm dexterously\\n\\t     The south, and with the other arm the north.\\n\\n\\t     This day the town the threatening flag set forth\\n\\t     Of Marquis Swantibore, the monster he\\n\\t     Who in the wood tied up his wife, to be\\n\\t     Devoured by wolves, together with the bull\\n\\t     Of which with jealousy his heart was full.\\n\\n\\t     Even when woman took the place of heir\\n\\t     The tower of Corbus claimed the supper there;\\n\\t     \\'Twas law--the woman trembled, but must dare.\\n\\n\\t     V.\\n\\n\\t     THE MARCHIONESS MAHAUD.\\n\\n\\t     Niece of the Marquis--John the Striker named--\\n\\t     Mahaud to-day the marquisate has claimed.\\n\\t     A noble dame--the crown is hers by right:\\n\\t     As woman she has graces that delight.\\n\\t     A queen devoid of beauty is not queen,\\n\\t     She needs the royalty of beauty\\'s mien;\\n\\t     God in His harmony has equal ends\\n\\t     For cedar that resists, and reed that bends,\\n\\t     And good it is a woman sometimes rules,\\n\\t     Holds in her hand the power, and manners schools,\\n\\t     And laws and mind;--succeeding master proud,\\n\\t     With gentle voice and smile she leads the crowd,\\n\\t     The sombre human troop. But sweet Mahaud\\n\\t     On evil days had fallen; gentle, good,\\n\\t     Alas! she held the sceptre like a flower;\\n\\t     Timid yet gay, imprudent for the hour,\\n\\t     And careless too. With Europe all in throes,\\n\\t     Though twenty years she now already knows,\\n\\t     She has refused to marry, although oft\\n\\t     Entreated. It is time an arm less soft\\n\\t     Than hers--a manly arm--supported her;\\n\\t     Like to the rainbow she, one might aver,\\n\\t     Shining on high between the cloud and rain,\\n\\t     Or like the ewe that gambols on the plain\\n\\t     Between the bear and tiger; innocent,\\n\\t     She has two neighbors of most foul intent:\\n\\t     For foes the Beauty has, in life\\'s pure spring,\\n\\t     The German Emp\\'ror and the Polish King.\\n\\n\\t     VI.\\n\\n\\t     THE TWO NEIGHBORS.\\n\\n\\t     The difference this betwixt the evil pair,\\n\\t     Faithless to God--for laws without a care--\\n\\t     One was the claw, the other one the will\\n\\t     Controlling. Yet to mass they both went still,\\n\\t     And on the rosary told their beads each day.\\n\\t     But none the less the world believed that they\\n\\t     Unto the powers of hell their souls had sold.\\n\\t     Even in whispers men each other told\\n\\t     The details of the pact which they had signed\\n\\t     With that dark power, the foe of human kind;\\n\\t     In whispers, for the crowd had mortal dread\\n\\t     Of them so high, and woes that they had spread.\\n\\t     One might be vengeance and the other hate,\\n\\t     Yet lived they side by side, in powerful state\\n\\t     And close alliance. All the people near\\n\\t     From red horizon dwelt in abject fear,\\n\\t     Mastered by them; their figures darkly grand\\n\\t     Had ruddy reflex from the wasted land,\\n\\t     And fires, and towns they sacked. Besides the one,\\n\\t     Like David, poet was, the other shone\\n\\t     As fine musician--rumor spread their fame,\\n\\t     Declaring them divine, until each name\\n\\t     In Italy\\'s fine sonnets met with praise.\\n\\t     The ancient hierarch in those old days\\n\\t     Had custom strange, a now forgotten thing,\\n\\t     It was a European plan that King\\n\\t     Of France was marquis, and th\\' imperial head\\n\\t     Of Germany was duke; there was no need\\n\\t     To class the other kings, but barons they,\\n\\t     Obedient vassals unto Rome, their stay.\\n\\t     The King of Poland was but simple knight,\\n\\t     Yet now, for once, had strange unwonted right,\\n\\t     And, as exception to the common state,\\n\\t     This one Sarmatian King was held as great\\n\\t     As German Emperor; and each knew how\\n\\t     His evil part to play, nor mercy show.\\n\\t     The German had one aim, it was to take\\n\\t     All land he could, and it his own to make.\\n\\t     The Pole already having Baltic shore,\\n\\t     Seized Celtic ports, still needing more and more.\\n\\t     On all the Northern Sea his crafts roused fear:\\n\\t     Iceland beheld his demon navy near.\\n\\t     Antwerp the German burnt; and Prussias twain\\n\\t     Bowed to the yoke. The Polish King was fain\\n\\t     To help the Russian Spotocus--his aid\\n\\t     Was like the help that in their common trade\\n\\t     A sturdy butcher gives a weaker one.\\n\\t     The King it is who seizes, and this done,\\n\\t     The Emp\\'ror pillages, usurping right\\n\\t     In war Teutonic, settled but by might.\\n\\t     The King in Jutland cynic footing gains,\\n\\t     The weak coerced, the while with cunning pains\\n\\t     The strong are duped.

Rivers too personified\\n\\t     Appear--the Rhine as by the Meuse betrayed,\\n\\t     And fading groups of Odin in the shade,\\n\\t     And the wolf Fenrir and the Asgard snake.\\n\\t     One might the place for dragons\\' stable take.\\n\\t     The only lights that in the shed appear\\n\\t     Spring from the table\\'s giant chandelier\\n\\t     With seven iron branches--brought from hell\\n\\t     By Attila Archangel, people tell,\\n\\t     When he had conquered Mammon--and they say\\n\\t     That seven souls were the first flames that day.\\n\\t     This banquet hall looks an abyss outlined\\n\\t     With shadowy vagueness, though indeed we find\\n\\t     In the far depth upon the table spread\\n\\t     A sudden, strong, and glaring light is shed,\\n\\t     Striking upon the goldsmith\\'s burnished works,\\n\\t     And on the pheasants killed by traitor hawks.\\n\\t     Loaded the table is with viands cold,\\n\\t     Ewers and flagons, all enough of old\\n\\t     To make a love feast. All the napery\\n\\t     Was Friesland\\'s famous make; and fair to see\\n\\t     The dishes, silver-gilt and bordered round\\n\\t     With flowers; for fruit, here strawberries were found\\n\\t     And citrons, apples too, and nectarines.\\n\\t     The wooden bowls were carved in cunning lines\\n\\t     By peasants of the Murg, whose skilful hands\\n\\t     With patient toil reclaim the barren lands\\n\\t     And make their gardens flourish on a rock,\\n\\t     Or mountain where we see the hunters flock.\\n\\t     Gold fountain-cup, with handles Florentine,\\n\\t     Shows Acteons horned, though armed and booted fine,\\n\\t     Who fight with sword in hand against the hounds.\\n\\t     Roses and gladioles make up bright mounds\\n\\t     Of flowers, with juniper and aniseed;\\n\\t     While sage, all newly cut for this great need,\\n\\t     Covers the Persian carpet that is spread\\n\\t     Beneath the table, and so helps to shed\\n\\t     Around a perfume of the balmy spring.\\n\\t     Beyond is desolation withering.\\n\\t     One hears within the hollow dreary space\\n\\t     Across the grove, made fresh by summer\\'s grace,\\n\\t     The wind that ever is with mystic might\\n\\t     A spirit ripple of the Infinite.\\n\\t     The glass restored to frames to creak is made\\n\\t     By blustering wind that comes from neighboring glade.\\n\\t     Strange in this dream-like place, so drear and lone,\\n\\t     The guest expected should be living one!\\n\\t     The seven lights from seven arms make glow\\n\\t     Almost with life the staring eyes that show\\n\\t     On the dim frescoes--and along the walls\\n\\t     Is here and there a stool, or the light falls\\n\\t     O\\'er some long chest, with likeness to a tomb.\\n\\t     Yet was displayed amid the mournful gloom\\n\\t     Some copper vessels, and some crockery ware.\\n\\t     The door--as if it must, yet scarcely dare--\\n\\t     Had opened widely to the night\\'s fresh air.\\n\\n\\t     No voice is heard, for man has fled the place;\\n\\t     But Terror crouches in the corners\\' space,\\n\\t     And waits the coming guest. This banquet hall\\n\\t     Of Titans is so high, that he who shall\\n\\t     With wandering eye look up from beam to beam\\n\\t     Of the confused wild roof will haply seem\\n\\t     To wonder that the stars he sees not there.\\n\\t     Giants the spiders are, that weave with care\\n\\t     Their hideous webs, which float the joists amid,\\n\\t     Joists whose dark ends in griffins\\' jaws are hid.\\n\\t     The light is lurid, and the air like death,\\n\\t     And dark and foul. Even Night holds its breath\\n\\t     Awhile. One might suppose the door had fear\\n\\t     To move its double leaves--their noise to hear.\\n\\n\\t     VIII.\\n\\n\\t     WHAT MORE WAS TO BE SEEN.\\n\\n\\t     But the great hall of generations dead\\n\\t     Has something more sepulchral and more dread\\n\\t     Than lurid glare from seven-branched chandelier\\n\\t     Or table lone with stately daïs near--\\n\\t     Two rows of arches o\\'er a colonnade\\n\\t     With knights on horseback all in mail arrayed,\\n\\t     Each one disposed with pillar at his back\\n\\t     And to another vis-à-vis.

      "Well I know the times' corruption,And, surely, not gainsay it shall I:Our nobility but recent is:The more recent it, the more noble 't is.But of humbled races a chip,And, God be thanked, not aloneOf ancient Lords am scion I;Citizen I am, a citizen!\n",

      "Our stubborn spirit us tricks has played;Most irrepressible of his race,With Peter my sire could not get on;And for this was hung by him.Let his example a lesson be:Not contradiction loves a ruler,Not all can be Prince Dolgorukys,Happy only is the simple citizen.\n",
      "My grandfather, when the rebels roseIn the palace of Peterhof,Like Munich, faithful he remainedTo the fallen Peter Third;To honor came then the Orloffs,But my sire into fortress, prison--Quiet now was our stern race,And I was born merely--citizen.\n",
      "Beneath my crested sealThe roll of family charts I've kept;Not running after magnates new,My pride of blood I have subdued;I'm but an unknown singerSimply Pushkin, not Moussin,My strength is mine, not from court:I am a writer, a citizen.\n",
