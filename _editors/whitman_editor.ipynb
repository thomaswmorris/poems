      "Well I know the times' corruption,And, surely, not gainsay it shall I:Our nobility but recent is:The more recent it, the more noble 't is.But of humbled races a chip,And, God be thanked, not aloneOf ancient Lords am scion I;Citizen I am, a citizen!\n",

      "Our stubborn spirit us tricks has played;Most irrepressible of his race,With Peter my sire could not get on;And for this was hung by him.Let his example a lesson be:Not contradiction loves a ruler,Not all can be Prince Dolgorukys,Happy only is the simple citizen.\n",
      "My grandfather, when the rebels roseIn the palace of Peterhof,Like Munich, faithful he remainedTo the fallen Peter Third;To honor came then the Orloffs,But my sire into fortress, prison--Quiet now was our stern race,And I was born merely--citizen.\n",
