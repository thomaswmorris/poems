      "Our stubborn spirit us tricks has played;Most irrepressible of his race,With Peter my sire could not get on;And for this was hung by him.Let his example a lesson be:Not contradiction loves a ruler,Not all can be Prince Dolgorukys,Happy only is the simple citizen.\n",
      "My grandfather, when the rebels roseIn the palace of Peterhof,Like Munich, faithful he remainedTo the fallen Peter Third;To honor came then the Orloffs,But my sire into fortress, prison--Quiet now was our stern race,And I was born merely--citizen.\n",

      "Tormented by the thirst for the spiritI was dragging myself in a sombre desert,And a six-winged seraph appearedUnto me on the parting of the roads.With fingers as light as a dreamMine eyes he touched:And mine eyes opened wiseLike the eyes of a frightened eagle;He touched mine ears,And they filled with din and ringing.And I heard the trembling of the heavensAnd the flight of the angel's wings,And the creeping of the polyps in the sea,And the growth of the vine in the valley.And he took hold of my lips,And out he tore my sinful tongueWith its empty and false speech.And the fang of the wise serpentBetween my terrified lips he placedWith bloody hand.And ope he cut with sword my breast,And out he took my trembling heart,And a coal with flaming blazeInto the opened breast he shoved.Like a corpse I lay in the desert.And the voice of God unto me called:Arise, O prophet, and listen, and guide.Be thou filled with my will,And going over land and seaFire with the word the hearts of men!\n",

      "On a rainy autumn eveningInto desert places went a maid;And the secret fruit of unhappy loveIn her trembling hands she held.All was still: the hills and the woodsAsleep in the darkness of the night.And her searching glancesIn terror about she cast.\n",
      "And on this babe, the innocent,Her glance she paused with a sigh:Asleep thou art, my child, my grief.Thou knowest not my sadness.Thine eyes will ope, and tho' with longing,To my breast shalt no more cling.No kiss for thee to-morrowFrom thine unhappy mother.\n",
      "Beckon in vain for her thou wilt,My everlasting shame, my guilt!Me forget thou shalt for aye,But thee forget shall not I.Shelter thou shalt receive from strangers,Who 'll say: Thou art none of ours!Thou wilt ask, Where are my parents?But for thee no kin is found!\n",
      "Hapless one! With heart filled with sorrow,Lonely amid thy mates,Thy spirit sullen to the end,Thou shalt behold fondling mothers.A lonely wanderer everywhereCursing thy fate at all times,Thou the bitter reproach shalt hear....Forgive me, oh, forgive me then!\n",
      "Asleep! let me then, O hapless oneTo my bosom press thee once for all.A law unjust and terribleThee and me to sorrow dooms.While the years have not yet chasedThe guiltless joy of thy days,Sleep, my darling, let no griefs bitterMar thy childhood's quiet life!\n",
