*** Robert Louis Stevenson (1850 - 1894)


1. AUTUMN FIRES

	In the other gardens
	And all up the vale,
	From the autumn bonfires
	See the smoke trail!
	
	Pleasant summer over
	And all the summer flowers,
	The red fire blazes,
	The grey smoke towers.
	
	Sing a song of seasons!
	Something bright in all!
	Flowers in the summer,
	Fires in the fall!



2. BED IN SUMMER

	In winter I get up at night 
	And dress by yellow candle-light. 
	In summer, quite the other way, 
	I have to go to bed by day. 
	
	I have to go to bed and see 
	The birds still hopping on the tree, 
	Or hear the grown-up people’s feet 
	Still going past me in the street. 
	
	And does it not seem hard to you, 
	When all the sky is clear and blue, 
	And I should like so much to play, 
	To have to go to bed by day?



3. COME, HERE IS ADIEU TO THE CITY

	Come, here is adieu to the city
	And hurrah for the country again.
	The broad road lies before me
	Watered with last night’s rain.
	The timbered country woos me
	With many a high and bough;
	And again in the shining fallows
	The ploughman follows the plough.
	
	The whole year’s sweat and study,
	And the whole year’s sowing time,
	Comes now to the perfect harvest,
	And ripens now into rhyme.
	For we that sow in the Autumn,
	We reap our grain in the Spring,
	And we that go sowing and weeping
	Return to reap and sing.



4. REQUIEM

	Under the wide and starry sky,
	Dig the grave and let me lie.
	 Glad did I live and gladly die,
	And I laid me down with a will.
	
	This be the verse you grave for me:
	_Here he lies where he longed to be;
	Home is the sailor, home from sea,
	 And the hunter home from the hill._



5. SPRING SONG

	The air was full of sun and birds,
	The fresh air sparkled clearly.
	Remembrance wakened in my heart
	And I knew I loved her dearly.
	
	The fallows and the leafless trees
	And all my spirit tingled.
	My earliest thought of love, and Spring’s
	First puff of perfume mingled.
	
	In my still heart the thoughts awoke,
	Came lone by lone together--
	Say, birds and Sun and Spring, is Love
	A mere affair of weather?



6. WINTERTIME

	Late lies the wintry sun a-bed,   
	A frosty, fiery sleepy-head;   
	Blinks but an hour or two; and then,   
	A blood-red orange, sets again.   
	   
	Before the stars have left the skies, 
	At morning in the dark I rise;   
	And shivering in my nakedness,   
	By the cold candle, bathe and dress.   
	   
	Close by the jolly fire I sit   
	To warm my frozen bones a bit; 
	Or with a reindeer-sled, explore   
	The colder countries round the door.   
	   
	When to go out, my nurse doth wrap   
	Me in my comforter and cap;   
	The cold wind burns my face, and blows 
	Its frosty pepper up my nose.   
	   
	Black are my steps on silver sod;   
	Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;   
	And tree and house, and hill and lake,   
	Are frosted like a wedding-cake.
