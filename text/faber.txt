*** Frederick William Faber (1814 - 1863)


1. FIRST LOVE

	I have been long without a home, 
	And yearned too much for one; 
	And scanty are the deeds of faith 
	My lonely heart hath done: 
	For many a night my weary bed 
	Hath felt the weak tears run. 
	Cold armour of ambitious dreams 
	I bade my soul to wear, 
	And to false friendship’s wildfire sweet 
	Have laid my spirit bare; 
	And some few times pure heavenly thoughts 
	Awhile have lighted there. 
	
	But still my sickness grew, and still 
	The fever gained worse power; 
	And every star that gentlest shone 
	Above my dreary tower 
	Hath waned long since, or waneth now, 
	More palely every hour. 
	But I have felt thy light low voice, 
	Thy soft eye’s languid beam, 
	And light and colour have come back 
	Unto my purest dream, 
	And to my heart the old fresh blood 
	Hath mounted in a stream. 
	Health, power, deep gladness have come back 
	With shouts and songs of bliss; 
	Of all my loves in this bright crowd 
	There is not one I miss-- 
	Oh! never mortal soul hath had 
	A wakening like this! 
	
	No tossing now on feverish thoughts, 
	No sick heart’s burning swell, 
	No waiting day by day to bid 
	Each new false hope farewell, 
	Free, without chains, my spirit starts 
	And breaks the long dull spell. 
	It is not passion’s lurid light, 
	Nor friendship’s meteor way, 
	False gleams that through pale summer nights 
	From far-off tempests play, 
	But one rich golden orb that shines 
	Steady and large all day 
	A full, warm, fostering light wherein 
	The heart’s best foliage springs, 
	A flame to whose sweet sternness faith 
	Each brittle purpose brings, 
	An altar-fire where hope is fed, 
	And prayer and praise find wings. 
	
	Thou art too young for me to tell 
	My hidden love to thee; 
	And, till fit season, it must burn 
	In darkest privacy, 
	For years must pass and fortunes change 
	Till such fit season be. 
	Young as thou art, hadst thou but seen 
	This withered heart before, 
	And poured thy love, as o’er some plant 
	Thou dost fresh water pour, 
	And watched the fragrance and the hue 
	Grow into it once more-- 
	Thou wouldst, mayhap, have felt within 
	Thy first and sweetest strife, 
	And marvelled much at the new taste 
	And power it gave to life; 
	And so less like a dream had been 
	My first dream of a Wife.



2. JESUS, GENTLEST SAVIOR

	Jesus, gentlest Savior, 
	God of might and power, 
	thou thyself art dwelling 
	in us at this hour. 
	
	Nature cannot hold thee, 
	heaven is all too strait 
	for thine endless glory 
	and thy royal state. 
	
	Out beyond the shining 
	of the furthest star 
	thou art ever stretching 
	infinitely far. 
	
	Yet the hearts of children 
	hold what worlds cannot, 
	and the God of wonders 
	loves the lowly spot. 
	
	Jesus, gentlest Savior, 
	dwelling in us now, 
	fill us full of goodness 
	till our hearts o’erflow. 
	
	Multiply our graces, 
	chiefly love and fear, 
	and, dear Lord, the chiefest, 
	grace to persevere.



3. THE ROGATION DAYS

	_“Despise not thy mother when she is old.”_
	   --Prov. xxiii. 
	
	Heavy and sad the Church must go: 
	Full weary are her latter days, 
	And she must hush the voice of praise 
	While tears of penance flow. 
	And she must fast, though by her side 
	The Bridegroom yet on earth doth move; 
	And fear must be instead of love 
	For her own children’s pride. 
	
	Yet, holy Mother! Lent is past: 
	And long ago the Easter sun 
	Into the middle sky hath run;-- 
	Wherefore this second fast? 
	Mother! with us the Lord doth bide; 
	Yet but a little while He stays,-- 
	Then for three dim and lonely days 
	Why keep us from His side? 
	He said we should not fast when He 
	Came down to live with us below: 
	Then, holy Mother! why forego 
	Our ancient liberty? 
	When thou wert in thy virgin prime, 
	Those forty days through all the earth 
	Thy heart did swell with festal mirth-- 
	It was thy bridal time. 
	
	“Talk not, my son, of early days: 
	My precious stones were passing fair, 
	My life was Sacrament and prayer, 
	My unity was praise. 
	“These glories now are well-nigh past: 
	My son! the world is waxing strong; 
	The day is hot; the fight is long, 
	And therefore do I fast. 
	“And ye are weak, and cannot bear 
	Full forty days of Easter mirth: 
	And nought is left unstained of earth, 
	But penance, fast, and prayer. 
	“Oh! weary is my stay below; 
	And thus with strong and earnest cry, 
	As each Ascension-day glides by, 
	I fain with Him would go. 
	
	“Then watch and fast, like saints of yore; 
	These three new days perchance may bring 
	The earlier advent of our King, 
	And we shall fast no more!



4. THE WILL OF GOD

	I worship thee, sweet will of God! 
	And all thy ways adore; 
	And every day I live, I seem 
	To love thee more and more. 
	
	Thou wert the end, the blessed rule 
	Of our Saviour’s toils and tears; 
	Thou wert the passion of his heart 
	Those three and thirty years. 
	
	And he hath breathed into my soul 
	A special love of thee, 
	A love to lose my will in his, 
	And by that loss be free. 
	
	I love to see thee bring to naught 
	The plans of wily men; 
	When simple hearts outwit the wise, 
	Oh, thou art loveliest then. 
	
	The headstrong world it presses hard 
	Upon the church full oft, 
	And then how easily thou turn’st 
	The hard ways into soft. 
	
	I love to kiss each print where thou 
	Hast set thine unseen feet; 
	I cannot fear thee, blessed will! 
	Thine empire is so sweet. 
	
	When obstacles and trials seem 
	Like prison walls to be, 
	I do the little I can do, 
	And leave the rest to thee. 
	
	I know not what it is to doubt, 
	My heart is ever gay; 
	I run no risk, for, come what will, 
	Thou always hast thy way. 
	
	I have no cares, O blessed will! 
	For all my cares are thine: 
	I live in triumph, Lord! for thou 
	Hast made thy triumphs mine. 
	
	And when it seems no chance or change 
	From grief can set me free, 
	Hope finds its strength in helplessness, 
	And gayly waits on thee. 
	
	Man’s weakness, waiting upon God, 
	Its end can never miss, 
	For men on earth no work can do 
	More angel-like than this. 
	
	Ride on, ride on, triumphantly, 
	Thou glorious will, ride on! 
	Faith’s pilgrim sons behind thee take 
	The road that thou hast gone. 
	
	He always wins who sides with God, 
	To him no chance is lost; 
	God’s will is sweetest to him, when 
	It triumphs at his cost. 
	
	Ill that he blesses is our good, 
	And unblessed good is ill; 
	And all is right that seems most wrong. 
	If it be his sweet will.



5. THE WREN

	There is a bay, all still and lone, 
	And in the shade one broad grey stone 
	Where at the evening hour 
	The sun upon the water weaves 
	Motions of light among the leaves 
	Of a low-hanging bower: 
	And one old sycamore that dips 
	Into the stream its dark-green tips, 
	And drinks all day and night: 
	And opposite, the mountain high 
	Doth intercept the deep blue sky 
	And shuts it out from sight. 
	
	Last year it was my haunted seat, 
	And every evening did I meet 
	A grave and solemn Wren: 
	He sate and never spoke a word; 
	A holy and religious bird 
	He seemed unto me then. 
	I thought, perchance, that sin and strife 
	Might in a winged creature’s life 
	Be somehow strangely blent: 
	So hermit-like he lived apart, 
	And might be in his little heart 
	A woodland penitent! 
	Deceitful thing! into the brook, 
	Hour after hour, a stedfast look 
	From off his perch was sent; 
	And yet I thought his eyes too bright, 
	Too happy for an anchorite 
	On lonely penance bent. 
	
	Ah! yes--for long his nest hath been 
	Behind yon alder’s leafy screen 
	By Rothay’s chiming waters: 
	Two rapid years are run, and now 
	This monk hath peopled every bough 
	With little sons and daughters. 
	I will not blame thee, Friar Wren, 
	Because among stout-hearted men 
	Some truant monks there be; 
	And, if you could their names collect, 
	I rather more than half suspect 
	That I should not be free. 
	Erewhile I dreamed of cloistered cells, 
	Of gloomy courts and matin bells, 
	And painted windows rare; 
	But common life’s less real gleams 
	Shone warm on my monastic dreams, 
	And melted them to air. 
	
	My captive heart is altered now; 
	And, had I but one little bough 
	Of thy green alder-tree, 
	I would not live too long alone, 
	Or languish there for want of one 
	To share the nest with me!
