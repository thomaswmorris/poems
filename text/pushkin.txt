*** Alexander Pushkin (1799 - 1837)


1. THE ANGEL

	At the gates of Eden a tender angel
	With drooping head was shining;
	A demon gloomy and rebellious
	Over hell’s abyss was flying.
	
	The Spirit of Denial the Spirit of Doubt
	The Spirit of Purity espied;
	And a tender warmth unwittingly
	Now first to know it learned he.
	
	Adieu he spake thee I saw:
	Not in vain hast thou shone before me;
	Not all in the world have I hated
	Not all in the world have I scorned.


2. THE AWAKING

	Ye dreams ye dreams
	Where is your sweetness?
	Where thou where thou
	O joy of night?
	Disappeared has it
	The joyous dream;
	And solitary
	In darkness deep
	I awaken.
	Round my bed
	Is silent night.
	At once are cooled
	At once are fled
	All in a crowd
	The dreams of Love--
	Still with longing
	The soul is filled
	And grasps of sleep
	The memory.
	O Love O Love
	O hear my prayer:
	Again send me
	Those visions thine
	And on the morrow
	Raptured anew
	Let me die
	Without awaking!


3. THE BARD

	Have ye heard in the woods the nightly voice
	Of the bard of love of the bard of his grief?
	When the fields in the morning hour were still
	The flute’s sad sound and simple
	             Have ye heard?
	
	Have ye met in the desert darkness of the forest
	The bard of love the bard of his grief?
	Was it a track of tears was it a smile
	Or a quiet glance filled with melancholy
	             Have ye met?
	
	Have ye sighed listening to the calm voice
	Of the bard of love of the bard of grief?
	When in the woods the youth ye saw
	And met the glance of his dulled eyes
	             Have ye sighed?


4. THE BIRDLET

	God’s birdlet knows
	Nor care nor toil;
	Nor weaves it painfully
	An everlasting nest.
	Thro’ the long night on the twig it slumbers;
	When rises the red sun
	Birdie listens to the voice of God
	And it starts and it sings.
	When Spring Nature’s Beauty
	And the burning summer have passed
	And the fog and the rain
	By the late fall are brought
	Men are wearied men are grieved
	But birdie flies into distant lands
	Into warm climes beyond the blue sea:
	Flies away until the spring.


5. THE BLACK SHAWL

	I gaze demented on the black shawl
	And my cold soul is torn by grief.
	
	When young I was and full of trust
	I passionately loved a young Greek girl.
	
	The charming maid she fondled me
	But soon I lived the black day to see.
	
	Once as were gathered my jolly guests
	A detested Jew knocked at my door.
	
	Thou art feasting (he whispered) with friends
	But betrayed thou art by thy Greek maid.
	
	Moneys I gave him and curses
	And called my servant the faithful.
	
	We went: I flew on the wings of my steed;
	And tender mercy was silent in me.
	
	Her threshold no sooner I espied
	Dark grew my eyes and my strength departed.
	
	The distant chamber I enter alone
	An Armenian embraces my faithless maid.
	
	Darkness around me; flashed the dagger;
	To interrupt his kiss the wretch had no time.
	
	And long I trampled the headless corpse--
	And silent and pale at the maid I stared.
	
	I remember her prayers her flowing blood
	But perished the girl and with her my love.
	
	The shawl I took from the head now dead
	And wiped in silence the bleeding steel.
	
	When came the darkness of eve my serf
	Threw their bodies into the Danube’s billows--
	
	Since then I kiss no charming eyes
	Since then I know no cheerful days.
	
	I gaze demented on the black shawl
	And my cold soul is torn by grief.


6. THE BURNT LETTER

	Good-bye love-letter good-bye! ‘T is her command . . .
	How long I waited how long my hand
	To the fire my joys to yield was loath! . . .
	But eno’ the hour has come: burn letter of my love!
	I am ready: listens more my soul to nought.
	Now the greedy flame thy sheets shall lick . . .
	A minute! . . . they crackle they blaze . . . a light smoke
	Curls and is lost with prayer mine.
	Now the finger’s faithful imprint losing
	Burns the melted wax . . . O Heavens!
	Done it is! curled in are the dark sheets;
	Upon their ashes light the lines adored
	Are gleaming . . . My breast is heavy. Ashes dear
	In my sorrowful lot but poor consolation
	Remain for aye with me on my weary breast . . .


7. THE CLOUD

	O last cloud of the scattered storm
	Alone thou sailest along the azure clear;
	Alone thou bringest the shadow sombre
	Alone thou marrest the joyful day.
	
	Thou but recently had’st encircled the sky
	When sternly the lightning was winding about thee;
	Thou gavest forth mysterious thunder
	With rain hast watered the parched earth.
	
	Enough! Hie thyself: thy time hath passed:
	Earth is refreshed; the storm hath fled;
	And the breeze fondling the trees’ leaves
	Forth thee chases from the quieted heavens!


8. THE COSSAK

	Once at midnight hour
	Darkness thro’ and fog
	Quiet by the river
	Rode a Cossak brave.
	
	Black his cap upon his ear
	Dust-covered is his coat
	By his knee the pistols hang
	And nigh the ground his sword.
	
	The faithful steed rein not feeling
	Is walking slowly on
	(Long its mane is and is waving)
	Ever further it keeps on.
	
	Now before him two--three huts:
	Broken is the fence;
	To the village here the road
	To the forest there.
	
	“Not in forest maid is found”
	Dennis thinks the brave.
	“To their chambers went the maids;
	Are gone for the night.”
	
	The son of Don he pulls the rein
	And the spur he strikes:
	Like an arrow rushed the steed--
	To the huts he turned.
	
	In the clouds the distant sky
	Was silvering the moon;
	A Beauty-Maid in melancholy
	By the window sits.
	
	Espies the brave the Beauty-Maid
	Beats his heart within:
	Gently steed to left to left--
	Under the window now is he.
	
	“Darker growing is the night
	And hidden is the moon;
	Quick my darling do come out
	Water give my steed.”
	
	“No not unto a man so young;
	Right fearful’t is to go;
	Fearful’t is my house to leave
	And water give thy steed.”
	
	“Have no fear O Beauty-Maid
	And friendship close with me“--
	“Brings danger night to Beauty-Maids”
	“Fear me not O joy of mine!
	
	“Trust me dear thy fear is vain
	Away with terror groundless!
	Time thou losest precious
	Fear not O my darling!
	
	Mount my steed; with thee I will
	To distant regions gallop;
	Blest with me be thou shalt
	Heaven with mate is everywhere.”
	
	And the maid? Over she bends
	Her fear is overcome
	Bashfully to ride consents
	And the Cossak happy is.
	
	Off they dart away they fly;
	Are loving one another.
	Faithful he for two brief weeks
	Forsook her on the third.


9. DEATH-THOUGHTS

	Whether I roam along the noisy streets
	Whether I enter the peopled temple
	Whether I sit by thoughtless youth
	Haunt my thoughts me everywhere.
	
	I say Swiftly go the years by:
	However great our number now
	Must all descend the eternal vaults--
	Already struck has some one’s hour.
	
	And if I gaze upon the lonely oak
	I think: the patriarch of the woods
	Will survive my passing age
	As he survived my father’s age.
	
	And if a tender babe I fondle
	Already I mutter Fare thee well!
	I yield my place to thee. For me
	‘T is time to decay to bloom for thee
	
	Every year thus every day
	With death my thought I join
	Of coming death the day
	I seek among them to divine.
	
	Where will Fortune send me death?
	In battle? In wanderings or on the waves
	Or shall the valley neighboring
	Receive my chilled dust?
	
	But tho’ the unfeeling body
	Can everywhere alike decay
	Still I my birthland nigh
	Would have my body lie.
	
	Let near the entrance to my grave
	Cheerful youth be in play engaged
	And let indifferent creation
	With beauty shine there eternally.


10. DESPAIR

	Dear my friend we are now parted
	My soul’s asleep; I grieve in silence.
	Gleams the day behind the mountain blue
	Or rises the night with moon autumnal--
	Still thee I seek my far off friend
	Thee alone remember I everywhere
	Thee alone in restless sleep I see.
	Pauses my mind unwittingly thee I call;
	Listens mine ear then thy voice I hear.
	
	And thou my lyre my despair dost share
	Of sick my soul companion thou!
	Hollow is and sad the sound of thy string
	Grief’s sound alone hast not forgot . . .
	Faithful lyre with me grieve thou!
	Let thine easy note and careless
	Sing of love mine and despair
	And while listening to thy singing
	May thoughtfully the maidens sigh!


11. THE DROWNED

	Into the hut the children run
	In haste they called their father:
	“Papa papa oh our nets
	Out a corpse have dragged.”
	“Ye lie ye lie ye little devils”
	Upon them father grumbled.
	“I declare those wicked brats!
	Corpse now too have they must!
	
	“Down will come the court ‘Give answer!’
	And for an age no rest from it.
	But what to do? Heigh wife there
	My coat give me must get there somehow . . .
	Now where’s the corpse?“--“Here papa here!”
	And in truth along the river
	Where is spread the moistened net
	Upon the sand is seen the corpse.
	
	Disfigured terribly the corpse is
	Is blue and all is swollen.
	Is it a hapless sorrower
	Who ruined has his sinful soul
	Or by the waves a fisher taken
	Or some fellow drunkard
	Or by robbers stripped perchance
	Trader some unbusinesslike?
	
	To the peasant what is this?
	About he looks and hastens . . .
	Seizes he the body drowned
	By the feet to water drags it
	And from the shore the winding
	Off he pushes it with oar
	Downward ‘gain floats the corpse
	And grave and cross still is seeking.
	
	And long the dead among the waves
	As if living swinging floated;
	With his eyes the peasant him
	Homeward going followed.
	“Ye little dogs now follow me
	Each of you a cake shall have;
	But look ye out and hold your tongues!
	Else a thrashing shall ye have.”
	
	At night the wind to blow began
	Full of waves became the river;
	Out the light was already going
	In the peasant’s smoky hut.
	The children sleep; the mother slumbers.
	On the oven husband lies.
	Howls the storm; a sudden knocking
	He hears of some one at the window.
	
	“Who’s there?“--“Ope the door I say!”
	“Time eno’; what is the matter?
	Wherefore comes tramp at night?
	By the devil art hither brought!
	Wherefore with you should I bother?
	Crowded my house and dark is.”
	So saying he with lazy hand
	Open throws the window.
	
	Rolls the moon from behind the clouds--
	And now? A naked man before him stands;
	From his beard a stream is flowing
	His glance is fixed and is open.
	All about him is frightful dumbness
	And his hands are dropped down;
	And to the puffed-out swollen body
	Black crabs are fastened.
	
	The peasant quickly shuts the window;
	He recognized his naked guest
	Is terror-struck. “May you burst!”
	Out he whispered and trembled.
	In great confusion now his thoughts are
	And all night he shakes in fever;
	And till the morrow still the knocking
	‘S heard on the window and at the gates.
	
	Report there was among the people:
	Saying since then every year
	Waiting is the hapless peasant
	For his guest on the appointed day.
	In the morning the weather changes
	And at night the storm arrives
	And the dead man is ever knocking
	By the window and at the gates.


12. ELEGY

	Happy who to himself confess
	His passion dares without terror;
	Happy who in fate uncertain
	By modest hope is fondled;
	Happy who by foggy moonbeams
	Is led to midnight joyful
	And with faithful key who gently
	The door unlocks of his beloved.
	
	But for me in sad my life
	No joy there is of secret pleasure;
	Hope’s early flower faded is
	By struggle withered is life’s flower.
	Youth away flies melancholy
	And droop with me life’s roses;
	But by Love tho’ long forgot
	Forget Love’s tears I cannot.


13. THE GYPSIES

	Over the wooded banks
	In the hour of evening quiet
	Under the tents are song and bustle
	And the fires are scattered.
	
	Thee I greet O happy race!
	I recognize thy blazes
	I myself at other times
	These tents would have followed.
	
	With the early rays to-morrow
	Shall disappear your freedom’s trace
	Go you will--but not with you
	Longer go shall the bard of you.
	
	He alas the changing lodgings
	And the pranks of days of yore
	Has forgot for rural comforts
	And for the quiet of a home.


14. HOME-SICKNESS

	Mayhap not long am destined I
	In exile peaceful to remain
	Of dear days of yore to sigh
	And rustic muse in quiet
	With spirit calm to follow.
	
	But even far in foreign land
	In thought forever roam I shall
	Around Trimountain mine:
	By meadows river by its hills
	By garden linden nigh the house.
	
	Thus when darkens day the clear
	Alone from depths of grave
	Spirit home-longing
	Into the native hall flies
	To espy the loved ones with tender glance.


15. IN AN ALBUM

	The name of me what is it to thee
	Die it shall like the grievous sound
	Of wave playing on distant shore
	As sound of night in forest dark.
	
	Upon the sheet of memory
	Its traces dead leave it shall
	Inscriptions-like of grave-yard
	In some foreign tongue.
	
	What is in it? Long ago forgotten
	In tumultuous waves and fresh
	To thy soul not give it shall
	Pure memories and tender.
	
	But on sad days in calmness
	Do pronounce it sadly;
	Say then: I do remember thee--
	On earth one heart is where yet I live!


16. INSANITY

	God grant I grow not insane:
	No better the stick and beggar’s bag:
	No better toil and hunger bear.
	
	Not that I upon my reason
	Such value place; not that I
	Would fain not lose it.
	
	If freedom to me they would leave
	How I would lasciviously
	   For the gloomy forest rush!
	
	In hot delirium I would sing
	And unconscious would remain
	With ravings wondrous and chaotic.
	
	And listen would I to the waves
	And gaze I would full of bliss
	   Into the empty heavens.
	
	And free and strong then would I be
	Like a storm the fields updigging
	   Forest-trees uprooting.
	
	But here’s the trouble: if crazy once
	A fright thou art like pestilence
	   And locked up now shalt thou be.
	
	To a chain thee fool they ‘ll fasten
	And through the gate a circus beast
	Thee to nettle the people come.
	
	And at night not hear shall I
	Clear the voice of nightingale
	   Nor the forest’s hollow sound
	
	But cries alone of companions mine
	And the scolding guards of night
	   And a whizzing of chains a ringing.


17. INSPIRING LOVE

	The moment wondrous I remember
	Thou before me didst appear
	Like a flashing apparition
	Like a spirit of beauty pure.
	
	‘Mid sorrows of hopeless grief
	‘Mid tumults of noiseful bustle
	Rang long to me thy tender voice
	Came dreams to me of thy lovely features.
	
	Went by the years. The storm’s rebellious rush
	The former dreams had scattered
	And I forgot thy tender voice
	I forgot thy heavenly features.
	
	In the desert in prison’s darkness
	Quietly my days were dragging;
	No reverence nor inspiration
	Nor tears nor life nor love.
	
	But at last awakes my soul:
	And again didst thou appear:
	Like a flashing apparition
	Like a spirit of beauty pure.
	
	And enraptured beats my heart
	And risen are for it again
	Both reverence and inspiration
	And life and tears and love.


18. INVOCATION

	Oh if true it is that by night
	When resting are the living
	And from the sky the rays of moon
	Along the stones of church-yard glide;
	O if true it is that emptied then
	Are the quiet graves
	I call thy shade I wait my Lila
	Come hither come hither my friend to me!
	
	Appear O shade of my beloved
	As thou before our parting wert:
	Pale cold like a wintry day
	Disfigured by thy struggle of death
	Come like unto a distant star
	Or like a fearful apparition
	‘T is all the same: Come hither come hither
	
	And I call thee not in order
	To reproach him whose wickedness
	My friend hath slain.
	Nor to fathom the grave’s mysteries
	Nor because at times I’m worn
	With gnawing doubt . . . but I sadly
	Wish to say that still I love thee
	That wholly thine I am: hither come O hither!


19. LOVE’S DEBT

	For the shores of thy distant home
	Thou hast forsaken the foreign land;
	In a memorable sad hour
	I before thee cried long.
	Tho’ cold my hands were growing
	Thee back to hold they tried;
	And begged of thee my parting groan
	The gnawing weariness not to break.
	
	But from my bitter kisses thou
	Thy lips away hast torn;
	From the land of exile dreary
	Calling me to another land.
	Thou saidst: on the day of meeting
	Beneath a sky forever blue
	Olives’ shade beneath love’s kisses
	Again my friend we shall unite.
	
	But where alas! the vaults of sky
	Shining are with glimmer blue
	Where ‘neath the rocks the waters slumber--
	With last sleep art sleeping thou.
	And beauty thine and sufferings
	In the urnal grave have disappeared--
	But the kiss of meeting is also gone . . .
	But still I wait: thou art my debtor! . . .


20. MY DEMON

	In those days when new to me were
	Of existence all impressions:--
	The maiden’s glances the forests’ whisper
	The song of nightingale at night;
	When the sentiments elevated
	Of Freedom glory and of love
	And of art the inspiration
	Stirred deeply so my blood:--
	My hopeful hours and joyful
	With melancholy sudden dark’ning
	A certain evil spirit then
	Began in secret me to visit.
	Grievous were our meetings
	His smile and his wonderful glance
	His speeches these so stinging
	Cold poison poured into my soul.
	Providence with slander
	Inexhaustible he tempted;
	Of Beauty as a dream he spake
	And inspiration he despised;
	Nor love nor freedom trusted he
	On life with scorn he looked--
	And nought in all nature
	To bless he ever wished.


21. MY MUSE

	In the days of my youth she was fond of me
	And the seven-stemmed flute she handed me.
	To me with smile she listened; and already gently
	Along the openings echoing of the woods
	Was playing I with fingers tender:
	Both hymns solemn god-inspired
	And peaceful song of Phrygian shepherd.
	From morn till night in oak’s dumb shadow
	To the strange maid’s teaching intent I listened;
	And with sparing reward me gladdening
	Tossing back her curls from her forehead dear
	From my hands the flute herself she took.
	Now filled the wood was with breath divine
	And the heart with holy enchantment filled.


22. THE NIGHTINGALE

	In silent gardens in the spring in the darkness of the night
	Sings above the rose from the east the nightingale;
	But dear rose neither feeling has nor listens it
	But under its lover’s hymn waveth it and slumbers.
	
	Dost thou not sing thus to beauty cold?
	Reflect O bard whither art thou striding?
	She neither listens nor the bard she feels.
	Thou gazest? Bloom she does; thou callest?--
	     Answer none she gives!


23. THE NORTH WIND

	Why O wrathful north wind thou
	The marshy shrub dost downward bend?
	Why thus in the distant sky-vault
	Wrathfully the cloud dost chase?
	
	The black clouds but recently
	Had spread the whole heavens o’er
	The oak on hill top but recently
	In beauty wondrous itself was priding.
	
	Thou hast risen and up hast played
	With terror resounded and with splendor--
	And away are driven the stormy clouds;
	Down is hurled the mighty oak.
	
	Let now then the sun’s clear face
	With joy henceforth ever shine
	With the clouds now the zephyr play
	And the bush in quiet sway.


24. THE OUTCAST

	On a rainy autumn evening
	Into desert places went a maid;
	And the secret fruit of unhappy love
	In her trembling hands she held.
	All was still: the hills and the woods
	Asleep in the darkness of the night.
	And her searching glances
	In terror about she cast.
	
	And on this babe the innocent
	Her glance she paused with a sigh:
	Asleep thou art my child my grief.
	Thou knowest not my sadness.
	Thine eyes will ope and tho’ with longing
	To my breast shalt no more cling.
	No kiss for thee to-morrow
	From thine unhappy mother.
	
	Beckon in vain for her thou wilt
	My everlasting shame my guilt!
	Me forget thou shalt for aye
	But thee forget shall not I.
	Shelter thou shalt receive from strangers
	Who ‘ll say: Thou art none of ours!
	Thou wilt ask Where are my parents?
	But for thee no kin is found!
	
	Hapless one! With heart filled with sorrow
	Lonely amid thy mates
	Thy spirit sullen to the end
	Thou shalt behold fondling mothers.
	A lonely wanderer everywhere
	Cursing thy fate at all times
	Thou the bitter reproach shalt hear....
	Forgive me oh forgive me then!
	
	Asleep! let me then O hapless one
	To my bosom press thee once for all.
	A law unjust and terrible
	Thee and me to sorrow dooms.
	While the years have not yet chased
	The guiltless joy of thy days
	Sleep my darling let no griefs bitter
	Mar thy childhood’s quiet life!
	
	But lo! behind the woods near by
	The moon brings a hut to light.
	Forlorn pale and trembling
	To the doors nigh she came.
	She stooped and gently laid she down
	The babe on the threshold strange.
	In terror away her eyes she turned
	And in the dark night disappeared.


25. A PRESENTIMENT

	The clouds again are o’er me
	Have gathered in the stillness;
	Again me with misfortune
	Envious fate now threatens.
	Will I keep my defiance?
	Will I bring against her
	The firmness and patience
	Of my youthful pride?
	
	Wearied by a stormy life
	I await the storm fretless
	Perhaps once more safe again
	A harbor shall I find . . .
	But I feel the parting nigh
	Unavoidable fearful hour
	To press thy hand for the last time
	I haste to thee my angel.
	
	Angel gentle angel calm
	Gently tell me: fare thee well.
	Be thou grieved: thy tender gaze
	Either drop or to me raise.
	The memory of thee now shall
	To my soul replace
	The strength the pride and the hope
	The daring of my former days!


26. THE PROPHET

	Tormented by the thirst for the spirit
	I was dragging myself in a sombre desert
	And a six-winged seraph appeared
	Unto me on the parting of the roads.
	With fingers as light as a dream
	Mine eyes he touched:
	And mine eyes opened wise
	Like the eyes of a frightened eagle;
	He touched mine ears
	And they filled with din and ringing.
	And I heard the trembling of the heavens
	And the flight of the angel’s wings
	And the creeping of the polyps in the sea
	And the growth of the vine in the valley.
	And he took hold of my lips
	And out he tore my sinful tongue
	With its empty and false speech.
	And the fang of the wise serpent
	Between my terrified lips he placed
	With bloody hand.
	And ope he cut with sword my breast
	And out he took my trembling heart
	And a coal with flaming blaze
	Into the opened breast he shoved.
	Like a corpse I lay in the desert.
	And the voice of God unto me called:
	Arise O prophet and listen and guide.
	Be thou filled with my will
	And going over land and sea
	Fire with the word the hearts of men!


27. REGRET

	Not ye regret I of spring my years
	In dreams gone by of hopeless love;
	Not ye regret I O mysteries of nights.
	By songstress passionate celebrated;
	
	Not ye regret I O my faithless friends
	Nor crowns of feasts nor cups of circle
	Nor ye regret I O traitresses young--
	To pleasures melancholy stranger am I.
	
	But where are ye O moments tender
	Of young my hopes of heartfelt peace?
	The former heat and grace of inspiration?
	Come again O ye of spring my years!


28. REMINISCENCE

	When noisy day to mortals quiet grows
	And upon the city’s silent walls
	Night’s shadow half-transparent lies
	And Sleep of daily toils reward--
	Then for me are dragging in the silence
	Of wearying wakefulness the hours.
	In the sloth of night more scorching burn
	My heart’s serpents’ gnawing fangs;
	Boil my thoughts; my soul with grief oppressed
	Full of reveries sad is thronged.
	Before me memory in silence
	Its lengthy roll unfolds.
	And with disgust my life I reading
	Tremble I and curse it.
	Bitterly I moan and bitterly my tears I shed
	But wash away the lines of grief I cannot.
	
	In laziness in senseless feasts
	In the craziness of ruinous license
	In thraldom poverty and homeless deserts
	My wasted years there I behold.
	Of friends again I hear the treacherous greeting
	Games amid of love and wine.
	To the heart again insults brings
	Irrepressible the cold world.
	No joy for me--and calmly before me
	Of visions young two now rise:
	Two tender shades two angels me
	Given by fate in the days of yore.
	But both have wings and flaming swords
	And they watch-- . . . and both are vengeant
	And both to me speak with death tongue
	Of Eternity’s mysteries and of the grave.


29. RESURRECTION

	With sleepy brush the barbarian artist
	The master’s painting blackens;
	And thoughtlessly his wicked drawing
	Over it he is daubing.
	
	But in years the foreign colors
	Peal off an aged layer:
	The work of genius is ‘gain before us
	With former beauty out it comes.
	
	Thus my failings vanish too
	From my wearied soul
	And again within it visions rise
	Of my early purer days.


30. THE ROUSSALKA

	By a lake once in forest darkness
	A monk his soul was saving
	Ever in stern occupation
	Of prayer fast and labor.
	Already with slackened shovel
	The aged man his grave was digging
	And only for death in peace and quiet
	To his saintly patrons prayed he.
	
	Once in summer at the threshold
	Of his drooping little hut
	To God was praying the hermit.
	Darker grew the forest.
	Over the lake was rising fog.
	And in the clouds the reddish moon
	Was gently rolling along the sky.
	Upon the waters the hermit gazed.
	
	He looks and fears and knows not why
	Himself he cannot understand . . .
	Now he sees: the waves are seething
	And suddenly again are quiet . . .
	
	Suddenly . . . as light as shade of night
	As white as early snow of hills
	Out cometh a woman naked
	And on the shore herself she seats.
	
	Upon the aged monk she gazes
	And she combs her moistened tresses--
	The holy monk with terror trembles
	Upon her charms still he gazes;
	With her hand to him she beckons
	And her head she’s quickly nodding....
	And suddenly like a falling star
	The dreamy wave she vanished under.
	
	The sober monk all night he slept not
	And all day he prayed not
	The shadow unwittingly before him
	Of the wondrous maid he ever sees.
	Again the forest is clad in darkness
	Along the clouds the moon is sailing.
	Again the maid above the water
	Pale and splendent there she sits.
	
	Gaze her eyes nods her head
	Throws kisses and she’s sporting
	The wave she sprinkles and she frolics;
	Child-like weeping now and laughing;
	
	Sobbing tender--the monk she calls:
	Monk O monk to me to me!
	Into the waves transparent she dashes;
	And again is all in silence deep.
	
	But on the third day the roused hermit
	The enchanted shores nigh sitting was
	And the beautiful maid he awaited.
	Upon the trees were falling shades....
	Night at last by dawn was chased--
	And nowhere monk could be found
	His beard alone the gray one
	In the water the boys could see.


31. SPANISH LOVE-SONG

	       Evening Zephyr
	       Waves the ether.
	       Murmurs
	       Rushes
	       The Guadalquivir.
	
	Now the golden moon has risen
	Quiet... Tshoo ... guitar’s now heard....
	Now the Spanish girl young
	O’er the balcony has leaned.
	
	       Evening Zephyr
	       Waves the ether.
	       Murmurs
	       Rushes
	       The Guadalquivir.
	
	Drop thy mantle angel gentle
	And appear as fair as day!
	Thro’ the iron balustrade
	Put thy wondrous tender foot!
	
	       Evening Zephyr
	       Waves the ether.
	       Murmurs
	       Rushes
	       The Guadalquivir.


32. WINTER EVENING

	The storm the sky with darkness covers
	The snowy whirlings twisting;
	Like a beast wild now is howling
	Like an infant now is crying;
	Over the aged roof now sudden
	In the straw it rustling is;
	Like a traveller now belated
	For entrance at our window knocking.
	
	With melancholy and with darkness
	Our little aged hut is filled
	Why in silence then thou sittest
	By the window wife old mine?
	Or by the howling storms art
	Wearied thou O companion mine?
	Or perchance art slumbering
	By the rustling spindle soothed?
	
	Let us drink O kindly friend
	Of my poverty and youth
	Away with grief--where is the cup?
	Joy it shall bring to our heart.
	
	A song now sing me how the bird
	Beyond the sea in quiet lived;
	A song now sing me how the maiden
	In the morning for water went.
	
	The storm the sky with darkness covers
	The snowy whirlings twisting;
	Like a beast wild now is howling
	Like an infant now is crying.
	Let us drink O kindly friend
	Of my poverty and youth
	Away with grief--where is the cup
	Joy it shall bring to our heart!


33. WINTER MORNING

	Frost and sun--the day is wondrous!
	Thou still art slumbering charming friend.
	‘Tis time O Beauty to awaken:
	Ope thine eyes now in sweetness closed
	To meet the Northern Dawn of Morning
	Thyself a north-star do thou appear!
	
	Last night remember the storm scolded
	And darkness floated in the clouded sky;
	Like a yellow clouded spot
	Thro’ the clouds the moon was gleaming--
	And melancholy thou wert sitting--
	But now . . . thro’ the window cast a look:
	
	Stretched beneath the heavens blue
	Carpet-like magnificent
	In the sun the snow is sparkling;
	Dark alone is the wood transparent
	And thro’ the hoar gleams green the fir
	And under the ice the rivulet sparkles.
	
	Entire is lighted with diamond splendor
	Thy chamber . . . with merry crackle
	The wood is crackling in the oven.
	To meditation invites the sofa.
	But know you? In the sleigh not order why
	The brownish mare to harness?
	
	Over the morning snow we gliding
	Trust we shall my friend ourselves
	To the speed of impatient steed;
	Visit we shall the fields forsaken
	The woods dense but recently
	And the banks so dear to me.


34. THE WINTER-ROAD

	Breaking thro’ the waving fogs
	Forth the moon is coming
	And on the gloomy acres
	She gloomy light is shedding.
	
	Along the wintry cheerless road
	Flies the rapid troika
	The little bell monotonous
	Wearily is tinkling.
	
	A certain homefulness is heard
	In the driver’s lengthy lays:
	Now light-hearted carelessness
	Now low-spirited sadness.
	
	Neither light nor a dark hut . . .
	Only snow and silence . . .
	Striped mileposts are alone
	The travellers who meet us.
	
	Sad I feel and weary . . . On the morrow Nina
	To my beloved I returning
	Forget myself shall by the fire
	And scarce eno’ at her shall gaze.
	
	Loudly of my watch the spring
	Its measured circle is completing
	And us the parter of the wearied
	Midnight not shall separate.
	
	Sad I’m Nina; my journey’s weary;
	Slumbering now my driver is quiet
	The little bell is monotonous
	And darkened now is the moon’s face.
