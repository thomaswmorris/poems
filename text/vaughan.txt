*** Henry Vaughan (1621 - 1695)


1. CHRIST’S NATIVITY

	Awake, glad heart! get up and sing!
	It is the birth-day of thy King.
	Awake! awake!
	The Sun doth shake
	Light from his locks, and all the way
	Breathing perfumes, doth spice the day.
	Awake, awake! hark how th’ wood rings;
	Winds whisper, and the busy springs
	A concert make;
	Awake! awake!
	Man is their high-priest, and should rise
	To offer up the sacrifice.
	I would I were some bird, or star,
	Flutt’ring in woods, or lifted far
	Above this inn
	And road of sin!
	Then either star or bird should be
	Shining or singing still to thee.
	I would I had in my best part
	Fit rooms for thee! or that my heart
	Were so clean as
	Thy manger was!
	But I am all filth, and obscene;
	Yet, if thou wilt, thou canst make clean.
	Sweet Jesu! will then. Let no more
	This leper haunt and soil thy door!
	Cure him, ease him,
	O release him!
	And let once more, by mystic birth,
	The Lord of life be born in earth.


2. ETERNITY

	I saw Eternity the other night,
	Like a great ring of pure and endless light,
	All calm, as it was bright;
	And round beneath it, Time in hours, days, years,
	Driv’n by the spheres
	Like a vast shadow mov’d; in which the world
	And all her train were hurl’d.
	The doting lover in his quaintest strain
	Did there complain;
	Near him, his lute, his fancy, and his flights,
	Wit’s sour delights,
	With gloves, and knots, the silly snares of pleasure,
	Yet his dear treasure
	All scatter’d lay, while he his eyes did pour
	Upon a flow’r.
	The darksome statesman hung with weights and woe,
	Like a thick midnight-fog mov’d there so slow,
	He did not stay, nor go;
	Condemning thoughts (like sad eclipses) scowl
	Upon his soul,
	And clouds of crying witnesses without
	Pursued him with one shout.
	Yet digg’d the mole, and lest his ways be found,
	Work’d under ground,
	Where he did clutch his prey; but one did see
	That policy;
	Churches and altars fed him; perjuries
	Were gnats and flies;
	It rain’d about him blood and tears, but he
	Drank them as free.
	The fearful miser on a heap of rust
	Sate pining all his life there, did scarce trust
	His own hands with the dust,
	Yet would not place one piece above, but lives
	In fear of thieves;
	Thousands there were as frantic as himself,
	And hugg’d each one his pelf;
	The downright epicure plac’d heav’n in sense,
	And scorn’d pretence,
	While others, slipp’d into a wide excess,
	Said little less;
	The weaker sort slight, trivial wares enslave,
	Who think them brave;
	And poor despised Truth sate counting by
	Their victory.
	Yet some, who all this while did weep and sing,
	And sing, and weep, soar’d up into the ring;
	But most would use no wing.
	O fools (said I) thus to prefer dark night
	Before true light,
	To live in grots and caves, and hate the day
	Because it shews the way,
	The way, which from this dead and dark abode
	Leads up to God,
	A way where you might tread the sun, and be
	More bright than he.
	But as I did their madness so discuss
	One whisper’d thus,
	“This ring the Bridegroom did for none provide,
	But for his bride.”


3. THE EVENING WATCH

	_Body_:
	
	Farewell! I go to sleep; but when
	The day-star springs, I’ll wake again.
	
	
	_Soul_:
	
	Go, sleep in peace; and when thou liest
	Unnumber’d in thy dust, when all this frame
	Is but one dram, and what thou now descriest
	In sev’ral parts shall want a name,
	Then may his peace be with thee, and each dust
	Writ in his book, who ne’er betray’d man’s trust!
	
	
	_Body_:
	
	Amen! but hark, ere we two stray
	How many hours dost think ‘till day?
	
	
	_Soul_:
	
	Ah go; th’art weak, and sleepy. Heav’n
	Is a plain watch, and without figures winds
	All ages up; who drew this circle, even
	He fills it; days and hours are blinds.
	Yet this take with thee. The last gasp of time
	Is thy first breath, and man’s eternal prime.


4. MOUNT OF OLIVES

	Sweet, sacred hill! on whose fair brow
	My Saviour sate, shall I allow
	Language to love,
	And idolize some shade, or grove,
	Neglecting thee? such ill-plac’d wit,
	Conceit, or call it what you please,
	Is the brain’s fit,
	And mere disease.
	
	Cotswold and Cooper’s both have met
	With learnèd swains, and echo yet
	Their pipes and wit;
	But thou sleep’st in a deep neglect,
	Untouch’d by any; and what need
	The sheep bleat thee a silly lay,
	That heard’st both reed
	And sheepward play?
	
	Yet if poets mind thee well,
	They shall find thou art their hill,
	And fountain too.
	Their Lord with thee had most to do;
	He wept once, walk’d whole nights on thee:
	And from thence—His suff’rings ended—
	Unto glory
	Was attended.
	
	Being there, this spacious ball
	Is but His narrow footstool all;
	And what we think
	Unsearchable, now with one wink 
	He doth comprise; but in this air
	When He did stay to bear our ill
	And sin, this hill
	Was then His Chair.


5. THE RELAPSE

	My God, how gracious art thou! I had slipt
	Almost to hell,
	And on the verge of that dark, dreadful pit
	Did hear them yell,
	But O thy love! thy rich, almighty love
	That sav’d my soul,
	And checkt their fury, when I saw them move,
	And heard them howl;
	O my sole comfort, take no more these ways,
	This hideous path,
	And I will mend my own without delays,
	Cease thou thy wrath!
	I have deserv’d a thick, Egyptian damp,
	Dark as my deeds,
	Should mist within me, and put out that lamp
	Thy spirit feeds;
	A darting conscience full of stabs and fears;
	No shade but Yew,
	Sullen, and sad eclipses, cloudy spheres,
	These are my due.
	But he that with his blood, (a price too dear,)
	My scores did pay,
	Bid me, by virtue from him, challenge here
	The brightest day;
	Sweet, downy thoughts; soft lily-shades; calm streams;
	Joys full and true;
	Fresh, spicy mornings; and eternal beams
	These are his due.


6. THEY ARE ALL GONE INTO THE WORLD OF LIGHT

	They are all gone into the world of light!
	And I alone sit ling’ring here;
	Their very memory is fair and bright,
	And my sad thoughts doth clear.
	It glows and glitters in my cloudy breast,
	Like stars upon some gloomy grove,
	Or those faint beams in which this hill is drest,
	After the sun’s remove.
	I see them walking in an air of glory,
	Whose light doth trample on my days:
	My days, which are at best but dull and hoary,
	Mere glimmering and decays.
	O holy Hope! and high Humility,
	High as the heavens above!
	These are your walks, and you have show’d them me
	To kindle my cold love.
	Dear, beauteous Death! the jewel of the just,
	Shining nowhere, but in the dark;
	What mysteries do lie beyond thy dust
	Could man outlook that mark!
	He that hath found some fledg’d bird’s nest, may know
	At first sight, if the bird be flown;
	But what fair well or grove he sings in now,
	That is to him unknown.
	And yet as angels in some brighter dreams
	Call to the soul, when man doth sleep:
	So some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes
	And into glory peep.
	If a star were confin’d into a tomb,
	Her captive flames must needs burn there;
	But when the hand that lock’d her up, gives room,
	She’ll shine through all the sphere.
	O Father of eternal life, and all
	Created glories under thee!
	Resume thy spirit from this world of thrall
	Into true liberty.
	Either disperse these mists, which blot and fill
	My perspective still as they pass,
	Or else remove me hence unto that hill,
	Where I shall need no glass.


7. UNPROFITABLENESS

	How rich, O Lord! how fresh thy visits are!
	‘Twas but just now my bleak leaves hopeless hung
	Sullied with dust and mud;
	Each snarling blast shot through me, and did share
	Their youth, and beauty, cold showers nipt, and wrung
	Their spiciness and blood;
	But since thou didst in one sweet glance survey
	Their sad decays, I flourish, and once more
	Breath all perfumes, and spice;
	I smell a dew like myrrh, and all the day
	Wear in my bosom a full sun; such store
	Hath one beam from thy eyes.
	But, ah, my God! what fruit hast thou of this?
	What one poor leaf did ever I yet fall
	To wait upon thy wreath?
	Thus thou all day a thankless weed dost dress,
	And when th’hast done, a stench or fog is all
	The odor I bequeath.


8. THE WATERFALL

	With what deep murmurs through time’s silent stealth
	Doth thy transparent, cool, and wat’ry wealth
	Here flowing fall,
	And chide, and call,
	As if his liquid, loose retinue stay’d
	Ling’ring, and were of this steep place afraid;
	The common pass
	Where, clear as glass,
	All must descend
	Not to an end,
	But quicken’d by this deep and rocky grave,
	Rise to a longer course more bright and brave.
	Dear stream! dear bank, where often I
	Have sate and pleas’d my pensive eye,
	Why, since each drop of thy quick store
	Runs thither whence it flow’d before,
	Should poor souls fear a shade or night,
	Who came, sure, from a sea of light?
	Or since those drops are all sent back
	So sure to thee, that none doth lack,
	Why should frail flesh doubt any more
	That what God takes, he’ll not restore?
	O useful element and clear!
	My sacred wash and cleanser here,
	My first consigner unto those
	Fountains of life where the Lamb goes!
	What sublime truths and wholesome themes
	Lodge in thy mystical deep streams!
	Such as dull man can never find
	Unless that Spirit lead his mind
	Which first upon thy face did move,
	And hatch’d all with his quick’ning love.
	As this loud brook’s incessant fall
	In streaming rings restagnates all,
	Which reach by course the bank, and then
	Are no more seen, just so pass men.
	O my invisible estate,
	My glorious liberty, still late!
	Thou art the channel my soul seeks,
	Not this with cataracts and creeks.
