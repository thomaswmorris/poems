*** Edward Lear (1812 - 1888)


1. THE COURTSHIP OF THE YONGHY-BONGHY-BÒ

	I

	On the Coast of Coromandel
	Where the early pumpkins blow,
	In the middle of the woods
	Lived the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.
	Two old chairs, and half a candle,--
	One old jug without a handle,--
	These were all his worldly goods:
	In the middle of the woods,
	These were all the worldly goods,
	Of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò,
	Of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.


	II

	Once, among the Bong-trees walking
	Where the early pumpkins blow,
	To a little heap of stones
	Came the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.
	There he heard a Lady talking,
	To some milk-white Hens of Dorking,--
	‘’Tis the lady Jingly Jones!
	‘On that little heap of stones
	‘Sits the Lady Jingly Jones!’
	Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò,
	Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.


	III

	‘Lady Jingly! Lady Jingly!
	‘Sitting where the pumpkins blow,
	‘Will you come and be my wife?’
	Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.
	‘I am tired of living singly,--
	‘On this coast so wild and shingly,--
	‘I’m a-weary of my life:
	‘If you’ll come and be my wife,
	‘Quite serene would be my life!’--
	Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò,
	Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.


	IV

	‘On this Coast of Coromandel,
	‘Shrimps and watercresses grow,
	‘Prawns are plentiful and cheap,’
	Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.
	‘You shall have my chairs and candle,
	‘And my jug without a handle!--
	‘Gaze upon the rolling deep
	(‘Fish is plentiful and cheap)
	‘As the sea, my love is deep!’
	Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò,
	Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.


	V

	Lady Jingly answered sadly,
	And her tears began to flow,--
	‘Your proposal comes too late,
	‘Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò!
	‘I would be your wife most gladly!’
	(Here she twirled her fingers madly,)
	‘But in England I’ve a mate!
	‘Yes! you’ve asked me far too late,
	‘For in England I’ve a mate,
	‘Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò!
	‘Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò!’


	VI

	‘Mr. Jones--(his name is Handel,--
	‘Handel Jones, Esquire, & Co.)
	‘Dorking fowls delights to send,
	‘Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò!
	‘Keep, oh! keep your chairs and candle,
	‘And your jug without a handle,--
	‘I can merely be your friend!
	‘-- Should my Jones more Dorkings send,
	‘I will give you three, my friend!
	‘Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò!
	‘Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò!’


	VII

	‘Though you’ve such a tiny body,
	‘And your head so large doth grow,--
	‘Though your hat may blow away,
	‘Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò!
	‘Though you’re such a Hoddy Doddy--
	‘Yet a wish that I could modi-
	‘fy the words I needs must say!
	‘Will you please to go away?
	‘That is all I have to say--
	‘Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò!
	‘Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò!’.


	VIII

	Down the slippery slopes of Myrtle,
	Where the early pumpkins blow,
	To the calm and silent sea
	Fled the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.
	There, beyond the Bay of Gurtle,
	Lay a large and lively Turtle,--
	‘You’re the Cove,’ he said, ‘for me
	‘On your back beyond the sea,
	‘Turtle, you shall carry me!’
	Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò,
	Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.


	IX

	Through the silent-roaring ocean
	Did the Turtle swiftly go;
	Holding fast upon his shell
	Rode the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.
	With a sad primæval motion
	Towards the sunset isles of Boshen
	Still the Turtle bore him well.
	Holding fast upon his shell,
	‘Lady Jingly Jones, farewell!’
	Sang the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò,
	Sang the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.


	X

	From the Coast of Coromandel,
	Did that Lady never go;
	On that heap of stones she mourns
	For the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.
	On that Coast of Coromandel,
	In his jug without a handle
	Still she weeps, and daily moans;
	On that little hep of stones
	To her Dorking Hens she moans,
	For the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò,
	For the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò.



2. THE DONG WITH THE LUMINOUS NOSE

	When awful darkness and silence reign
	Over the great Gromboolian plain,
	Through the long, long wintry nights;--
	When the angry breakers roar
	As they beat on the rocky shore;--
	When Storm-clouds brood on the towering heights
	Of the Hills of the Chankly Bore:--

	Then, through the vast and gloomy dark,
	There moves what seems a fiery spark,
	A lonely spark with silvery rays
	Piercing the coal-black night,--
	A Meteor strange and bright:--
	Hither and thither the vision strays,
	A single lurid light.

	Slowly it wander,--pauses,--creeps,--
	Anon it sparkles,--flashes and leaps;
	And ever as onward it gleaming goes
	A light on the Bong-tree stems it throws.
	And those who watch at that midnight hour
	From Hall or Terrace, or lofty Tower,
	Cry, as the wild light passes along,--
	“The Dong!--the Dong!
	“The wandering Dong through the forest goes!
	“The Dong! the Dong!
	“The Dong with a luminous Nose!”

	Long years ago
	The Dong was happy and gay,
	Till he fell in love with a Jumbly Girl
	Who came to those shores one day.
	For the Jumblies came in a sieve, they did,--
	Landing at eve near the Zemmery Fidd
	Where the Oblong Oysters grow,
	And the rocks are smooth and gray.
	And all the woods and the valleys rang
	With the Chorus they daily and nightly sang,--
	“Far and few, far and few,
	Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
	Their heads are green, and the hands are blue
	And they went to sea in a sieve.

	Happily, happily passed those days!
	While the cheerful Jumblies staid;
	They danced in circlets all night long,
	To the plaintive pipe of the lively Dong,
	In moonlight, shine, or shade.
	For day and night he was always there
	By the side of the Jumbly Girl so fair,
	With her sky-blue hands, and her sea-green hair.
	Till the morning came of that hateful day
	When the Jumblies sailed in their sieve away,
	And the Dong was left on the cruel shore
	Gazing--gazing for evermore,--
	Ever keeping his weary eyes on
	That pea-green sail on the far horizon,--
	Singing the Jumbly Chorus still
	As he sate all day on the grassy hill,--
	“Far and few, far and few,
	Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
	Their heads are green, and the hands are blue
	And they went to sea in a sieve.

	But when the sun was low in the West,
	The Dong arose and said;
	--“What little sense I once possessed
	Has quite gone out of my head!”--
	And since that day he wanders still
	By lake and forest, marsh and hills,
	Singing--“O somewhere, in valley or plain
	“Might I find my Jumbly Girl again!
	“For ever I’ll seek by lake and shore
	“Till I find my Jumbly Girl once more!”

	Playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,
	Since then his Jumbly Girl he seeks,
	And because by night he could not see,
	He gathered the bark of the Twangum Tree
	On the flowery plain that grows.
	And he wove him a wondrous Nose,--
	A Nose as strange as a Nose could be!
	Of vast proportions and painted red,
	And tied with cords to the back of his head.
	--In a hollow rounded space it ended
	With a luminous Lamp within suspended,
	All fenced about
	With a bandage stout
	To prevent the wind from blowing it out;--
	And with holes all round to send the light,
	In gleaming rays on the dismal night.

	And now each night, and all night long,
	Over those plains still roams the Dong;
	And above the wail of the Chimp and Snipe
	You may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe
	While ever he seeks, but seeks in vain
	To meet with his Jumbly Girl again;
	Lonely and wild--all night he goes,--
	The Dong with a luminous Nose!
	And all who watch at the midnight hour,
	From Hall or Terrace, or lofty Tower,
	Cry, as they trace the Meteor bright,
	Moving along through the dreary night,--
	“This is the hour when forth he goes,
	“The Dong with a luminous Nose!
	“Yonder--over the plain he goes;
	“He goes!
	“He goes;
	“The Dong with a luminous Nose!”



3. THE DUCK AND THE KANGAROO

	I

	Said the Duck to the Kangaroo,
	‘Good gracious! how you hop!
	Over the fields and the water too,
	As if you never would stop!
	My life is a bore in this nasty pond,
	And I long to go out in the world beyond!
	I wish I could hop like you!’
	Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.


	II

	‘Please give me a ride on your back!’
	Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.
	‘I would sit quite still, and say nothing but “Quack,”
	The whole of the long day through!
	And we’d go to the Dee, and the Jelly Bo Lee,
	Over the land, and over the sea;--
	Please take me a ride! O do!’
	Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.


	III

	Said the Kangaroo to the Duck,
	‘This requires some little reflection;
	Perhaps on the whole it might bring me luck,
	And there seems but one objection,
	Which is, if you’ll let me speak so bold,
	Your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold,
	And would probably give me the roo-
	Matiz!’ said the Kangaroo.


	IV

	Said the Duck, ‘As I sate on the rocks,
	I have thought over that completely,
	And I bought four pairs of worsted socks
	Which fit my web-feet neatly.
	And to keep out the cold I’ve bought a cloak,
	And every day a cigar I’ll smoke,
	All to follow my own dear true
	Love of a Kangaroo!’


	V

	Said the Kangaroo, ‘I’m ready!
	All in the moonlight pale;
	But to balance me well, dear Duck, sit steady!
	And quite at the end of my tail!’
	So away they went with a hop and a bound,
	And they hopped the whole world three times round;
	And who so happy,--O who,
	As the Duck and the Kangaroo?.



4. THE JUMBLIES

	I

	They went to sea in a sieve, they did;
	In a sieve they went to sea:
	In spite of all their friends could say,
	On a winter’s morn, on a stormy day,
	In a sieve they went to sea.
	And when the sieve turned round and round,
	And every one cried, “You’ll all be drowned!”
	They called aloud, “Our sieve ain’t big;
	But we don’t care a button, we don’t care a fig:
	In a sieve we’ll go to sea!”
	Far and few, far and few,
	Are the lands where the Jumblies live:
	Their heads are green, and their hands are blue
	And they went to sea in a sieve.


	II

	They sailed away in a sieve, they did,
	In a sieve they sailed so fast,
	With only a beautiful pea-green veil
	Tied with a ribbon, by way of a sail,
	To a small tobacco-pipe mast.
	And every one said who saw them go,
	“Oh! won’t they be soon upset, you know?
	For the sky is dark, and the voyage is long;
	And, happen what may, it’s extremely wrong
	In a sieve to sail so fast.”
	Far and few, far and few,
	Are the lands where the Jumblies live:
	Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;
	And they went to sea in a sieve.


	III

	The water it soon came in, it did;
	The water it soon came in:
	So, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet
	In a pinky paper all folded neat;
	And they fastened it down with a pin.
	And they passed the night in a crockery-jar;
	And each of them said, “How wise we are!
	Though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,
	Yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,
	While round in our sieve we spin.”
	Far and few, far and few,
	Are the lands where the Jumblies live:
	Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;
	And they went to sea in a sieve.


	IV

	And all night long they sailed away;
	And when the sun went down,
	They whistled and warbled a moony song
	To the echoing sound of a coppery gong,
	In the shade of the mountains brown.
	“O Timballoo! How happy we are
	When we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar!
	And all night long, in the moonlight pale,
	We sail away with a pea-green sail
	In the shade of the mountains brown.”
	Far and few, far and few,
	Are the lands where the Jumblies live:
	Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;
	And they went to sea in a sieve.


	V

	They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,--
	To a land all covered with trees:
	And they bought an owl, and a useful cart,
	And a pound of rice, and a cranberry-tart,
	And a hive of silvery bees;
	And they bought a pig, and some green jackdaws,
	And a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,
	And forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,
	And no end of Stilton cheese.
	Far and few, far and few,
	Are the lands where the Jumblies live:
	Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;
	And they went to sea in a sieve.


	VI

	And in twenty years they all came back,--
	In twenty years or more;
	And every one said, “How tall they’ve grown!
	For they’ve been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,
	And the hills of the Chankly Bore.”
	And they drank their health, and gave them a feast
	Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;
	And every one said, “If we only live,
	We, too, will go to sea in a sieve,
	To the hills of the Chankly Bore.”
	Far and few, far and few,
	Are the lands where the Jumblies live:
	Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;
	And they went to sea in a sieve.



5. THE OWL AND THE PUSSY-CAT

	I

	The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea
	In a beautiful pea-green boat,
	They took some honey, and plenty of money,
	Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
	The Owl looked up to the stars above,
	And sang to a small guitar,
	“O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,
	What a beautiful Pussy you are,
	You are,
	You are!
	What a beautiful Pussy you are!”


	II

	Pussy said to the Owl, “You elegant fowl!
	How charmingly sweet you sing!
	O let us be married! too long we have tarried:
	But what shall we do for a ring?”
	They sailed away, for a year and a day,
	To the land where the Bong-Tree grows
	And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood
	With a ring at the end of his nose,
	His nose,
	His nose,
	With a ring at the end of his nose.


	III

	“Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
	Your ring?” Said the Piggy, “I will.”
	So they took it away, and were married next day
	By the Turkey who lives on the hill.
	They dined on mince, and slices of quince,
	Which they ate with a runcible spoon;
	And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,
	They danced by the light of the moon,
	The moon,
	The moon,
	They danced by the light of the moon.



6. THE POBBLE WHO HAS NO TOES

	The Pobble who has no toes
	Had once as many as we;
	When they said “Some day you may lose them all;”
	He replied “Fish, fiddle-de-dee!”
	And his Aunt Jobiska made him drink
	Lavender water tinged with pink,
	For she said “The World in general knows
	There’s nothing so good for a Pobble’s toes!”

	The Pobble who has no toes
	Swam across the Bristol Channel;
	But before he set out he wrapped his nose
	In a piece of scarlet flannel.
	For his Aunt Jobiska said “No harm
	Can come to his toes if his nose is warm;
	And it’s perfectly known that a Pobble’s toes
	Are safe,--provided he minds his nose!”

	The Pobble swam fast and well,
	And when boats or ships came near him,
	He tinkledy-blinkledy-winkled a bell,
	So that all the world could hear him.
	And all the Sailors and Admirals cried,
	When they saw him nearing the further side--
	“He has gone to fish for his Aunt Jobiska’s
	Runcible Cat with crimson whiskers!”

	But before he touched the shore,
	The shore of the Bristol Channel,
	A sea-green porpoise carried away
	His wrapper of scarlet flannel.
	And when he came to observe his feet,
	Formerly garnished with toes so neat,
	His face at once became forlorn,
	On perceiving that all his toes were gone!

	And nobody ever knew,
	From that dark day to the present,
	Whoso had taken the Pobble’s toes,
	In a manner so far from pleasant.
	Whether the shrimps, or crawfish grey,
	Or crafty Mermaids stole them away--
	Nobody knew: and nobody knows
	How the Pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!

	The Pobble who has no toes
	Was placed in a friendly Bark,
	And they rowed him back, and carried him up
	To his Aunt Jobiska’s Park.
	And she made him a feast at his earnest wish
	Of eggs and buttercups fried with fish,--
	And she said “It’s a fact the whole world knows,
	That Pobbles are happier without their toes!”



7. THE QUANGLE WANGLE’S HAT

	I

	On the top of the Crumpetty Tree
	The Quangle Wangle sat,
	But his face you could not see,
	On account of his Beaver Hat.
	For his Hat was a hundred and two feet wide,
	With ribbons and bibbons on every side
	And bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace,
	So that nobody ever could see the face
	Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.


	II

	The Quangle Wangle said
	To himself on the Crumpetty Tree,--
	“Jam; and jelly; and bread;
	“Are the best of food for me!
	“But the longer I live on this Crumpetty Tree
	“The plainer than ever it seems to me
	“That very few people come this way
	“And that life on the whole is far from gay!”
	Said the Quangle Wangle Quee.


	III

	But there came to the Crumpetty Tree,
	Mr. and Mrs. Canary;
	And they said,--“Did ever you see
	“Any spot so charmingly airy?
	“May we build a nest on your lovely Hat?
	“Mr. Quangle Wangle, grant us that!
	“O please let us come and build a nest
	“Of whatever material suits you best,
	“Mr. Quangle Wangle Quee!”


	IV

	And besides, to the Crumpetty Tree
	Came the Stork, the Duck, and the Owl;
	The Snail, and the Bumble-Bee,
	The Frog, and the Fimble Fowl;
	(The Fimble Fowl, with a corkscrew leg;)
	And all of them said,--“We humbly beg,
	“We may build out homes on your lovely Hat,--
	“Mr. Quangle Wangle, grant us that!
	“Mr. Quangle Wangle Quee!”


	V

	And the Golden Grouse came there,
	And the Pobble who has no toes,--
	And the small Olympian bear,--
	And the Dong with a luminous nose.
	And the Blue Baboon, who played the Flute,--
	And the Orient Calf from the Land of Tute,--
	And the Attery Squash, and the Bisky Bat,--
	All came and built on the lovely Hat
	Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.


	VI

	And the Quangle Wangle said
	To himself on the Crumpetty Tree,--
	“When all these creatures move
	“What a wonderful noise there’ll be!”
	And at night by the light of the Mulberry moon
	They danced to the Flute of the Blue Baboon,
	On the broad green leaves of the Crumpetty Tree,
	And all were as happy as happy could be,
	With the Quangle Wangle Quee.



8. THE TABLE AND THE CHAIR

	I

	Said the Table to the Chair,
	‘You can hardly be aware,
	‘How I suffer from the heat,
	‘And from chilblains on my feet!
	‘If we took a little walk,
	‘We might have a little talk!
	‘Pray let us take the air!’
	Said the Table to the Chair.


	II

	Said the Chair unto the Table,
	‘Now you know we are not able!
	‘How foolishly you talk,
	‘When you know we cannot walk!’
	Said the Table, with a sigh,
	‘It can do no harm to try,
	‘I’ve as many legs as you,
	‘Why can’t we walk on two?’


	III

	So they both went slowly down,
	And walked about the town
	With a cheerful bumpy sound,
	As they toddled round and round.
	And everybody cried,
	As they hastened to their side,
	‘See! the Table and the Chair
	‘Have come out to take the air!’


	IV

	But in going down an alley,
	To a castle in a valley,
	They completely lost their way,
	And wandered all the day,
	Till, to see them safely back,
	They paid a Ducky-quack,
	And a Beetle, and a Mouse,
	Who took them to their house.


	V

	Then they whispered to each other,
	‘O delightful little brother!
	‘What a lovely walk we’ve taken!
	‘Let us dine on Beans and Bacon!’
	So the Ducky, and the leetle
	Browny-Mousy and the Beetle
	Dined, and danced upon their heads
	Till they toddled to their beds.
