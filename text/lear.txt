*** Edward Lear (1812 - 1888)


1. THE JUMBLIES

	I
	
	They went to sea in a sieve, they did;
	    In a sieve they went to sea:
	In spite of all their friends could say,
	On a winter’s morn, on a stormy day,
	    In a sieve they went to sea.
	And when the sieve turned round and round,
	And every one cried, “You’ll all be drowned!”
	They called aloud, “Our sieve ain’t big;
	But we don’t care a button, we don’t care a fig:
	    In a sieve we’ll go to sea!”
	         Far and few, far and few,
	    Are the lands where the Jumblies live:
	         Their heads are green, and their hands are blue
	    And they went to sea in a sieve.
	
	
	II
	
	They sailed away in a sieve, they did,
	    In a sieve they sailed so fast,
	With only a beautiful pea-green veil
	Tied with a ribbon, by way of a sail,
	    To a small tobacco-pipe mast.
	And every one said who saw them go,
	“Oh! won’t they be soon upset, you know?
	For the sky is dark, and the voyage is long;
	And, happen what may, it’s extremely wrong
	    In a sieve to sail so fast.”
	        Far and few, far and few,
	    Are the lands where the Jumblies live:
	        Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;
	    And they went to sea in a sieve.

	The water it soon came in, it did;
	    The water it soon came in:
	So, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet
	    In a pinky paper all folded neat;
	And they fastened it down with a pin.
	And they passed the night in a crockery-jar;
	And each of them said, “How wise we are!
	Though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,
	Yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,
	    While round in our sieve we spin.”
	        Far and few, far and few,
	    Are the lands where the Jumblies live:
	        Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;
	    And they went to sea in a sieve.
	
	
	IV
	
	And all night long they sailed away;
	    And when the sun went down,
	They whistled and warbled a moony song
	    To the echoing sound of a coppery gong,
	In the shade of the mountains brown.
	“O Timballoo! How happy we are
	When we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar!
	And all night long, in the moonlight pale,
	We sail away with a pea-green sail
	    In the shade of the mountains brown.”
	        Far and few, far and few,
	    Are the lands where the Jumblies live:
	        Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;
	    And they went to sea in a sieve.
	
	
	V
	
	They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,--
	    To a land all covered with trees:
	And they bought an owl, and a useful cart,
	    And a pound of rice, and a cranberry-tart,
	And a hive of silvery bees;
	And they bought a pig, and some green jackdaws,
	And a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,
	And forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,
	    And no end of Stilton cheese.
	        Far and few, far and few,
	    Are the lands where the Jumblies live:
	        Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;
	    And they went to sea in a sieve.
	
	
	VI
	
	And in twenty years they all came back,--
	    In twenty years or more;
	And every one said, “How tall they’ve grown!
	    For they’ve been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,
	And the hills of the Chankly Bore.”
	And they drank their health, and gave them a feast
	Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;
	And every one said, “If we only live,
	We, too, will go to sea in a sieve,
	    To the hills of the Chankly Bore.”
	        Far and few, far and few,
	    Are the lands where the Jumblies live:
	        Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;
	    And they went to sea in a sieve.


2. THE OWL AND THE PUSSY-CAT

	I
	
	The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea 
	  In a beautiful pea-green boat, 
	They took some honey, and plenty of money, 
	  Wrapped up in a five-pound note. 
	The Owl looked up to the stars above, 
	  And sang to a small guitar, 
	“O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love, 
	   What a beautiful Pussy you are, 
	        You are, 
	        You are! 
	What a beautiful Pussy you are!” 
	
	
	II
	
	Pussy said to the Owl, “You elegant fowl! 
	  How charmingly sweet you sing! 
	O let us be married! too long we have tarried: 
	  But what shall we do for a ring?” 
	They sailed away, for a year and a day, 
	  To the land where the Bong-Tree grows 
	And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood 
	  With a ring at the end of his nose, 
	            His nose, 
	            His nose, 
	  With a ring at the end of his nose. 
	
	
	III
	
	“Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling 
	  Your ring?” Said the Piggy, “I will.” 
	So they took it away, and were married next day 
	  By the Turkey who lives on the hill. 
	They dined on mince, and slices of quince, 
	  Which they ate with a runcible spoon; 
	And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, 
	  They danced by the light of the moon, 
	            The moon, 
	            The moon, 
	They danced by the light of the moon.
