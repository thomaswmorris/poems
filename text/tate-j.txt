1. FUCK THE ASTRONAUTS

	I
	
	Eventually we must combine nightmares
	an angel smoking a cigarette on the steps
	of the last national bank, said to me.
	I put her out with my thumb. I don’t need that
	cheap talk I’ve got my own problems.
	It was sad, exciting, and horrible.
	It was exciting, horrible, and sad.
	It was horrible, sad, and exciting.
	It was inviting, mad, and deplorable.
	It was adorable, glad, and enticing.
	Eventually we must smoke a thumb
	cheap talk I’ve got my own angel
	on the steps of the problems the bank
	said to me I don’t need that.
	I will take this one window
	with its sooty maps and scratches
	so that my dreams will remember
	one another and so that my eyes will not
	become blinded by the new world.

	The flames don’t dance or slither.
	They have painted the room green.
	Beautiful and naked, the wives
	are sleeping before the fire.
	Now it is out. The men have
	returned to the shacks,
	slaved creatures from the forest
	floor across their white
	stationwagons. That just about
	does it, says the other,
	dumping her bucket
	over her head. Well, I guess
	we got everything, says one,
	feeling around in the mud,
	as if for a child.
	Now they remember they want
	that mud, who can’t remember
	what they got up for.
	They parcel it out: when
	they are drunk enough
	they go into town with
	a bucket of mud, saying
	we can slice it up into
	windmills like a bloated cow. 
	Later, they paint the insides
	of the shack black,
	and sit sucking eggs all night,
	they want something real, useful,
	but there isn’t anything.

	I will engineer the sunrise
	they have disassembled our shadows
	our echoes are erased from the walls
	your nipples are the skeletons of olives
	your nipples are an oriental delight
	your nipples blow away like cigarette papers
	your nipples are the mouths of mutes
	so I am not here any longer
	skein of lightning
	memory’s dark ink in your last smile
	where the stars have swallowed their train schedule
	where the stars have drowned in their dark petticoats
	like a sock of hamburger
	receiving the lightning
	into his clitoris
	red on red the prisoner
	confesses his waltz
	through the corkscrew lightning
	nevermind the lightning
	in your teeth let’s waltz
	I am the hashish pinball machine
	that rapes a piano.


2. IT HAPPENS LIKE THIS

	I was outside St. Cecelia’s Rectory
	smoking a cigarette when a goat appeared beside me.
	It was mostly black and white, with a little reddish
	brown here and there. When I started to walk away,
	it followed. I was amused and delighted, but wondered
	what the laws were on this kind of thing. There’s
	a leash law for dogs, but what about goats? People
	smiled at me and admired the goat. “It’s not my goat,”
	I explained. “It’s the town’s goat. I’m just taking
	my turn caring for it.” “I didn’t know we had a goat,”
	one of them said. “I wonder when my turn is.” “Soon,”
	I said. “Be patient. Your time is coming.” The goat
	stayed by my side. It stopped when I stopped. It looked
	up at me and I stared into its eyes. I felt he knew
	everything essential about me. We walked on. A police-
	man on his beat looked us over. “That’s a mighty
	fine goat you got there,” he said, stopping to admire.
	“It’s the town’s goat,” I said. “His family goes back
	three-hundred years with us,” I said, “from the beginning.”
	The officer leaned forward to touch him, then stopped
	and looked up at me. “Mind if I pat him?” he asked.
	“Touching this goat will change your life,” I said.
	“It’s your decision.” He thought real hard for a minute,
	and then stood up and said, “What’s his name?” “He’s
	called the Prince of Peace,” I said. “God! This town
	is like a fairy tale. Everywhere you turn there’s mystery 
	and wonder. And I’m just a child playing cops and robbers
	forever. Please forgive me if I cry.” “We forgive you,
	Officer,” I said. “And we understand why you, more than
	anybody, should never touch the Prince.” The goat and
	I walked on. It was getting dark and we were beginning
	to wonder where we would spend the night.


3. THE LIST OF FAMOUS HATS

	Napoleon’s hat is an obvious choice I guess to list as a famous hat, but that’s not the hat I have in 
	mind. That was his hat for show. I am thinking of his private bathing cap, which in all honesty 
	wasn’t much different than the one any jerk might buy at a corner drugstore now, except for two 
	minor eccentricities. The first one isn’t even funny: Simply it was a white rubber bathing cap, but 
	too small. Napoleon led such a hectic life ever since his childhood, even farther back than that, that 
	he never had a chance to buy a new bathing cap and still as a grown-up--well, he didn’t really grow 
	that much, but his head did: He was a pinhead at birth, and he used, until his death really, the same 
	little tiny bathing cap that he was born in, and this meant that later it was very painful to him and 
	gave him many headaches, as if he needed more. So, he had to vaseline his skull like crazy to even 
	get the thing on. The second eccentricity was that it was a tricorn bathing cap. Scholars like to 
	make a lot out of this, and it would be easy to do. My theory is simple-minded to be sure: that 
	beneath his public head there was another head and it was a pyramid or something.


4. THE LOST PILOT

	_for my father, 1922--1944_
	
	Your face did not rot 
	like the others--the co-pilot, 
	for example, I saw him
	
	yesterday. His face is corn-
	mush: his wife and daughter, 
	the poor ignorant people, stare
	
	as if he will compose soon. 
	He was more wronged than Job. 
	But your face did not rot
	
	like the others--it grew dark, 
	and hard like ebony; 
	the features progressed in their
	
	distinction. If I could cajole 
	you to come back for an evening, 
	down from your compulsive
	
	orbiting, I would touch you, 
	read your face as Dallas, 
	your hoodlum gunner, now,
	
	with the blistered eyes, reads 
	his braille editions. I would 
	touch your face as a disinterested
	
	scholar touches an original page. 
	However frightening, I would 
	discover you, and I would not
	
	turn you in; I would not make 
	you face your wife, or Dallas,
	or the co-pilot, Jim. You
	
	could return to your crazy 
	orbiting, and I would not try 
	to fully understand what
	
	it means to you. All I know 
	is this: when I see you, 
	as I have seen you at least
	
	once every year of my life, 
	spin across the wilds of the sky 
	like a tiny, African god,
	
	I feel dead. I feel as if I were 
	the residue of a stranger’s life, 
	that I should pursue you.
	
	My head cocked toward the sky, 
	I cannot get off the ground, 
	and, you, passing over again,
	
	fast, perfect, and unwilling 
	to tell me that you are doing 
	well, or that it was mistake
	
	that placed you in that world, 
	and me in this; or that misfortune 
	placed these worlds in us.


5. SUCCESS COMES TO COW CREEK

	I sit on the tracks, 
	a hundred feet from
	earth, fifty from the
	water. Gerald is
	inching toward me
	as grim, slow, and
	determined as a
	season, because he
	has no trade and wants 
	none. It’s been nine months 
	since I last listened 
	to his fate, but I
	know what he will say:
	he’s the fire hydrant
	of the underdog.
	
	When he reaches my
	point above the creek,
	he sits down without
	salutation, and
	spits profoundly out
	past the edge, and peeks
	for meaning in the
	ripple it brings. He
	scowls. He speaks: when you 
	walk down any street 
	you see nothing but
	coagulations
	of shit and vomit,
	and I’m sick of it.
	I suggest suicide;
	he prefers murder, 
	and spits again for 
	the sake of all the 
	great devout losers.
	
	A conductor’s horn 
	concerto breaks the 
	air, and we, two doomed 
	pennies on the track, 
	shove off and somersault 
	like anesthetized 
	fleas, ruffling the 
	ideal locomotive 
	poised on the water 
	with our light, dry bodies. 
	Gerald shouts 
	terrifically as
	he sails downstream like 
	a young man with a 
	destination. I 
	swim toward shore as 
	fast as my boots will 
	allow; as always, 
	neglecting to drown.


6. THE WRONG WAY HOME

	All night a door floated down the river.
	It tried to remember little incidents of pleasure
	from its former life, like the time the lovers
	leaned against it kissing for hours
	and whispering those famous words.
	Later, there were harsh words and a shoe
	was thrown and the door was slammed.
	Comings and goings by the thousands,
	the early mornings and late nights, years, years.
	O they’ve got big plans, they’ll make a bundle.
	The door was an island that swayed in its sleep.
	The moon turned the doorknob just slightly,
	burned its fingers and ran,
	and still the door said nothing and slept.
	At least that’s what they like to say,
	the little fishes and so on.
	Far away, a bell rang, and then a shot was fired.
