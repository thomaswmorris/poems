*** Denise Levertov (1923 - 1997)


1. THE ACHE OF MARRIAGE

	The ache of marriage:
	
	thigh and tongue, beloved,
	are heavy with it,
	it throbs in the teeth
	
	We look for communion
	and are turned away, beloved,
	each and each
	
	It is leviathan and we
	in its belly
	looking for joy, some joy
	not to be known outside it
	
	two by two in the ark of
	the ache of it.



2. ADAM’S COMPLAINT

	Some people, 
	no matter what you give them,
	still want the moon.
	
	The bread, 
	the salt, 
	white meat and dark,
	still hungry.
	
	The marriage bed 
	and the cradle,
	still empty arms.
	
	You give them land, 
	their own earth under their feet,
	still they take to the roads
	
	And water: dig them the deepest well, 
	still it’s not deep enough
	to drink the moon from.



3. THE BREATHING

	An absolute
	patience.
	Trees stand
	up to their knees in
	fog. The fog
	slowly flows
	uphill.
	White
	cobwebs, the grass 
	leaning where deer 
	have looked for apples.
	The woods
	from brook to where
	the top of the hill looks
	over the fog, send up
	not one bird.
	So absolute, it is
	no other than
	happiness itself, a breathing
	too quiet to hear.



4. CELEBRATION

	Brilliant, this day--a young virtuoso of a day.
	Morning shadow cut by sharpest scissors,
	deft hands. And every prodigy of green--
	whether it’s ferns or lichens or needles
	or impatient points of buds on spindly bushes--
	greener than ever before. And the way the conifers
	hold new cones to the light for the blessing,
	a festive right, and sing the oceanic chant the wind
	transcribes for them!
	A day that shines in the cold
	like a first-prize brass band swinging along
	the street
	of a coal-dusty village, wholly at odds
	with the claims of reasonable gloom.
	
	 
	*** THE GREAT BLACK HERON
	{}
	
	Since I stroll in the woods more often
	than on this frequented path, it’s usually
	trees I observe; but among fellow humans
	what I like best is to see an old woman
	fishing alone at the end of a jetty,
	hours on end, plainly content.
	The Russians mushroom-hunting after a rain
	trail after themselves a world of red sarafans,
	nightingales, samovars, stoves to sleep on
	(though without doubt those are not
	what they can remember). Vietnamese families
	fishing or simply sitting as close as they can
	to the water, make me recall that lake in Hanoi
	in the amber light, our first, jet-lagged evening,
	peace in the war we had come to witness.
	This woman engaged in her pleasure evokes
	an entire culture, tenacious field-flower
	growing itself among the rows of cotton
	in red-earth country, under the feet
	of mules and masters. I see her
	a barefoot child by a muddy river
	learning her skill with the pole. What battles
	has she survived, what labors?
	She’s gathered up all the time in the world
	--nothing else--and waits for scanty trophies,
	complete in herself as a heron.



5. CONTRABAND

	The tree of knowledge was the tree of reason.
	That’s why the taste of it
	drove us from Eden. That fruit
	was meant to be dried and milled to a fine powder
	for use a pinch at a time, a condiment.
	God had probably planned to tell us later
	about this new pleasure.
	
	We stuffed our mouths full of it,
	gorged on but and if and how and again
	but, knowing no better.
	It’s toxic in large quantities; fumes
	swirled in our heads and around us
	to form a dense cloud that hardened to steel,
	a wall between us and God, Who was Paradise.
	Not that God is unreasonable--but reason
	in such excess was tyranny
	and locked us into its own limits, a polished cell
	reflecting our own faces. God lives
	on the other side of that mirror,
	but through the slit where the barrier doesn’t
	quite touch ground, manages still
	to squeeze in--as filtered light,
	splinters of fire, a strain of music heard
	then lost, then heard again.



6. EVERYTHING THAT ACTS IS ACTUAL

	From the tawny light
	from the rainy nights
	from the imagination finding
	itself and more than itself
	alone and more than alone
	at the bottom of the well where the moon lives,
	can you pull me
	
	into December? a lowland
	of space, perception of space
	towering of shadows of clouds blown upon
	clouds over new ground, new made
	under heavy December footsteps? the only
	way to live?
	
	The flawed moon
	acts on the truth, and makes
	an autumn of tentative silences.
	You lived, but somewhere else,
	your presence touched others, ring upon ring,
	and changed. Did you think
	I would not change?
	
	The black moon
	turns away, its work done. A tenderness,
	unspoken autumn.
	We are faithful
	only to the imagination. What the
	imagination seizes
	as beauty must be truth. What holds you
	to what you see of me is
	that grasp alone.



7. FEBRUARY EVENING IN NEW YORK

	As the stores close, a winter light
	   opens air to iris blue,
	   glint of frost through the smoke
	   grains of mica, salt of the sidewalk.
	As the buildings close, released autonomous   
	   feet pattern the streets
	   in hurry and stroll; balloon heads
	   drift and dive above them; the bodies   
	   aren’t really there.
	As the lights brighten, as the sky darkens,
	   a woman with crooked heels says to another woman   
	   while they step along at a fair pace,
	   “You know, I’m telling you, what I love best   
	   is life. I love life! Even if I ever get
	   to be old and wheezy--or limp! You know?   
	   Limping along?--I’d still ... ” Out of hearing.   
	To the multiple disordered tones
	   of gears changing, a dance
	   to the compass points, out, four-way river.   
	   Prospect of sky
	   wedged into avenues, left at the ends of streets,   
	   west sky, east sky: more life tonight! A range   
	   of open time at winter’s outskirts.



8. FROM THE ROOF

	This wild night, gathering the washing as if it were flowers
	   animal vines twisting over the line and
	   slapping my face lightly, soundless merriment
	   in the gesticulations of shirtsleeves,
	I recall out of my joy a night of misery
	
	walking in the dark and the wind over broken earth,
	   halfmade foundations and unfinished
	   drainage trenches and the spaced-out
	      circles of glaring light
	   marking streets that were to be
	walking with you but so far from you, 
	
	and now alone in October’s 
	first decision towards winter, so close to you--
	   my arms full of playful rebellious linen, a freighter
	   going down-river two blocks away, outward bound,
	   the green wolf-eyes of the Harborside Terminal
	      glittering on the Jersey shore,
	and a train somewhere under ground bringing you towards me
	to our new living-place from which we can see
	
	a river and its traffic (the Hudson and the
	hidden river, who can say which it is we see, we see
	something of both. Or who can say
	the crippled broom-vendor yesterday, who passed
	just as we needed a new broom, was not
	one of the Hidden Ones?)
	   Crates of fruit are unloading
	   across the street on the cobbles,
	   and a brazier flaring
	   to warm the men and burn trash. He wished us
	luck when we bought the broom. But not luck 
	brought us here.  By design
	
	clean air and cold wind polish 
	the river lights, by design
	we are to live now in a new place.



9. THE HARROWING OF HELL

	Down through the tomb’s inward arch
	He has shouldered out into Limbo
	to gather them, dazed, from dreamless slumber:
	the merciful dead, the prophets,
	the innocents just His own age and those
	unnumbered others waiting here
	unaware, in an endless void He is ending
	now, stooping to tug at their hands,
	to pull them from their sarcophagi,
	dazzled, almost unwilling. Didmas,
	neighbor in death, Golgotha dust
	still streaked on the dried sweat of his body
	no one had washed and anointed, is here,
	for sequence is not known in Limbo;
	the promise, given from cross to cross
	at noon, arches beyond sunset and dawn.
	All these He will swiftly lead
	to the Paradise road: they are safe.
	That done, there must take place that struggle
	no human presumes to picture:
	living, dying, descending to rescue the just
	from shadow, were lesser travails
	than this: to break
	through earth and stone of the faithless world
	back to the cold sepulchre, tearstained
	stifling shroud; to break from them
	back into breath and heartbeat, and walk
	the world again, closed into days and weeks again,
	wounds of His anguish open, and Spirit
	streaming through every cell of flesh
	so that if mortal sight could bear
	to perceive it, it would be seen
	His mortal flesh was lit from within, now,
	and aching for home. He must return,
	first, in Divine patience, and know
	hunger again, and give
	to humble friends the joy
	of giving Him food--fish and a honeycomb.



10. ILLUSTRIOUS ANCESTORS

	The Rav
	of Northern White Russia declined,
	in his youth, to learn the
	language of birds, because
	the extraneous did not interest him; nevertheless
	when he grew old it was found
	he understood them anyway, having
	listened well, and as it is said, ‘prayed with the bench and the floor.’ He used
	what was at hand--as did
	Angel Jones of Mold, whose meditations
	were sewn into coats and britches.
	
	Well, I would like to make,
	thinking some line still taut between me and them,
	poems direct as what the birds said,
	hard as a floor, sound as a bench,
	mysterious as the silence when the tailor
	would pause with his needle in the air.



11. IN CALIFORNIA: MORNING, EVENING, LATE JANUARY

	Pale, then enkindled,
	light
	advancing,
	emblazoning
	summits of palm and pine,
	
	the dew
	lingering,
	scripture of
	scintillas.
	
	Soon the roar
	of mowers
	cropping the already short
	grass of lawns,
	
	men with long-nozzled
	cylinders of pesticide
	poking at weeds,
	at moss in cracks of cement,
	
	and louder roar
	of helicopters off to spray
	vineyards where braceros try
	to hold their breath,
	
	and in the distance, bulldozers, excavators,
	babel of destructive construction.
	
	Banded by deep
	oakshadow, airy
	shadow of eucalyptus,
	
	miner’s lettuce,
	tender, untasted,
	and other grass, unmown,
	luxuriant,
	no green more brilliant.
	
	Fragile paradise.
	
	        .   .   .   .
	
	At day’s end the whole sky,
	vast, unstinting, flooded with transparent
	mauve,
	tint of wisteria,
	cloudless
	over the malls, the industrial parks,
	the homes with the lights going on,
	the homeless arranging their bundles.
	
	        .   .   .   .
	
	Who can utter
	the poignance of all that is constantly
	threatened, invaded, expended
	
	and constantly
	nevertheless
	persists in beauty,
	
	tranquil as this young moon
	just risen and slowly
	drinking light   
	from the vanished sun.
	
	Who can utter
	the praise of such generosity
	or the shame?



12. IN MIND

	There’s in my mind a woman
	of innocence, unadorned but
	
	fair-featured and smelling of
	apples or grass. She wears
	
	a utopian smock or shift, her hair
	is light brown and smooth, and she
	
	is kind and very clean without
	ostentation--
	
	but she has
	no imagination
	
	And there’s a
	turbulent moon-ridden girl
	
	or old woman, or both,
	dressed in opals and rags, feathers
	
	and torn taffeta,
	who knows strange songs
	
	but she is not kind.



13. INTRUSION

	After I had cut off my hands
	and grown new ones
	
	something my former hands had longed for
	came and asked to be rocked.
	
	After my plucked out eyes
	had withered, and new ones grown
	
	something my former eyes had wept for
	came asking to be pitied.



14. LIVING

	The fire in leaf and grass
	so green it seems
	each summer the last summer.
	
	The wind blowing, the leaves
	shivering in the sun,
	each day the last day.
	
	A red salamander
	so cold and so
	easy to catch, dreamily
	
	moves his delicate feet
	and long tail. I hold
	my hand open for him to go.
	
	Each minute the last minute.



15. LOSING TRACK

	Long after you have swung back
	away from me
	I think you are still with me:
	
	you come in close to the shore
	on the tide
	and nudge me awake the way
	
	a boat adrift nudges the pier:
	am I a pier
	half-in half-out of the water?
	
	and in the pleasure of that communion
	I lose track,
	the moon I watch goes down, the
	
	tide swings you away before
	I know I’m
	alone again long since,
	
	mud sucking at gray and black
	timbers of me,
	a light growth of green dreams drying.



16. MATINS

	I
	
	The authentic! Shadows of it 
	sweep past in dreams, one could say imprecisely, 
	evoking the almost-silent 
	ripping apart of giant 
	sheets of cellophane. No. 
	It thrusts up close. Exactly in dreams 
	it has you off-guard, you 
	recognize it before you have time. 
	For a second before waking 
	the alarm bell is a red conical hat, it 
	takes form. 
	
	
	II
	
	The authentic! I said 
	rising from the toilet seat. 
	The radiator in rhythmic knockings 
	spoke of the rising steam. 
	The authentic, I said 
	breaking the handle of my hairbrush as I 
	brushed my hair in 
	rhythmic strokes: That’s it, 
	that’s joy, it’s always 
	a recognition, the known 
	appearing fully itself, and 
	more itself than one knew. 
	
	
	III
	
	The new day rises 
	as heat rises, 
	knocking in the pipes 
	with rhythms it seizes for its own 
	to speak of its invention--
	the real, the new-laid 
	egg whose speckled shell 
	the poet fondles and must break 
	if he will be nourished. 
	
	
	IV
	
	A shadow painted where 
	yes, a shadow must fall. 
	The cow’s breath 
	not forgotten in the mist, in the 
	words. Yes, 
	verisimilitude draws up 
	heat in us, zest 
	to follow through, 
	follow through, 
	follow 
	transformations of day 
	in its turning, in its becoming. 
	
	
	V
	
	Stir the holy grains, set 
	the bowls on the table and 
	call the child to eat. 
	
	While we eat we think, 
	as we think an undercurrent 
	of dream runs through us 
	faster than thought 
	towards recognition. 
	
	Call the child to eat, 
	send him off, his mouth 
	tasting of toothpaste, to go down 
	into the ground, into a roaring train 
	and to school. 
	
	His cheeks are pink 
	his black eyes hold his dreams, he has left 
	forgetting his glasses. 
	
	Follow down the stairs at a clatter 
	to give them to him and save 
	his clear sight. 
	
	Cold air 
	comes in at the street door. 
	
	
	VI
	
	The authentic! It rolls 
	just out of reach, beyond 
	running feet and 
	stretching fingers, down 
	the green slope and into 
	the black waves of the sea. 
	Speak to me, little horse, beloved, 
	tell me 
	how to follow the iron ball, 
	how to follow through to the country 
	beneath the waves 
	to the place where I must kill you and you step out 
	of your bones and flystrewn meat 
	tall, smiling, renewed, 
	formed in your own likeness. 
	
	
	VII
	
	Marvelous Truth, confront us 
	at every turn, 
	in every guise, iron ball, 
	egg, dark horse, shadow, 
	cloud 
	of breath on the air, 
	
	dwell 
	in our crowded hearts 
	our steaming bathrooms, kitchens full of 
	things to be done, the 
	ordinary streets. 
	
	Thrust close your smile 
	that we know you, terrible joy.



17. THE MUTES

	Those groans men use
	passing a woman on the street
	or on the steps of the subway
	
	to tell her she is a female
	and their flesh knows it,
	
	are they a sort of tune,
	an ugly enough song, sung
	by a bird with a slit tongue
	
	but meant for music?
	
	Or are they the muffled roaring
	of deafmutes trapped in a building that is
	slowly filling with smoke?
	
	Perhaps both.
	
	Such men most often 
	look as if groan were all they could do,
	yet a woman, in spite of herself,
	
	knows it’s a tribute:
	if she were lacking all grace
	they’d pass her in silence:
	
	so it’s not only to say she’s
	a warm hole. It’s a word
	
	in grief-language, nothing to do with
	primitive, not an ur-language;
	language stricken, sickened, cast down
	
	in decrepitude. She wants to
	throw the tribute away, dis-
	gusted, and can’t,
	
	it goes on buzzing in her ear,
	it changes the pace of her walk,
	the torn posters in echoing corridors
	
	spell it out, it
	quakes and gnashes as the train comes in.
	Her pulse sullenly
	
	had picked up speed,
	but the cars slow down and
	jar to a stop while her understanding
	
	keeps on translating:
	‘Life after life after life goes by
	
	without poetry,
	without seemliness,
	without love.’



18. MY WEDDING-RING

	My wedding-ring lies in a basket 
	as if at the bottom of a well. 
	Nothing will come to fish it back up 
	and onto my finger again. 
	      It lies 
	among keys to abandoned houses, 
	nails waiting to be needed and hammered 
	into some wall, 
	telephone numbers with no names attached, 
	idle paperclips. 
	      It can’t be given away 
	for fear of bringing ill-luck. 
	      It can’t be sold 
	for the marriage was good in its own 
	time, though that time is gone. 
	      Could some artificer 
	beat into it bright stones, transform it 
	into a dazzling circlet no one could take 
	for solemn betrothal or to make promises 
	living will not let them keep? Change it 
	into a simple gift I could give in friendship?



19. THE MÉTIER OF BLOSSOMING

	Fully occupied with growing--that’s
	the amaryllis. Growing especially
	at night: it would take
	only a bit more patience than I’ve got
	to sit keeping watch with it till daylight;
	the naked eye could register every hour’s
	increase in height. Like a child against a barn door,
	proudly topping each year’s achievement,
	steadily up
	goes each green stem, smooth, matte,
	traces of reddish purple at the base, and almost
	imperceptible vertical ridges
	running the length of them:
	Two robust stems from each bulb,
	sometimes with sturdy leaves for company,
	elegant sweeps of blade with rounded points.
	Aloft, the gravid buds, shiny with fullness.
	
	One morning--and so soon!--the first flower
	has opened when you wake. Or you catch it poised
	in a single, brief
	moment of hesitation.
	Next day, another,
	shy at first like a foal,
	even a third, a fourth,
	carried triumphantly at the summit
	of those strong columns, and each
	a Juno, calm in brilliance,
	a maiden giantess in modest splendor.
	If humans could be
	that intensely whole, undistracted, unhurried,
	swift from sheer
	unswerving impetus! If we could blossom
	out of ourselves, giving
	nothing imperfect, withholding nothing!



20. PLEASURES

	I like to find
	what’s not found
	at once, but lies
	
	within something of another nature,
	in repose, distinct.
	Gull feathers of glass, hidden
	
	in white pulp: the bones of squid
	which I pull out and lay
	blade by blade on the draining board--
	
	tapered as if for swiftness, to pierce
	the heart, but fragile, substance
	belying design. Or a fruit, mamey,
	
	cased in rough brown peel, the flesh
	rose-amber, and the seed:
	the seed a stone of wood, carved and
	
	polished, walnut-colored, formed
	like a brazilnut, but large,
	large enough to fill
	the hungry palm of a hand.
	
	I like the juicy stem of grass that grows
	within the coarser leaf folded round,
	and the butteryellow glow
	
	in the narrow flute from which the morning-glory
	opens blue and cool on a hot morning.



21. PSALM CONCERNING THE CASTLE

	Let me be at the place of the castle.
	Let the castle be within me.
	Let it rise foursquare from the moat’s ring.
	Let the moat’s waters reflect green plumage of ducks, let
	  the shells of swimming turtles break the surface or be
	  seen through the rippling depths.
	Let horsemen be stationed at the rim of it, and a dog,
	  always alert on the brink of sleep.
	Let the space under the first storey be dark, let the water
	  lap the stone posts, and vivid green slime glimmer upon
	  them; let a boat be kept there.
	Let the caryatids of the second storey be bears upheld on
	  beams that are dragons.
	On the parapet of the central room, let there be four
	  archers, looking off to the four horizons. Within, let
	  the prince be at home, let him sit in deep thought, at
	  peace, all the windows open to the loggias.
	Let the young queen sit above, in the cool air, her child in
	  her arms; let her look with joy at the great circle, the
	  pilgrim shadows, the work of the sun and the play of
	  the wind. Let her walk to and fro. Let the columns uphold
	  the roof, let the storeys uphold the columns, let there
	  be dark space below the lowest floor, let the castle rise
	  foursquare out of the moat, let the moat be a ring and
	  the water deep, let the guardians guard it, let there be
	  wide lands around it, let that country where it stands be
	  within me, let me be where it is.
	  



22. THE QUEST

	High, hollowed in green
	above the rocks of reason
	lies the crater lake
	whose ice the dreamer breaks
	to find a summer season.
	
	‘He will plunge like a plummet down
	far into hungry tides’
	they cry, but as the sea
	climbs to a lunar magnet
	so the dreamer pursues
	the lake where love resides.



23. SAINT PETER AND THE ANGEL

	Delivered out of raw continual pain,
	smell of darkness, groans of those others
	to whom he was chained--
	
	unchained, and led
	past the sleepers,
	door after door silently opening--
	out!
	     And along a long street’s
	majestic emptiness under the moon:
	
	one hand on the angel’s shoulder, one
	feeling the air before him,
	eyes open but fixed . . .
	
	And not till he saw the angel had left him,
	alone and free to resume
	the ecstatic, dangerous, wearisome roads of
	what he had still to do,
	not till then did he recognize
	this was no dream. More frightening
	than arrest, than being chained to his warders:
	he could hear his own footsteps suddenly.
	Had the angel’s feet
	made any sound? He could not recall.
	No one had missed him, no one was in pursuit.
	He himself must be
	the key, now, to the next door,
	the next terrors of freedom and joy.



24. THE SECRET

	Two girls discover
	the secret of life
	in a sudden line of
	poetry.
	
	I who don’t know the
	secret wrote
	the line. They
	told me
	
	(through a third person)
	they had found it
	but not what it was
	not even
	
	what line it was. No doubt
	by now, more than a week
	later, they have forgotten
	the secret,
	
	the line, the name of
	the poem. I love them
	for finding what
	I can’t find,
	
	and for loving me
	for the line I wrote,
	and for forgetting it
	so that
	
	a thousand times, till death
	finds them, they may
	discover it again, in other
	lines
	
	in other
	happenings. And for
	wanting to know it,
	for
	
	assuming there is
	such a secret, yes,
	for that
	most of all.



25. SEEING FOR A MOMENT

	I thought I was growing wings--
	it was a cocoon.
	
	I thought, now is the time to step
	into the fire--
	it was deep water.
	
	Eschatology is a word I learned
	as a child: the study of Last Things;
	
	facing my mirror--no longer young,
	   the news--always of death,
	   the dogs--rising from sleep and clamoring
	   and howling, howling,
	
	nevertheless
	I see for a moment
	that’s not it: it is
	the First Things.
	
	Word after word
	floats through the glass.
	Towards me.



26. SEEMS LIKE WE MUST BE SOMEWHERE ELSE

	Sweet procession, rose-blue,
	and all them bells.
	Bandstand red, the eyes
	at treetop level seeing it.
	“Are we
	what we think we are or are we
	what befalls us?”
	The people from an open window
	the eyes
	seeing it!
	Daytime! Or twilight!
	If we’re here let’s be here now
	Sweet procession, rose-blue.
	If we’re here let’s be here now.
	And the train whistle? who
	invented that? Lonesome man, wanted the trains
	to speak for him.



27. SEPTEMBER 1961

	This is the year the old ones,
	the old great ones
	leave us alone on the road.
	
	The road leads to the sea.
	We have the words in our pockets,
	obscure directions. The old ones
	
	have taken away the light of their presence,
	we see it moving away over a hill
	off to one side.
	
	They are not dying,
	they are withdrawn
	into a painful privacy
	
	learning to live without words.
	E. P. “It looks like dying”--Williams: “I can’t
	describe to you what has been
	
	happening to me”--
	H. D. “unable to speak.”
	The darkness
	
	twists itself in the wind, the stars
	are small, the horizon
	ringed with confused urban light-haze.
	
	They have told us
	the road leads to the sea,
	and given
	
	the language into our hands.
	We hear
	our footsteps each time a truck
	
	has dazzled past us and gone
	leaving us new silence.
	One can’t reach
	
	the sea on this endless
	road to the sea unless
	one turns aside at the end, it seems,
	
	follows
	the owl that silently glides above it
	aslant, back and forth,
	
	and away into deep woods.
	
	But for usthe road
	unfurls itself, we count the
	words in our pockets, we wonder
	
	how it will be without them, we don’t
	stop walking, we know
	there is far to go, sometimes
	
	we think the night wind carries
	a smell of the sea . . .



28. STEPPING WESTWARD

	What is green in me
	darkens, muscadine.
	If woman is inconstant,
	good, I am faithful to
	ebb and flow, I fall
	in season and now
	is a time of ripening.
	If her part
	is to be true,
	a north star,
	good, I hold steady
	in the black sky
	and vanish by day,
	yet burn there
	in blue or above
	quilts of cloud.
	There is no savor
	more sweet, more salt
	than to be glad to be
	what, woman,
	and who, myself,
	I am, a shadow
	that grows longer as the sun
	moves, drawn out
	on a thread of wonder.
	If I bear burdens
	they begin to be remembered
	as gifts, goods, a basket
	of bread that hurts
	my shoulders but closes me
	in fragrance. I can
	eat as I go.



29. TALKING TO GRIEF

	Ah, Grief, I should not treat you
	like a homeless dog
	who comes to the back door
	for a crust, for a meatless bone.
	I should trust you.
	
	I should coax you
	into the house and give you
	your own corner,
	a worn mat to lie on,
	your own water dish.
	
	You think I don’t know you’ve been living
	under my porch.
	You long for your real place to be readied
	before winter comes. You need
	your name,
	your collar and tag. You need
	the right to warn off intruders,
	to consider
	my house your own
	and me your person
	and yourself
	my own dog.



30. ON THE MYSTERY OF THE INCARNATION

	It’s when we face for a moment
	the worst our kind can do, and shudder to know
	the taint in our own selves, that awe
	cracks the mind’s shell and enters the heart:
	not to a flower, not to a dolphin,
	to no innocent form
	but to this creature vainly sure
	it and no other is god-like, God
	(out of compassion for our ugly
	failure to evolve) entrusts,
	as guest, as brother,
	the Word.



31. TO LIVE IN THE MERCY OF GOD

	To lie back under the tallest
	oldest trees. How far the stems
	rise, rise
	              before ribs of shelter
	                                          open!
	
	To live in the mercy of God. The complete
	sentence too adequate, has no give.
	Awe, not comfort. Stone, elbows of
	stony wood beneath lenient
	moss bed.
	
	And awe suddenly
	passing beyond itself. Becomes
	a form of comfort.
	                     Becomes the steady
	air you glide on, arms
	stretched like the wings of flying foxes.
	To hear the multiple silence
	of trees, the rainy
	forest depths of their listening.
	
	To float, upheld,
	               as salt water
	               would hold you,
	                                       once you dared.
	        
	
	To live in the mercy of God.
	
	To feel vibrate the enraptured
	
	waterfall flinging itself
	unabating down and down
	                             to clenched fists of rock.
	Swiftness of plunge,
	hour after year after century,
	                                                  O or Ah
	uninterrupted, voice
	many-stranded.
	                             To breathe
	spray. The smoke of it.
	                             Arcs
	of steelwhite foam, glissades
	of fugitive jade barely perceptible. Such passion--
	rage or joy?
	                             Thus, not mild, not temperate,
	God’s love for the world. Vast
	flood of mercy
	                     flung on resistance.



32. A TREE TELLING OF ORPHEUS

	White dawn. Stillness. When the rippling began
	   I took it for a sea-wind, coming to our valley with rumors
	   of salt, of treeless horizons. but the white fog
	didn’t stir; the leaved of my brothers remained outstretched,
	unmoving.
	
	          Yet the rippling drew nearer--and then
	my own outermost branches began to tingle, almost as if
	fire had been lit below them, too close, and their twig-tips
	were drying and curling.
	                  Yet I was not afraid, only
	                  deeply alert.
	
	I was the first to see him, for I grew
	    out on the pasture slope, beyond the forest.
	He was a man, it seemed: the two
	moving stems, the short trunk, the two
	arm-branches, flexible, each with five leafless
	                              twigs at their ends,
	and the head that’s crowned by brown or gold grass,
	bearing a face not like the beaked face of a bird,
	   more like a flower’s.
	                     He carried a burden made of
	some cut branch bent while it was green,
	strands of a vine tight-stretched across it. From this,
	when he touched it, and from his voice
	which unlike the wind’s voice had no need of our
	leaves and branches to complete its sound,
	                        came the ripple.
	But it was now no longer a ripple (he had come near and
	stopped in my first shadow) it was a wave that bathed me
	    as if rain
	          rose from below and around me
	    instead of falling.
	And what I felt was no longer a dry tingling:
	    I seemed to be singing as he sang, I seemed to know
	    what the lark knows; all my sap
	          was mounting towards the sun that by now
	              had risen, the mist was rising, the grass
	was drying, yet my roots felt music moisten them
	deep under earth.
	
	        He came still closer, leaned on my trunk:
	          the bark thrilled like a leaf still-folded.
	Music! there was no twig of me not
	                        trembling with joy and fear.
	
	Then as he sang
	it was no longer sounds only that made the music:
	he spoke, and as no tree listens I listened, and language
	                    came into my roots
	                        out of the earth,
	                    into my bark
	                        out of the air,
	                    into the pores of my greenest shoots
	                        gently as dew
	and there was no word he sang but I knew its meaning.
	He told of journeys,
	          of where sun and moon go while we stand in dark,
	    of an earth-journey he dreamed he would take some day
	deeper than roots . . .
	He told of the dreams of man, wars, passions, griefs,
	              and I, a tree, understood words--ah, it seemed
	my thick bark would split like a sapling’s that
	                        grew too fast in the spring
	when a late frost wounds it.    
	    
	                          Fire he sang,
	that trees fear, and I, a tree, rejoiced in its flames.
	New buds broke forth from me though it was full summer.
	    As though his lyre (now I knew its name)
	    were both frost and fire, its chord flamed
	up to the crown of me.
	
	              I was seed again.
	                    I was fern in the swamp.
	                        I was coal.
	
	And at the heart of my wood
	(so close I was to becoming man or god)
	    there was a kind of silence, a kind of sickness,
	          something akin to what men call boredom,
	                                  something
	(the poem descended a scale, a stream over stones)
	          that gives to a candle a coldness
	              in the midst of its burning, he said.
	
	It was then,
	          when in the blaze of his power that
	                    reached me and changed me
	          I thought I should fall my length,
	that the singer began
	              to leave me.      Slowly
	          moved from my noon shadow
	                                  to open light,
	words leaping and dancing over his shoulders
	back to me
	          rivery sweep of lyre-tones becoming
	slowly again
	          ripple.
	
	And I              in terror
	                    but not in doubt of
	                                  what I must do
	in anguish, in haste,
	              wrenched from the earth root after root,
	the soil heaving and cracking, the moss tearing asunder--
	and behind me the others: my brothers
	forgotten since dawn. In the forest
	they too had heard,
	and were pulling their roots in pain
	out of a thousand year’s layers of dead leaves,
	    rolling the rocks away,
	                    breaking themselves
	                                      out of
	                                  their depths.    
	    
	  You would have thought we would lose the sound of the lyre,
	                    of the singing
	so dreadful the storm-sounds were, where there was no storm,
	              no wind but the rush of our
	          branches moving, our trunks breasting the air.
	                    But the music!
	                                The music reached us.
	Clumsily,
	    stumbling over our own roots,
	                            rustling our leaves
	                                        in answer,
	we moved, we followed.
	
	All day we followed, up hill and down.
	                              We learned to dance,
	for he would stop, where the ground was flat,
	                                  and words he said
	taught us to leap and to wind in and out
	around one another    in figures    the lyre’s measure designed.
	
	The singer
	          laughed till he wept to see us, he was so glad.
	                                        At sunset
	we came to this place I stand in, this knoll
	with its ancient grove that was bare grass then.
	          In the last light of that day his song became
	farewell.
	          He stilled our longing.
	          He sang our sun-dried roots back into earth,
	watered them: all-night rain of music so quiet
	                                        we could almost
	                              not hear it in the
	                                  moonless dark.
	By dawn he was gone.
	                    We have stood here since,
	in our new life.
	              We have waited.
	                        He does not return.
	It is said he made his earth-journey, and lost
	what he sought.
	              It is said they felled him
	and cut up his limbs for firewood.
	                                  And it is said
	his head still sang and was swept out to sea singing.
	Perhaps he will not return.
	                        But what we have lived
	comes back to us.
	              We see more.
	                        We feel, as our rings increase,
	something that lifts our branches, that stretches our furthest
	                                        leaf-tips
	further.
	    The wind, the birds,
	                        do not sound poorer but clearer,
	recalling our agony, and the way we danced.
	The music!



33. THE WELL

	At sixteen I believed the moonlight 
	could change me if it would.
	   I moved my head
	on the pillow, even moved my bed
	as the moon slowly
	crossed the open lattice.
	
	I wanted beauty, a dangerous
	gleam of steel, my body thinner,
	my pale face paler.
	   I moonbathed
	diligently, as others sunbathe.
	But the moon’s unsmiling stare
	kept me awake. Mornings,
	I was flushed and cross.
	
	It was on dark nights of deep sleep
	that I dreamed the most, sunk in the well,
	and woke rested, and if not beautiful,
	filled with some other power.



34. WHAT WERE THEY LIKE?

	Did the people of Viet Nam
	use lanterns of stone?
	Did they hold ceremonies
	to reverence the opening of buds?
	Were they inclined to quiet laughter?
	Did they use bone and ivory,
	jade and silver, for ornament?
	Had they an epic poem?
	Did they distinguish between speech and singing?
	
	Sir, their light hearts turned to stone.
	It is not remembered whether in gardens
	stone gardens illumined pleasant ways.
	Perhaps they gathered once to delight in blossom,
	but after their children were killed
	there were no more buds.
	Sir, laughter is bitter to the burned mouth.
	A dream ago, perhaps. Ornament is for joy.
	All the bones were charred.
	it is not remembered. Remember,
	most were peasants; their life
	was in rice and bamboo.
	When peaceful clouds were reflected in the paddies
	and the water buffalo stepped surely along terraces,
	maybe fathers told their sons old tales.
	When bombs smashed those mirrors
	there was time only to scream.
	There is an echo yet
	of their speech which was like a song.
	It was reported their singing resembled 
	the flight of moths in moonlight.
	Who can say? It is silent now.
