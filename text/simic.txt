*** Charles Simic (1938 - )


1. AGAINST WINTER

	The truth is dark under your eyelids.
	What are you going to do about it?
	The birds are silent; there’s no one to ask.
	All day long you’ll squint at the gray sky.
	When the wind blows you’ll shiver like straw.
	
	A meek little lamb you grew your wool
	Till they came after you with huge shears.
	Flies hovered over open mouth,
	Then they, too, flew off like the leaves,
	The bare branches reached after them in vain.
	
	Winter coming. Like the last heroic soldier
	Of a defeated army, you’ll stay at your post,
	Head bared to the first snow flake.
	Till a neighbor comes to yell at you,
	You’re crazier than the weather, Charlie.



2. ALL THESE MIRRORS

	And the one that’s got it in for you,
	Mister, that keeps taunting you
	In an old man’s morning wheeze
	Every time you so much as glance at it,
	Or blurt something in your defense,
	Loudly, sonorously raising your chin high
	While it spits and chokes in reply.
	The razor is at your throat.
	The lines are inscribing themselves
	On your forehead as you listen closely
	With a poultice of tissue paper
	Already reddening under your left eye.



3. AUTUMN SKY

	In my great grandmother’s time, 
	All one needed was a broom 
	To get to see places 
	And give the geese a chase in the sky. 
	
	The stars know everything, 
	So we try to read their minds. 
	As distant as they are, 
	We choose to whisper in their presence. 
	
	Oh Cynthia, 
	Take a clock that has lost its hands 
	For a ride. 
	Get me a room at Hotel Eternity 
	Where Time likes to stop now and then. 
	
	Come, lovers of dark corners, 
	The sky says, 
	And sit in one of my dark corners. 
	There are tasty little zeroes 
	In the peanut dish tonight.



4. BACK AT THE CHICKEN SHACK

	What I need is a seraph and a pig.
	The pig to eat and the seraph to ask questions.
	I suffer hugely. Of all matters heavenly,
	I’m suspicious, ornery, deeply mistrustful
	All I know is what Euclid says.
	
	We are strolling in our Sunday rags.
	We are tipping our hats to the Great Nothing,
	Snapping our fireman’s suspenders . . .
	When the ladies come into view
	In their light summer dresses, carrying parasols.
	It must be ten below zero.
	They seem to be laughing at us.
	One of them has fallen back and is praying.
	The sky is the color of pitch.
	Not even one star out tonight.
	
	I think the pig knows what’s in store for him,
	Your excellency. You ought to talk to him.
	He ought to talk to you.
	I assume you have an important message for all of us
	When vou come. In the meantime,
	The large butchering knife on the table
	And that woman praying in the galactic wind
	I sat and sat peering into the gloom,
	And then I remembered the mirrors,
	All the many kinds such a big city can contain,
	Dimming, dimming . . .
	Trying to catch one last glint of each other--
	And that calmed me down.



5. THE BATHER

	Where the path to the lake twists out of sight,
	A puff of dust, the kind bare feet make running,
	Is what I saw in the dying light,
	Night swooping down everywhere else.
	
	A low branch heavy with leaves
	Swaying momentarily where the shade
	Lay thickest, some late bather
	Disrobing right there for a quick dip--
	
	(Or my solitude playing a trick on me?)
	Pinned hair coming undone, soon to float
	As she turns on her back, letting
	The dozy current take her as it wishes
	
	Beyond the last drooping branch
	To where the sky opens
	Black as the water under her white arms,
	In the deepening night, deepening hush,
	
	The treetops like charred paper edges,
	Even the insects oddly reclusive
	While I strained to hear a splash,
	Or glimpse her running back to her clothes . . .
	
	And when I did not; I just sat there.
	The rare rush of wind in the leaves
	Still fooling me now and then,
	Until the chill made me go in.



6. THE BODY

	This last continent
	Still to be discovered.
	
	My hand is dreaming, is building
	Its ship. For crew it takes
	A pack of bones, for food
	A beer-bottle full of blood.
	
	It knows the breath that blows north
	With the breath from the west
	It will sail east each night.
	
	The scent of your body as it sleeps
	Are the land-birds sighted at sea.
	
	My touch is on the highest mast.
	It cries at four in the morning
	For a lantern to be lit
	On the rim of the world.



7. CHARON’S COSMOLOGY

	With only his dim lantern   
	To tell him where he is
	And every time a mountain   
	Of fresh corpses to load up
	
	Take them to the other side
	Where there are plenty more
	I’d say by now he must be confused   
	As to which side is which
	
	I’d say it doesn’t matter
	No one complains he’s got
	Their pockets to go through
	In one a crust of bread in another a sausage
	
	Once in a long while a mirror   
	Or a book which he throws   
	Overboard into the dark river   
	Swift and cold and deep



8. CLOUDS GATHERING

	It seemed the kind of life we wanted.
	Wild strawberries and cream in the morning.
	Sunlight in every room.
	The two of us walking by the sea naked.
	
	Some evenings, however, we found ourselves
	Unsure of what comes next.
	Like tragic actors in a theater on fire,
	With birds circling over our heads,
	The dark pines strangely still,
	Each rock we stepped on bloodied by the sunset.
	
	We were back on our terrace sipping wine.
	Why always this hint of an unhappy ending?
	Clouds of almost human appearance
	Gathering on the horizon, but the rest lovely
	With the air so mild and the sea untroubled.
	
	The night suddenly upon us, a starless night.
	You lighting a candle, carrying it naked
	Into our bedroom and blowing it out quickly.
	The dark pines and grasses strangely still.



9. COME WINTER

	The mad and homeless take shelter
	Against the cold weather
	In tombs of the fabulously rich,
	Where they huddle in their rags
	And make themselves scarce only
	
	When a hearse comes along
	Bringing the smell of freshly-cut roses
	And a drove of funkies
	With snow on their black shoulders
	In a hurry to lower the heavy coffin
	So it can go to hell on Satan’s luxury
	
	Train where they kick their shoes off,
	Gourmandize and sip wines
	Even God himself never gets to sip,
	As they pass the fires, the chilled crowds
	Of the damned lining the tracks,
	Straining to catch a glimpse of them.



10. CONCERNING MY NEIGHBORS, THE HITTITES

	Great are the Hittites.
	Their ears have mice and mice have holes.
	Their dogs bury themselves and leave the bones
	To guard the house. A single weed holds all their storms
	Until the spiderwebs spread over the heavens.
	There are bits of straw in their lakes and rivers
	Looking for drowned men. When a camel won’t pass
	Through the eye of one of their needles,
	They tie a house to its tail. Great are the Hittites.
	Their fathers are in cradles, their newborn make war.
	To them lead floats, a leaf sinks. Their god is the size
	Of a mustard seed so that he can be quickly eaten.
	
	They also piss against the wind,
	Pour water in a leaky bucket.
	Strike two tears to make fire,
	And have tongues with bones in them,
	Bones of a wolf gnawed by lambs.
	
	
	They are also called mound builders,
	They are called Asiatic horses
	That will drink on the Rhine, they are called
	My grandmother’s fortune-telling, they are called
	You can’t take it to the grave with you.
	
	It’s that hum in your left ear,
	A sigh coming from deep within you,
	A dream in which you keep falling forever,
	The hour in which you sit up in bed
	As though someone has shouted your name.
	
	No one knows why the Hittites exist,
	Still, when two are whispering
	One of them is listening.
	
	Did they catch the falling knife?
	They caught it like a fly with closed mouths.
	Did they balance the last egg?
	They struck the egg with a bone so it won’t howl.
	Did they wait for dead man’s shoes?
	The shoes went in at one ear and out the other.
	Did they wipe the blood from their mousetraps?
	They burnt the blood to warm themselves.
	Are they cold with no pockets in their shrouds?
	If the sky falls, they shall have clouds for supper.
	
	What do they have for us
	To put in our pipes and smoke?
	They have the braid of a beautiful girl
	That drew a team of cattle
	And the engraving of him who slept
	With dogs and rose with fleas
	Searching for its trace in the sky.
	
	
	And so there are fewer and fewer of them now.
	Who wrote their name on paper
	And burnt the paper? Who put snake bones
	In their pillows? Who threw nail parings
	In their soup? Who made them walk
	Under the ladder? Who stuck pins
	In their snapshots?
	
	The wart of warts and his brother evil eye.
	Bone-lazy and her sister rabbit’s-foot.
	Cross-your-fingers and their father dog star.
	Knock-on-wood and his mother hellfire.
	
	Because the tail can’t wag the cow.
	Because the woods can’t fly to the dove.
	Because the stones haven’t said their last word.
	Because dunghills rise and empires fall.
	
	
	They are leaving behind
	All the silver spoons
	Found inside their throats at birth,
	A hand they bit because it fed them,
	
	Two rats from a ship that is still sinking,
	A collection of various split hairs,
	The leaf they turned over too late.
	
	
	All that salt cast over the shoulder,
	All that bloody meat traveling under the saddles of nomads . . .
	
	Here comes a forest in wolf’s clothing,
	The wise hen bows to the umbrella.
	
	When the bloodshot evening meets the bloodshot night,
	They tell each other bloodshot tales.
	
	That bare branch over them speaks louder than words.
	The moon is worn threadbare.
	
	I repeat: lean days don’t come singly,
	It takes all kinds to make the sun rise.
	
	The night is each man’s castle.
	Don’t let the castle out of the bag.
	
	Wind in the valley, wind in the high hills,
	Practice will make this body fit this bed.
	
	
	May all roads lead
	Out of a sow’s ear
	To what’s worth
	Two in the bush.



11. EMPIRE OF DREAMS

	On the first page of my dreambook
	It’s always evening
	In an occupied country.
	Hour before the curfew.
	A small provincial city.
	The houses all dark.
	The storefronts gutted.
	
	I am on a street corner
	Where I shouldn’t be.
	Alone and coatless
	I have gone out to look
	For a black dog who answers to my whistle.
	I have a kind of Halloween mask
	Which I am afraid to put on.



12. EVENING WALK

	You give the appearance of listening
	To my thoughts, o trees,
	Bent over the road I am walking
	On a late summer evening
	When every one of you is a steep staircase
	The night is descending.
	
	The leaves like my mother’s lips
	Forever trembling, unable to decide,
	For there’s a bit of wind,
	And it’s like hearing voices,
	Or a mouth full of muffled laughter,
	A huge dark mouth we can all fit in
	Suddenly covered by a hand.
	
	Everything quiet. Light
	Of some other evening strolling ahead,
	Long-ago evening of long dresses,
	Pointy shoes, silver cigarette cases.
	Happy heart, what heavy steps you take
	As you hurry after them in the thickening shadows.
	
	The sky above still blue.
	The nightbirds like children
	Who won’t come to dinner.
	Lost children singing to themselves.



13. EYES FASTENED WITH PINS

	How much death works,
	No one knows what a long
	Day he puts in. The little
	Wife always alone
	Ironing death’s laundry.
	The beautiful daughters
	Setting death’s supper table.
	The neighbors playing
	Pinochle in the backyard
	Or just sitting on the steps
	Drinking beer. Death,
	Meanwhile, in a strange
	Part of town looking for
	Someone with a bad cough,
	But the address somehow wrong,
	Even death can’t figure it out
	Among all the locked doors . . .
	And the rain beginning to fall.
	Long windy night ahead.
	Death with not even a newspaper
	To cover his head, not even
	A dime to call the one pining away,
	Undressing slowly, sleepily,
	And stretching naked
	On death’s side of the bed.



14. THE FLIES

	Here are the baits, the hooks
	Are hidden. Pincushions,
	Is my suit ready?
	I recognize them. They were made
	Of dirt and spittle in an orphanage.
	How they sigh, then quickly cross themselves
	With their feet.
	I’m the cold window-pane of a house
	Abandoned for the Winter. They walk,
	Solemn, dipped in cigarette smoke,
	Like an angry word scratched in a public urinal.
	One of them will walk over my grave--
	Not this one I kill innocently
	Or that one, inert
	On the ear of my sleeping daughter.
	
	For a long time I’ve been trying
	To remember something. On my finger
	The fly glows like a ring. The wind,
	The first Winter one,
	High above the house
	In the redwood trees.
	
	A killed fly always comes back.
	Can one suddenly wake up inside one?
	We make flies as we think.
	Only Saints know the exact number.
	I hailed a big black one like a taxi,
	Today, as the night was falling.
	It took me to a room
	Where solitude keeps its saucer of milk.



15. FURNITURE MOVER

	Ah the great
	the venerable
	whoever he is
	
	ahead of me
	huge load
	terrific backache
	
	wherever
	a chair’s waiting
	meadow
	sky
	beckoning
	
	he’s the one
	that’s been
	there
	without instructions
	and for no wages
	
	a huge load
	on his back
	and under his arm
	thus
	always
	
	all in place
	perfect
	just as it was
	sweet home
	
	at the address
	I never even dreamed of
	the address
	I’m already changing
	
	in a hurry
	to overtake him
	to arrive
	not ahead
	
	but just as
	he sets down
	the table
	the bread crumbs
	
	I used to
	say
	I was part
	of his load
	
	high up there
	roped safely
	with the junk
	the eviction notices
	
	I used to
	prophesy
	he’ll stumble
	by and by
	
	no luck--
	oh
	Mr. Furniture Mover
	on my knees
	
	let me come
	for once
	early
	to where it’s vacant
	
	you still
	on the stairs
	wheezing
	between floors
	
	and me behind the door
	in the gloom
	I think I would
	let you do
	
	what you must



16. GREEN LAMPSHADE

	All the pages of all the books
	are blank.
	It’s a big secret.
	The readers say nothing about it
	to each other.
	
	On my block
	every house is a library.
	There are lights.
	Late into the night
	severe women
	enforce complete silence.
	
	I’ve been reading so much
	my eyes hurt.
	It’s a book on astronomy,
	or perhaps a book on the architecture
	of prisons.
	
	Across,
	the free thinker’s taking notes
	furiously.
	At the exit,
	my father’s checking out
	a little volume
	the size of a breviary.
	
	I know I’m much older than he.
	I have grey hairs,
	wear a shabby overcoat,
	will lick my forefinger
	before I turn
	the next page.



17. HENRY ROSSEAU’S BED

	I took my bed into the forest.
	How peaceful, I thought,
	when the full moon came out.
	The white stag nibbled my pillow,
	
	the nightbird sang in the hand
	of the huge hairy ape.
	It was not the bird of paradise.
	It was a gypsy with a mandolin.
	
	I had to run naked with my bed,
	knock at the prison gate,
	ask for their darkest solitary.
	They obliged, rats and all . . .
	
	The executioner’s lovely daughter
	coming to visit on tiptoes.
	Sad bread she brought, the world’s saddest.
	Her beauty bandaged my eyes.
	
	No small feat to get that bed
	out of there on insomnia’s bicycle.
	Like a worm crossing the Brooklyn Bridge,
	I found myself in a philosopher’s kitchen.
	
	It was cold and white as at the Pole.
	Snow kept falling into empty pots.
	I could have used a team of dogs
	to pull my bed, a queue of sleepwalkers . . .
	
	At the late movies where I found myself next,
	bedded under the screen,
	the great Egyptian-style theater empty,
	one could hear the wind between stars.
	
	In the picture, a lonely veiled woman
	clutched a handkerchief to her breast.
	Are you the gypsy, I shouted?
	And if so, where’s your mandolin?
	
	No, she replied. I’m the executioner’s lovely daughter.
	I’m on my way to the Galapagos Islands.
	I need tortoise glasses to look for my love
	who is asleep in the dark.



18. HOUSE

	My house has grown smaller
	It’s getting ready for a journey
	Its bristles are showing
	And its farmer’s boots.
	
	Already I hear a sack being dragged toward a river,
	Already I see a thin, barely visible track of flour.
	
	Strange,
	It must be the whiteness
	Of those immaculate beds
	Ground to powder,
	
	It must be the table
	From the kitchen
	Digging a hole in the earth
	To plant its knives.
	
	No answer . . . Prow of a sunken galleon.
	In its sailor’s heart the old house drinks to the wind.
	
	But then some men come and say:
	It is time to slaughter it.
	The winter is coming.
	Its meat needs to be dried in smoke.



19. I AM THE LAST NAPOLEONIC SOLDIER

	I am the last Napoleonic soldier. It’s almost two hundred years later and I am still retreating from Moscow. The road is lined with white birch trees and the mud comes up to my knees. The one-eyed woman wants to sell me a chicken, and I don’t even have any clothes on.      
	The Germans are going one way; I am going the other. The Russians are going still another way and waving good-by. I have a ceremonial saber. I use it to cut my hair, which is four feet long.



20. THE IMMORTAL

	You’re shivering my memory.
	You went out early and coatless
	To visit your old schoolmasters,
	The cruel schoolmasters
	And their pet monkeys.
	
	You took a wrong turn somewhere.
	You met an army of gray days,
	A ghost army of years on the march.
	It must have been the slop they ladled you,
	The ditch-water they made you drink.
	
	You found yourself again on that street,
	Inside that narrow room
	With a single dusty window.
	Outside it was snowing as in a dream
	You were ill and in bed.
	The whole world was absent at work.
	The blind old woman next door
	Whose sighs and shuffles you’d welcome
	Had died mysteriously in the summer.
	
	You had your own breath to listen to.
	You were perfectly alone and anonymous.
	It would have taken months for anyone
	To begin to miss you. The chill
	Made you pull the covers up to the chin.
	
	You remembered the lost arctic voyagers,
	The snow erasing their footprints.
	You had no money and no prospects in sight.
	Both of your lungs were hurting.
	You had no intention of lifting a finger
	To help yourself. You were immortal.
	
	Outside the same darkening snowflake
	Seemed to be falling over and over again.
	You studied the cracked walls,
	The many water-stains on the ceiling
	Trying to fix in your mind each detail.
	
	Time had stopped at dusk.
	You were shivering at the thought
	Of such great happiness.



21. THE INITIATE

	St. John of the Cross wore dark glasses
	As he passed me on the street.
	St. Theresa of Avila, beautiful and grave,
	Turned her back on me.
	
	“Soulmate,“ they hissed. “It’s high time.”
	
	I was a blind child, a wind-up toy . . .
	I was one of death’s juggling red balls
	On a certain street corner
	Where they peddle things out of suitcases.
	
	The city like a huge cinema
	With lights dimmed.
	The performance already started.
	
	So many blurred faces in a complicated plot.
	
	The great secret which kept eluding me: knowing who I am . . .
	
	The Redeemer and the Virgin,
	Their eyes wide open in the empty church
	Where the killer came to hide himself . . .
	
	The new snow on the sidewalk bore footprints
	That could have been made by bare feet.
	Some unknown penitent guiding me.
	In truth, I didn’t know where I was going.
	My feet were frozen,
	My stomach growled.
	
	Four young hoods blocking my way.
	Three deadpan, one smiling crazily.
	
	I let them have my black raincoat.
	
	Thinking constantly of the Divine Love
	and the Absolute had disfigured me.
	People mistook me for someone else.
	I heard voices after me calling out unknown names.
	“I’m searching for someone to sell my soul to,”
	The drunk who followed me whispered,
	While appraising me from head to foot.
	
	At the address I had been given.
	The building had large X’s over its windows.
	I knocked but no one came to open.
	By and by a black girl joined me on the steps.
	She banged at the door till her fist hurt.
	
	Her name was Alma, a propitious sign.
	She knew someone who solved life’s riddles
	In a voice of an ancient Sumerian queen.
	We had a long talk about that
	While shivering and stamping our wet feet.
	
	It was necessary to stay calm, I explained,
	Even with the earth trembling,
	And to continue to watch oneself
	As if one were a complete stranger.
	
	Once in Chicago, for instance,
	I caught sight of a man in a shaving mirror
	Who had my naked shoulders and face,
	But whose eyes terrified me!
	Two hard staring, all-knowing eyes!
	
	After we parted, the night, the cold, and the endless walking
	Brought on a kind of ecstasy.
	I went as if pursued, trying to warm myself.
	
	There was the East River; there was the Hudson.
	Their waters shone like oil in sanctuary lamps.
	
	Something supreme was occurring
	For which there will never be any words.
	
	The sky was full of racing clouds and tall buildings,
	Whirling and whirling silently.
	
	In that whole city you could hear a pin drop.
	Believe me.
	I thought I heard a pin drop and I went looking for it.



22. INNER MAN

	It isn’t the body
	That’s a stranger.
	It’s someone else.
	
	We poke the same
	Ugly mug
	At the world.
	When I scratch
	He scratches too.
	
	There are women
	Who claim to have held him.
	A dog
	Follows me about.
	It might be his.
	
	If I’m quiet, he’s quieter.
	So I forget him.
	Yet, as I bend down
	To tie my shoelaces,
	He’s standing up.
	
	We caste a single shadow.
	Whose shadow?
	
	I’d like to say:
	“He was un the beginning
	And he’ll be in the end,”
	But one can’t be sure.
	
	At night
	As I sit
	Shuffling the cards of our silence,
	I say to him:
	
	“Though you utter
	Every one of my words,
	You are a stranger.
	It’s time you spoke.”



23. NANCY JANE

	Grandma laughing on her deathbed.
	Eternity, the quiet one, listening in.
	
	Like moths around an oil lamp we were.
	Like ragdolls tucked away in the attic.
	
	In walked a cat with a mouthful of feathers.
	(How about that?)
	
	A dark little country store full of gravedigger’s children buying candy. 
	(That’s how we looked that night.) 
	
	The young men pumping gas spoke of his friends: the clouds.
	It was such a sad story, it made everyone laugh.
	
	A bird called out of a tree, but received no answer.
	
	The beauty of that last moment
	Like a red sail on the bay at sunset,
	
	Or like a wheel breaking off a car
	And roaming the world on its own.



24. OLD COUPLE

	They’re waiting to be murdered,
	Or evicted. Soon
	They expect to have nothing to eat.
	In the meantime, they sit.
	
	A violent pain is coming, they think.
	It will start in the heart
	And climb into the mouth.
	They’ll be carried off in stretchers, howling.
	
	Tonight they watch the window
	Without exchanging a word.
	It has rained, and now it looks
	Like it’s going to snow a little.
	
	I see him get up to lower the shades.
	If their window stays dark,
	I know his hand has reached hers
	Just as she was about to turn on the lights.



25. THE PILLOW

	Are we still travelling?
	Whiteness, you come out of a dog’s mouth
	On a cold day. Apron,
	I lie within you like an apple.
	
	You’ve lit up the forest. Two
	Black winds you sell. Do you still
	Guard me from thieves
	On the road fearsome and lonesome?
	
	To tie my breath inside you
	Into a knot--find the way
	Back to your old scent.
	It still hasn’t bought me a mocking bird.
	
	We separated, sacred time.
	I stretch between two chairs. Recently,
	I started wearing blinders. One-legged,
	Since there’s no room for the other.
	
	The dead love eggs. This is
	That pebble tucked beneath you
	Speaking. Bared now,
	For those who grind their teeth in sleep
	
	To lay down their heads.



26. PRODIGY

	I grew up bent over   
	a chessboard.
	
	I loved the word _endgame_.
	
	All my cousins looked worried.
	
	It was a small house
	near a Roman graveyard.   
	Planes and tanks
	shook its windowpanes.
	
	A retired professor of astronomy   
	taught me how to play.
	
	That must have been in 1944.
	
	In the set we were using,
	the paint had almost chipped off   
	the black pieces.
	
	The white King was missing   
	and had to be substituted for.
	
	I’m told but do not believe   
	that that summer I witnessed   
	men hung from telephone poles.
	
	I remember my mother   
	blindfolding me a lot.
	She had a way of tucking my head   
	suddenly under her overcoat.
	
	In chess, too, the professor told me,   
	the masters play blindfolded,   
	the great ones on several boards   
	at the same time.



27. THE PROMPTER

	The one who had been whispering
	All along in this empty theater
	And whose voice I just heard--
	Or imagined I did
	Distracted as I was by my own thoughts.
	
	_God have mercy on my poor soul_
	Was to be my line,
	Which I couldn’t bring myself to say
	With the shivers going up my spine
	Like white mice.
	
	And when I finally did get around to,
	There was no response,
	A clap, someone chuckling briefly
	Is all I had hoped for
	And not this great sweep of nothing.



28. PUPPET-MAKER

	In his fear of solitude, he made us.   
	Fearing eternity, he gave us time. 
	I hear his white cane thumping 
	Up and down the hall. 
	
	I expect neighbors to complain, but no. 
	The little girl who sobbed 
	When her daddy crawled into her bed 
	Is quiet now.   
	
	It’s quarter to two. 
	On this street of darkened pawnshops, 
	Welfare hotels and tenements, 
	One or two ragged puppets are awake.



29. THE STRAY

	One day, chasing my tail here and there,
	I stopped to catch my breath
	On some corner in New York,
	While people hurried past me,
	All determined to get somewhere,
	Save a few adrift like lost children.
	
	What ever became of my youth?
	I wanted to stop a stranger and ask.
	“It went into hiding,” said an old woman
	Who’d read my mind.
	“Swimming with sharks,” a drunk concurred,
	Fixing me with one bloody eye.
	
	It was summer, and then as quietly as  a bird lands,
	The sidewalks were dusted with snow
	And I was shivering without a coat.
	I had hopes we’d meet again, I told myself,
	Have a drink and recall the nights
	When we used to paint this town red.
	
	I thought you’d be in a straightjacket by now,
	You’d say to me,
	Making funny faces at doctors and nurses.
	Instead, here you are full of fleas,
	Dodging cars and buses
	To follow a pair of good-looking legs home.
	
	“And you, Judas,” I summed the strength to shout,
	“Will you be coming to my funeral?”
	But he was gone already. It had gotten late in the day,
	Very late--and since there was nothing
	That could be done about it--
	I thought I’d better toddle along myself.



30. SUFFERING

	Shall I sell it door to door?
	Dirt under my fingernails.
	Ear-bones out of home-made brandy.
	Spider nests from my liver.
	
	It’s just beginning, this hump
	That makes me take a step
	Differently. Something bristly, growing
	In its hiding place, evicting me
	With a raised shovel.
	
	Naturally I tried to argue, to convince . . .
	Then on the sly, stuff it in a sack
	Full of rocks and drop it in a river.
	It waited with open arms on my return.
	
	We made love. Later, I shared
	A can of sardines with it and a cup of milk
	It’s getting fat with drool off my spoon,
	With spittle I aim at its face.
	
	Now I breathe only its breath
	Of dirty diapers, of lint
	That lines the pockets, of sweat.
	
	If I’m still awake, it’s because
	It needs this light to read by
	The Lives of its Saints:
	How an old Polish woman
	Saw God as she scrubbed floors.



31. TAPESTRY

	It hangs from heaven to earth.
	There are trees in it, cities, rivers,   
	small pigs and moons. In one corner
	the snow falling over a charging cavalry,   
	in another women are planting rice.
	
	You can also see:
	a chicken carried off by a fox,
	a naked couple on their wedding night,
	a column of smoke,
	an evil-eyed woman spitting into a pail of milk.
	
	What is behind it?
	--Space, plenty of empty space.
	
	And who is talking now?
	--A man asleep under his hat.
	
	What happens when he wakes up?
	--He’ll go into a barbershop.
	They’ll shave his beard, nose, ears, and hair,   
	To make him look like everyone else.



32. THIS MORNING

	Enter without knocking, hard-working ant.
	I’m just sitting here mulling over
	What to do this dark, overcast day?
	It was a night of the radio turned down low,
	Fitful sleep, vague, troubling dreams.
	I woke up lovesick and confused.
	I thought I heard Estella in the garden singing
	And some bird answering her,
	But it was the rain. Dark tree tops swaying
	And whispering. “Come to me my desire,”
	I said. And she came to me by and by,
	Her breath smelling of mint, her tongue
	Wetting my cheek, and then she vanished.
	Slowly day came, a gray streak of daylight
	To bathe my hands and face in.
	Hours passed, and then you crawled
	Under the door, and stopped before me.
	You visit the same tailors the mourners do,
	Mr. Ant. I like the silence between us,
	The quiet--that holy state even the rain
	Knows about. Listen to her begin to fall,
	As if with eyes closed,
	Muting each drop in her wild-beating heart.



33. THE WHITE ROOM

	The obvious is difficult
	To prove. Many prefer
	The hidden. I did, too.
	I listened to the trees.
	
	They had a secret
	Which they were about to
	Make known to me,
	And then didn’t.
	
	Summer came. Each tree
	On my street had its own
	Scheherazade. My nights
	Were a part of their wild
	
	Storytelling. We were
	Entering dark houses,
	More and more dark houses
	Hushed and abandoned.
	
	There was someone with eyes closed
	On the upper floors.
	The thought of it, and the wonder,
	Kept me sleepless.
	
	The truth is bald and cold,
	Said the woman
	Who always wore white.
	She didn’t leave her room much.
	
	The sun pointed to one or two
	Things that had survived
	The long night intact,
	The simplest things,
	
	Difficult in their obviousness.
	They made no noise.
	It was the kind of day
	People describe as “perfect.”
	
	Gods disguising themselves
	As black hairpins? A hand-mirror?
	A comb with a tooth missing?
	No! That wasn’t it.
	
	Just things as they are,
	Unblinking, lying mute
	In that bright light,
	And the trees waiting for the night.
