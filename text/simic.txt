*** Charles Simic (1938 - )


1. AGAINST WINTER

	The truth is dark under your eyelids.
	What are you going to do about it?
	The birds are silent; there’s no one to ask.
	All day long you’ll squint at the gray sky.
	When the wind blows you’ll shiver like straw.
	
	A meek little lamb you grew your wool
	Till they came after you with huge shears.
	Flies hovered over open mouth,
	Then they, too, flew off like the leaves,
	The bare branches reached after them in vain.
	
	Winter coming. Like the last heroic soldier
	Of a defeated army, you’ll stay at your post,
	Head bared to the first snow flake.
	Till a neighbor comes to yell at you,
	You’re crazier than the weather, Charlie.



2. THE BATHER

	Where the path to the lake twists out of sight,
	A puff of dust, the kind bare feet make running,
	Is what I saw in the dying light,
	Night swooping down everywhere else.
	
	A low branch heavy with leaves
	Swaying momentarily where the shade
	Lay thickest, some late bather
	Disrobing right there for a quick dip--
	
	(Or my solitude playing a trick on me?)
	Pinned hair coming undone, soon to float
	As she turns on her back, letting
	The dozy current take her as it wishes
	
	Beyond the last drooping branch
	To where the sky opens
	Black as the water under her white arms,
	In the deepening night, deepening hush,
	
	The treetops like charred paper edges,
	Even the insects oddly reclusive
	While I strained to hear a splash,
	Or glimpse her running back to her clothes . . .
	
	And when I did not; I just sat there.
	The rare rush of wind in the leaves
	Still fooling me now and then,
	Until the chill made me go in.



3. CLOUDS GATHERING

	It seemed the kind of life we wanted.
	Wild strawberries and cream in the morning.
	Sunlight in every room.
	The two of us walking by the sea naked.
	
	Some evenings, however, we found ourselves
	Unsure of what comes next.
	Like tragic actors in a theater on fire,
	With birds circling over our heads,
	The dark pines strangely still,
	Each rock we stepped on bloodied by the sunset.
	
	We were back on our terrace sipping wine.
	Why always this hint of an unhappy ending?
	Clouds of almost human appearance
	Gathering on the horizon, but the rest lovely
	With the air so mild and the sea untroubled.
	
	The night suddenly upon us, a starless night.
	You lighting a candle, carrying it naked
	Into our bedroom and blowing it out quickly.
	The dark pines and grasses strangely still.



4. EYES FASTENED WITH PINS

	How much death works,
	No one knows what a long
	Day he puts in. The little
	Wife always alone
	Ironing death’s laundry.
	The beautiful daughters
	Setting death’s supper table.
	The neighbors playing
	Pinochle in the backyard
	Or just sitting on the steps
	Drinking beer. Death,
	Meanwhile, in a strange
	Part of town looking for
	Someone with a bad cough,
	But the address somehow wrong,
	Even death can’t figure it out
	Among all the locked doors . . .
	And the rain beginning to fall.
	Long windy night ahead.
	Death with not even a newspaper
	To cover his head, not even
	A dime to call the one pining away,
	Undressing slowly, sleepily,
	And stretching naked
	On death’s side of the bed.



5. THE INITIATE

	St. John of the Cross wore dark glasses
	As he passed me on the street.
	St. Theresa of Avila, beautiful and grave,
	Turned her back on me.
	
	“Soulmate,“ they hissed. “It’s high time.”
	
	I was a blind child, a wind-up toy . . .
	I was one of death’s juggling red balls
	On a certain street corner
	Where they peddle things out of suitcases.
	
	The city like a huge cinema
	With lights dimmed.
	The performance already started.
	
	So many blurred faces in a complicated plot.
	
	The great secret which kept eluding me: knowing who I am . . .
	
	The Redeemer and the Virgin,
	Their eyes wide open in the empty church
	Where the killer came to hide himself . . .
	
	The new snow on the sidewalk bore footprints
	That could have been made by bare feet.
	Some unknown penitent guiding me.
	In truth, I didn’t know where I was going.
	My feet were frozen,
	My stomach growled.
	
	Four young hoods blocking my way.
	Three deadpan, one smiling crazily.
	
	I let them have my black raincoat.
	
	Thinking constantly of the Divine Love
	and the Absolute had disfigured me.
	People mistook me for someone else.
	I heard voices after me calling out unknown names.
	“I’m searching for someone to sell my soul to,”
	The drunk who followed me whispered,
	While appraising me from head to foot.
	
	At the address I had been given.
	The building had large X’s over its windows.
	I knocked but no one came to open.
	By and by a black girl joined me on the steps.
	She banged at the door till her fist hurt.
	
	Her name was Alma, a propitious sign.
	She knew someone who solved life’s riddles
	In a voice of an ancient Sumerian queen.
	We had a long talk about that
	While shivering and stamping our wet feet.
	
	It was necessary to stay calm, I explained,
	Even with the earth trembling,
	And to continue to watch oneself
	As if one were a complete stranger.
	
	Once in Chicago, for instance,
	I caught sight of a man in a shaving mirror
	Who had my naked shoulders and face,
	But whose eyes terrified me!
	Two hard staring, all-knowing eyes!
	
	After we parted, the night, the cold, and the endless walking
	Brought on a kind of ecstasy.
	I went as if pursued, trying to warm myself.
	
	There was the East River; there was the Hudson.
	Their waters shone like oil in sanctuary lamps.
	
	Something supreme was occurring
	For which there will never be any words.
	
	The sky was full of racing clouds and tall buildings,
	Whirling and whirling silently.
	
	In that whole city you could hear a pin drop.
	Believe me.
	I thought I heard a pin drop and I went looking for it.



6. INNER MAN

	It isn’t the body
	That’s a stranger.
	It’s someone else.
	
	We poke the same
	Ugly mug
	At the world.
	When I scratch
	He scratches too.
	
	There are women
	Who claim to have held him.
	A dog
	Follows me about.
	It might be his.
	
	If I’m quiet, he’s quieter.
	So I forget him.
	Yet, as I bend down
	To tie my shoelaces,
	He’s standing up.
	
	We caste a single shadow.
	Whose shadow?
	
	I’d like to say:
	“He was un the beginning
	And he’ll be in the end,”
	But one can’t be sure.
	
	At night
	As I sit
	Shuffling the cards of our silence,
	I say to him:
	
	“Though you utter
	Every one of my words,
	You are a stranger.
	It’s time you spoke.”



7. THIS MORNING

	Enter without knocking, hard-working ant.
	I’m just sitting here mulling over
	What to do this dark, overcast day?
	It was a night of the radio turned down low,
	Fitful sleep, vague, troubling dreams.
	I woke up lovesick and confused.
	I thought I heard Estella in the garden singing
	And some bird answering her,
	But it was the rain. Dark tree tops swaying
	And whispering. “Come to me my desire,”
	I said. And she came to me by and by,
	Her breath smelling of mint, her tongue
	Wetting my cheek, and then she vanished.
	Slowly day came, a gray streak of daylight
	To bathe my hands and face in.
	Hours passed, and then you crawled
	Under the door, and stopped before me.
	You visit the same tailors the mourners do,
	Mr. Ant. I like the silence between us,
	The quiet--that holy state even the rain
	Knows about. Listen to her begin to fall,
	As if with eyes closed,
	Muting each drop in her wild-beating heart.
