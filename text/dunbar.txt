*** Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872 - 1906)


1. CHRISTMAS CAROL

	    Ring out, ye bells!
	   All Nature swells
	With gladness at the wondrous story,--
	   The world was lorn,
	   But Christ is born
	To change our sadness into glory.
	
	   Sing, earthlings, sing!
	   To-night a King
	Hath come from heaven’s high throne to bless us.
	   The outstretched hand
	   O’er all the land
	Is raised in pity to caress us.
	
	   Come at his call;
	   Be joyful all;
	Away with mourning and with sadness!
	   The heavenly choir
	   With holy fire
	Their voices raise in songs of gladness.
	
	   The darkness breaks
	   And Dawn awakes,
	Her cheeks suffused with youthful blushes.
	   The rocks and stones
	   In holy tones
	Are singing sweeter than the thrushes.
	
	   Then why should we
	   In silence be,
	When Nature lends her voice to praises;
	   When heaven and earth
	   Proclaim the truth
	Of Him for whom that lone star blazes?
	
	   No, be not still,
	   But with a will
	Strike all your harps and set them ringing;
	   On hill and heath
	   Let every breath
	Throw all its power into singing!



2. EMANCIPATION

	Fling out your banners, your honors be bringing,
	Raise to the ether your paeans of praise.
	Strike every chord and let music be ringing!
	Celebrate freely this day of all days.
	
	Few are the years since that notable blessing,
	Raised you from slaves to the powers of men.
	Each year has seen you my brothers progressing,
	Never to sink to that level again.
	
	Perched on your shoulders sits Liberty smiling,
	Perched where the eyes of the nations can see.
	Keep from her pinions all contact defiling;
	Show by your deeds what you’re destined to be.
	
	Press boldly forward nor waver, nor falter.
	Blood has been freely poured out in your cause,
	Lives sacrificed upon Liberty’s alter.
	Press to the front, it were craven to pause.
	
	Look to the heights that are worth your attaining
	Keep your feet firm in the path to the goal.
	Toward noble deeds every effort be straining.
	Worthy ambition is food for the soul!
	
	Up! Men and brothers, be noble, be earnest!
	Ripe is the time and success is assured;
	Know that your fate was the hardest and sternest
	When through those lash-ringing days you endured.
	
	Never again shall the manacles gall you
	Never again shall the whip stroke defame!
	Nobles and Freemen, your destinies call you
	Onward to honor, to glory and fame.



3. THE FARM HOUSE BY THE RIVER

	I know a little country place
	Where still my heart doth linger,
	And o’er its fields is every grace
	Lined out by memory’s finger.
	Back from the lane where poplar grew
	And aspens quake and quiver,
	There stands all bath’d in summer’s glow
	A farm house by the river.
	
	Its eaves are touched with golden light
	So sweetly, softly shining,
	And morning-glories full and bright
	About the doors are twining.
	And there endowed with every grace
	That nature’s hand could give her,
	There lived the angel of the place
	In the farm house by the river.
	
	Her eyes were blue, her hair was gold,
	Her face was bright and sunny;
	The songs that from her bosom rolled
	Were sweet as summer’s honey.
	And I loved her well, that maid divine,
	And I prayed the Gracious Giver,
	That I some day might call her mine
	In the farm house by the river.
	
	‘Twas not to be--but God knows best,
	His will for aye be heed!
	Perhaps amid the angels blest,
	My little love was needed.
	Her spirit from its thralldom torn
	Went singing o’er the river,
	And that sweet life my heart shall mourn
	Forever and forever.
	
	She died one morn at early light
	When all the birds are singing,
	And heaven itself in pure delight
	Its bells of joy seemed ringing.
	They laid her dust where soon and late
	The solemn grasses quiver,
	And left alone and disolate
	The farm house by the river.



4. THE OLD APPLE TREE

	THERE’s a memory keeps a-runnin’
	Through my weary head to-night,
	An’ I see a picture dancin’
	In the fire-flames’ ruddy-light;
	‘Tis the picture of an orchard
	Wrapped in autumn’s purple haze,
	With the tender light about it
	That I loved in other days.
	An’ a-standin’ in a corner
	Once again I seem to see
	The verdant leaves an’ branches
	Of an old apple-tree.
	You perhaps would call it ugly,
	An’ I don’t know but it’s so,
	When you look the tree all over
	Unadorned by memory’s glow;
	For its boughs are gnarled an’ crooked,
	An’ its leaves are gettin’ thin,
	An’ the apples of its bearin’
	Wouldn’t fill so large a bin
	As they used to. But I tell you,
	When it comes to pleasin’ me,
	It’s the dearest in the orchard,--
	Is that old apple-tree.
	I would hide within its shelter,
	Settlin’ in some cosy nook,
	Where no calls nor threats could stir me
	From the pages o’ my book.
	Oh, that quiet, sweet seclusion
	In its fulness passeth words!
	It was deeper than the deepest
	That my sanctum now affords.
	Why, the jaybirds an’ the robins,
	They was hand in glove with me,
	As they winked at me ‘an warbled
	In that old apple-tree.
	It was on its sturdy branches
	That in summers long ago
	I would tie my swing an’ dangle
	In contentment to an’ fro,
	Idly dreaming’ childish fancies,
	Buildin’ castles in the air,
	Makin’ o’ myself a hero
	Of romances rich an’ rare.
	I kin shet my eyes an’ see it
	Jest as plain as plain kin be,
	That same old swing a-danglin’
	To the old apple-tree.
	There’s a rustic seat beneath it
	That I never kin forget.
	It’s the place where me an’ Hallie--
	Little sweetheart--used to set,
	When we’d wander to the orchard
	So’s no listenin’ ones could hear
	As I whispered sugared nonsense
	Into her little willin’ ear.
	Now my gray old wife is Hallie,
	An’ I’m grayer still than she,
	But I’ll not forget our courtin’
	‘Neath the old apple-tree,
	Life for us ain’t all been summer,
	But I guess we’ve had our share
	Of its flittin’ joys an’ pleasures,
	An’ a sprinklin’ of its care.
	Oft the skies have smiled upon us;
	Then again we’ve seen ‘em frown,
	Though our load was ne’er so heavy
	That we longed to lay it down.
	But when death does come a-callin’,
	This my last request shall be,--
	That they’ll bury me an’ Hallie
	‘Neath the old apple-tree.



5. SYMPATHY

	I know what the caged bird feels, alas!
	When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;
	When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,
	And the river flows like a stream of glass;
	When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,
	And the faint perfume from its chalice steals--
	I know what the caged bird feels!
	
	I know why the caged bird beats his wing
	Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;
	For he must fly back to his perch and cling
	When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
	And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars
	And they pulse again with a keener sting--
	I know why he beats his wing!
	
	I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
	When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--
	When he beats his bars and he would be free;
	It is not a carol of joy or glee,
	But a prayer that he sends from his heart’s deep core,
	But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--
	I know why the caged bird sings!
