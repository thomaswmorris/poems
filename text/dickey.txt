*** James Dickey (1923 - 1997)


1. CHERRYLOG ROAD

	Off Highway 106
	At Cherrylog Road I entered   
	The ’34 Ford without wheels,   
	Smothered in kudzu,
	With a seat pulled out to run
	Corn whiskey down from the hills,
	
	And then from the other side   
	Crept into an Essex
	With a rumble seat of red leather   
	And then out again, aboard   
	A blue Chevrolet, releasing   
	The rust from its other color,
	
	Reared up on three building blocks.   
	None had the same body heat;
	I changed with them inward, toward   
	The weedy heart of the junkyard,   
	For I knew that Doris Holbrook   
	Would escape from her father at noon
	
	And would come from the farm   
	To seek parts owned by the sun   
	Among the abandoned chassis,   
	Sitting in each in turn
	As I did, leaning forward
	As in a wild stock-car race
	
	In the parking lot of the dead.   
	Time after time, I climbed in   
	And out the other side, like   
	An envoy or movie star
	Met at the station by crickets.   
	A radiator cap raised its head,
	
	Become a real toad or a kingsnake   
	As I neared the hub of the yard,   
	Passing through many states,   
	Many lives, to reach
	Some grandmother’s long Pierce-Arrow   
	Sending platters of blindness forth
	
	From its nickel hubcaps
	And spilling its tender upholstery
	On sleepy roaches,
	The glass panel in between   
	Lady and colored driver   
	Not all the way broken out,
	
	The back-seat phone
	Still on its hook.
	I got in as though to exclaim,   
	“Let us go to the orphan asylum,   
	John; I have some old toys
	For children who say their prayers.”
	
	I popped with sweat as I thought   
	I heard Doris Holbrook scrape
	Like a mouse in the southern-state sun   
	That was eating the paint in blisters   
	From a hundred car tops and hoods.   
	She was tapping like code,
	
	Loosening the screws,   
	Carrying off headlights,   
	Sparkplugs, bumpers,
	Cracked mirrors and gear-knobs,   
	Getting ready, already,
	To go back with something to show
	
	Other than her lips’ new trembling   
	I would hold to me soon, soon,   
	Where I sat in the ripped back seat
	Talking over the interphone,   
	Praying for Doris Holbrook   
	To come from her father’s farm
	
	And to get back there
	With no trace of me on her face
	To be seen by her red-haired father
	Who would change, in the squalling barn,   
	Her back’s pale skin with a strop,
	Then lay for me
	
	In a bootlegger’s roasting car
	With a string-triggered I2-gauge shotgun   
	To blast the breath from the air.
	Not cut by the jagged windshields,   
	Through the acres of wrecks she came   
	With a wrench in her hand,
	
	Through dust where the blacksnake dies   
	Of boredom, and the beetle knows   
	The compost has no more life.
	Someone outside would have seen   
	The oldest car’s door inexplicably   
	Close from within:
	
	I held her and held her and held her,   
	Convoyed at terrific speed
	By the stalled, dreaming traffic around us,   
	So the blacksnake, stiff
	With inaction, curved back
	Into life, and hunted the mouse
	
	With deadly overexcitement,   
	The beetles reclaimed their field   
	As we clung, glued together,
	With the hooks of the seat springs   
	Working through to catch us red-handed   
	Amidst the gray breathless batting
	
	That burst from the seat at our backs.   
	We left by separate doors
	Into the changed, other bodies
	Of cars, she down Cherrylog Road   
	And I to my motorcycle
	Parked like the soul of the junkyard
	
	Restored, a bicycle fleshed
	With power, and tore off
	Up Highway 106, continually   
	Drunk on the wind in my mouth,   
	Wringing the handlebar for speed,   
	Wild to be wreckage forever.



2. FALLING

		_A 29-year-old stewardess fell . . . to her
		death tonight when she was swept
		through an emergency door that sud-
		denly sprang open . . . The body . . .
		was found . . . three hours after the
		accident._                                             
	                             --New York Times
	
	The states when they black out and lie there rolling    when they turn
	To something transcontinental    move by    drawing moonlight out of the great
	One-sided stone hung off the starboard wingtip    some sleeper next to
	An engine is groaning for coffee    and there is faintly coming in
	Somewhere the vast beast-whistle of space. In the galley with its racks
	Of trays    she rummages for a blanket    and moves in her slim tailored
	Uniform to pin it over the cry at the top of the door. As though she blew
	
	The door down with a silent blast from her lungs    frozen    she is black
	Out finding herself    with the plane nowhere and her body taken by the throat
	The undying cry of the void    falling    living    beginning to be something
	That no one has ever been and lived through    screaming without enough air
	Still neat    lipsticked    stockinged    girdled by regulation    her hat
	Still on    her arms and legs in no world    and yet spaced also strangely
	With utter placid rightness on thin air    taking her time    she holds it
	In many places    and now, still thousands of feet from her death she seems
	To slow    she develops interest    she turns in her maneuverable body
	
	To watch it. She is hung high up in the overwhelming middle of things in her
	Self    in low body-whistling wrapped intensely    in all her dark dance-weight
	Coming down from a marvellous leap    with the delaying, dumfounding ease
	Of a dream of being drawn    like endless moonlight to the harvest soil
	Of a central state of one’s country    with a great gradual warmth coming
	Over her    floating    finding more and more breath in what she has been using
	For breath    as the levels become more human    seeing clouds placed honestly
	Below her left and right    riding slowly toward them    she clasps it all
	To her and can hang her hands and feet in it in peculiar ways    and
	Her eyes opened wide by wind, can open her mouth as wide    wider and suck
	All the heat from the cornfields    can go down on her back with a feeling
	Of stupendous pillows stacked under her    and can turn    turn as to someone
	In bed    smile, understood in darkness    can go away    slant    slide
	Off tumbling    into the emblem of a bird with its wings half-spread
	Or whirl madly on herself    in endless gymnastics in the growing warmth
	Of wheatfields rising toward the harvest moon.    There is time to live
	In superhuman health    seeing mortal unreachable lights far down seeing
	An ultimate highway with one late priceless car probing it    arriving
	In a square town    and off her starboard arm the glitter of water catches
	The moon by its one shaken side    scaled, roaming silver    My God it is good
	And evil    lying in one after another of all the positions for love
	Making    dancing    sleeping    and now cloud wisps at her no
	Raincoat    no matter    all small towns brokenly brighter from inside
	Cloud    she walks over them like rain    bursts out to behold a Greyhound
	Bus shooting light through its sides    it is the signal to go straight
	Down like a glorious diver    then feet first    her skirt stripped beautifully
	Up    her face in fear-scented cloths    her legs deliriously bare    then
	Arms out    she slow-rolls over    steadies out    waits for something great
	To take control of her    trembles near feathers    planes head-down
	The quick movements of bird-necks turning her head    gold eyes the insight-
	eyesight of owls blazing into the hencoops    a taste for chicken overwhelming
	Her    the long-range vision of hawks enlarging all human lights of cars
	Freight trains    looped bridges    enlarging the moon racing slowly
	Through all the curves of a river    all the darks of the midwest blazing
	From above. A rabbit in a bush turns white    the smothering chickens
	Huddle    for over them there is still time for something to live
	With the streaming half-idea of a long stoop    a hurtling    a fall
	That is controlled    that plummets as it wills    turns gravity
	Into a new condition, showing its other side like a moon    shining
	New Powers    there is still time to live on a breath made of nothing
	But the whole night    time for her to remember to arrange her skirt
	Like a diagram of a bat    tightly it guides her    she has this flying-skin
	Made of garments    and there are also those sky-divers on tv    sailing
	In sunlight    smiling under their goggles    swapping batons back and forth
	And He who jumped without a chute and was handed one by a diving
	Buddy. She looks for her grinning companion    white teeth    nowhere
	She is screaming    singing hymns    her thin human wings spread out
	From her neat shoulders    the air beast-crooning to her    warbling
	And she can no longer behold the huge partial form of the world    now
	She is watching her country lose its evoked master shape    watching it lose
	And gain    get back its houses and peoples    watching it bring up
	Its local lights    single homes    lamps on barn roofs    if she fell
	Into water she might live    like a diver    cleaving    perfect    plunge
	
	Into another    heavy silver    unbreathable    slowing    saving
	Element: there is water    there is time to perfect all the fine
	Points of diving    feet together    toes pointed    hands shaped right
	To insert her into water like a needle    to come out healthily dripping
	And be handed a Coca-Cola    there they are    there are the waters
	Of life    the moon packed and coiled in a reservoir    so let me begin
	To plane across the night air of Kansas    opening my eyes superhumanly
	Bright    to the damned moon    opening the natural wings of my jacket
	By Don Loper    moving like a hunting owl toward the glitter of water
	One cannot just fall    just tumble screaming all that time    one must use
	It    she is now through with all    through all    clouds    damp    hair
	Straightened    the last wisp of fog pulled apart on her face like wool revealing
	New darks    new progressions of headlights along dirt roads from chaos
	
	And night    a gradual warming    a new-made, inevitable world of one’s own
	Country    a great stone of light in its waiting waters    hold    hold out
	For water: who knows when what correct young woman must take up her body
	And fly    and head for the moon-crazed inner eye of midwest imprisoned
	Water    stored up for her for years    the arms of her jacket slipping
	Air up her sleeves to go    all over her? What final things can be said
	Of one who starts her sheerly in her body in the high middle of night
	Air    to track down water like a rabbit where it lies like life itself
	Off to the right in Kansas? She goes toward    the blazing-bare lake
	Her skirts neat    her hands and face warmed more and more by the air
	Rising from pastures of beans    and under her    under chenille bedspreads
	The farm girls are feeling the goddess in them struggle and rise brooding
	On the scratch-shining posts of the bed    dreaming of female signs
	Of the moon    male blood like iron    of what is really said by the moan
	Of airliners passing over them at dead of midwest midnight    passing
	Over brush fires    burning out in silence on little hills    and will wake
	To see the woman they should be    struggling on the rooftree to become
	Stars: for her the ground is closer    water is nearer    she passes
	It    then banks    turns    her sleeves fluttering differently as she rolls
	Out to face the east, where the sun shall come up from wheatfields she must
	Do something with water    fly to it    fall in it    drink it    rise
	From it    but there is none left upon earth    the clouds have drunk it back
	The plants have sucked it down    there are standing toward her only
	The common fields of death    she comes back from flying to falling
	Returns to a powerful cry    the silent scream with which she blew down
	The coupled door of the airliner    nearly    nearly losing hold
	Of what she has done    remembers    remembers the shape at the heart
	Of cloud    fashionably swirling    remembers she still has time to die
	Beyond explanation. Let her now take off her hat in summer air the contour
	Of cornfields    and have enough time to kick off her one remaining
	Shoe with the toes    of the other foot    to unhook her stockings
	With calm fingers, noting how fatally easy it is to undress in midair
	Near death    when the body will assume without effort any position
	Except the one that will sustain it    enable it to rise    live
	Not die    nine farms hover close    widen    eight of them separate, leaving
	One in the middle    then the fields of that farm do the same    there is no
	Way to back off    from her chosen ground    but she sheds the jacket
	With its silver sad impotent wings    sheds the bat’s guiding tailpiece
	Of her skirt    the lightning-charged clinging of her blouse    the intimate
	Inner flying-garment of her slip in which she rides like the holy ghost
	Of a virgin    sheds the long windsocks of her stockings    absurd
	Brassiere    then feels the girdle required by regulations squirming
	Off her: no longer monobuttocked    she feels the girdle flutter    shake
	In her hand    and float    upward    her clothes rising off her ascending
	Into cloud    and fights away from her head the last sharp dangerous shoe
	Like a dumb bird    and now will drop in    soon    now will drop
	
	In like this    the greatest thing that ever came to Kansas    down from all
	Heights    all levels of American breath    layered in the lungs from the frail
	Chill of space to the loam where extinction slumbers in corn tassels thickly
	And breathes like rich farmers counting: will come along them after
	Her last superhuman act    the last slow careful passing of her hands
	All over her unharmed body    desired by every sleeper in his dream:
	Boys finding for the first time their loins filled with heart’s blood
	Widowed farmers whose hands float under light covers to find themselves
	Arisen at sunrise    the splendid position of blood unearthly drawn
	Toward clouds    all feel something    pass over them as she passes
	Her palms over her long legs    her small breasts    and deeply between
	Her thighs    her hair shot loose from all pins    streaming in the wind
	Of her body    let her come openly    trying at the last second to land
	On her back    This is it    this
	                                                         All those who find her impressed
	In the soft loam    gone down    driven well into the image of her body
	The furrows for miles flowing in upon her where she lies very deep
	In her mortal outline    in the earth as it is in cloud    can tell nothing
	But that she is there    inexplicable    unquestionable    and remember
	That something broke in them as well    and began to live and die more
	When they walked for no reason into their fields to where the whole earth
	Caught her    interrupted her maiden flight    told her how to lie she cannot
	Turn    go away    cannot move    cannot slide off it and assume another
	Position    no sky-diver with any grin could save her    hold her in his arms
	Plummet with her    unfold above her his wedding silks    she can no longer
	Mark the rain with whirling women that take the place of a dead wife
	Or the goddess in Norwegian farm girls    or all the back-breaking whores
	Of Wichita. All the known air above her is not giving up quite one
	Breath    it is all gone    and yet not dead    not anywhere else
	Quite    lying still in the field on her back    sensing the smells
	Of incessant growth try to lift her    a little sight left in the corner
	Of one eye    fading    seeing something wave    lies believing
	That she could have made it    at the best part of her brief goddess
	State    to water    gone in headfirst    come out smiling    invulnerable
	Girl in a bathing-suit ad    but she is lying like a sunbather at the last
	Of moonlight    half-buried in her impact on the earth    not far
	From a railroad trestle    a water tank    she could see if she could
	Raise her head from her modest hole    with her clothes beginning
	To come down all over Kansas    into bushes    on the dewy sixth green
	Of a golf course    one shoe    her girdle coming down fantastically
	On a clothesline, where it belongs    her blouse on a lightning rod:
	
	Lies in the fields    in this field    on her broken back as though on
	A cloud she cannot drop through    while farmers sleepwalk without
	Their women from houses    a walk like falling toward the far waters
	Of life    in moonlight    toward the dreamed eternal meaning of their farms
	Toward the flowering of the harvest in their hands    that tragic cost
	Feels herself go    go toward    go outward    breathes at last fully
	Not    and tries    less    once    tries    tries    ah, god--



3. THE FIREBOMBING

	_Deke daran, dass nach den grossen Zerstörungen
	Jedermann beweisen wird, dass er unschuldig war._
					Günter Bich
	
	_Or hast thou an arm like God?_
					The Book of Job
	
	Home-owners unite.
	
	All families lie together, though some are burned alive.
	The others try to feel
	For them. Some can, it is often said.
	
	Starve and take off
	
	Twenty years in the suburbs, and the palm trees willingly leap
	Into the flashlights,
	And there is beneath them also
	A booted crackling of snailshells and coral-sticks.
	There are cowl-flaps and the tilt’ cross of propellers,
	The shovel-marked clouds’ far sides against the moon,
	The enemy filling up the hills
	With ceremonial graves. At my somewhere among these,
	
	Snap, a bulb is tricked on in the cockpit
	
	And some technical-minded stranger with my hands
	Is sitting in a glass treasure-hole of blue light,
	Having potential fire under the undeodorized arms
	Of his wings, on thin bomb-shackles,
	The “tear-drop-shaped” 300-gallon drop-tanks
	Filled with napalm and gasoline.
	
	Thinking forward ten minutes
	From that, there is also the burst straight out
	Of the overcast into the moon; there is now
	The moon-metal-shine of propellers, the quarter-
	moonstone, aimed at the waves,
	Stopped on the cumulus.
	
	There is then this re-entry
	Into cloud, for the engines to ponder their sound.
	In white dark the aircraft shrinks; Japan
	
	Dilates around it like a thought.
	Coming out, the one who is here is over
	Land, passing over the all-night grainfields,
	In dark paint over
	The woods with one silver side,
	Rice-water calm at all levels
	Of the terraced hill.
	
					Enemy rivers and trees
	Sliding off me like snakeskin,
	Strips of vapor spooled from the wingtips
	
	Going    invisible    passing    over    on
	Over    bridges    roads for night-walkers
	Sunday night in the enemy’s country    absolute
	Calm  the moon’s face    coming    slowly
	About
		the inland sea
	Slants    is woven with wire thread
	Levels out    holds together like a quilt
	Of the starboard wing    cloud flickers
	At my glassed-off forehead    the moon’s now and again
	Uninterrupted face going forward
	Over the waves in a glide-path
	Lost into land.
	
	Going: going with it
	
	Combat booze by my side in a cratered canteen,
	Bourbon frighteningly mixed
	With GI pineapple juice,
	Dogs trembling under me for hundreds of miles, on many
	Islands, sleep-smelling that ungodly mixture
	Of napalm and high-octane fuel,
	Good bourbon and GI juice.
	
	Rivers circling behind me around
	Come to the fore, and bring
	A town with everyone darkened.
	Five thousand people are sleeping off
	An all-day American drone.
	Twenty years in the suburbs have not shown me
	Which ones were hit and which not.
	
	Haul on the wheel    racking slowly
	The aircraft blackly around
	In a dark dream    that    that is
	That is like flying inside someone’s head
	
	Think of this    think of this
	I did not think of my house
	
	But think of my house now
	Where the lawn-mower rests on its laurels
	Where the diet exists
	For my own good    where I try to drop
	Twenty years, eating figs in the pantry
	Blinded by each and all
	Of the eye-catching cans that gladly have caught my wife’s eye
	Until I cannot say
	Where the screwdriver is    where the children
	Get off the bus    where the new
	Scoutmaster lives    where the fly
	Hones his front legs    where the hammock folds
	Its erotic daydreams    where the Sunday
	School text for the day has been put
	where the fire
	Wood is    where the payments
	For everything under the sun
	Pile peacefully up,
	
	But in this half-paid-for pantry
	Among the red lids that screw off
	With an easy half-twist to the left
	And the long drawers crammed with dim spoons,
	I still have charge--secret charge--
	Of the fire developed to cling
	To everything: to golf carts and fingernail
	Scissors as yet unborn    tennis shoes
	Grocery baskets    toy fire engines
	New Buicks stalled by the half-moon
	
	Shining at midnight on crossroads    green paint
	Of jolly garden tools    red Christmas ribbons:
	
	Not atoms, these, but glue inspired
	By love of country to burn,
	The apotheosis of gelatin.
	
	Behind me having risen the Southern Cross
	Set up by chaplains in the Ryukyus--
	Orion, Scorpio, the immortal silver
	Like the myths of king-
	insects at swarming-time--
	One mosquito, dead drunk
	On altitude, drones on, far under the engines,
	And bites between
	The oxygen mask and the eye.
	The enemy-colored skin of families
	Determines to hold its color
	In sleep, as my hand turns whiter
	Than ever, clutching the toggle--
	The ship shakes    bucks
	Fire hangs    not yet fire
	In the air above Beppu
	For I am fulfilling
	An “anti-morale” raid upon it.
	All leashes of dogs
	Break under the first bomb, around those
	In bed, or late in the public baths: around those
	Who inch forward on their hands
	Into medicinal waters.
	Their heads come up with a roar
	Of Chicago fire:
	Come up with the carp pond showing
	The bath-house upside down,
	Standing stiller to show it more
	As I sail artistically over
	The resort town followed by farms,
	Singing and twisting
	All the handles in heaven    kicking
	The small cattle off their feet
	In a red costly blast
	Flinging jelly over the walls
	As in a chemical war-
	fare field demonstration.
	With fire of mine like a cat
	
	Holding onto another man’s walls,
	My hat should crawl on my head
	In streetcars, thinking of it,
	The fat on my body should pale.
	
	Gun down
	The engine, the eight blades sighing
	For the moment when the roofs will connect
	Their flames, and make a town burning with all
	American fire.
	               Reflections of houses catch;
	Fire shuttles from pond to pond
	In every direction, till hundreds flash with one death.
	With this in the dark of the mind,
	Death will not be what it should:
	Will not, even now, even when
	My exhaled face in the mirror
	Of bars, dilates in a cloud like Japan.
	The death of children is ponds
	Shutter-flashing; responding mirrors; it climbs
	The terraces of hills
	Smaller and smaller, a mote of red dust
	At a hundred feet; at a hundred and one it goes out
	That is what should have got in
	To my eye
	
	And shown the insides of houses, the low tables
	Catch fire from the floor mats,
	Blaze up in gas around their heads
	Like a dream of suddenly growing
	Too intense for war. Ah, under one’s dark arms
	Something strange-scented falls--when those on earth
	Die, there is not even sound;
	One is cool and enthralled in the cockpit,
	Turned blue by the power of beauty,
	In a pale treasure-hole of soft light
	Deep in aesthetic contemplation,
	Seeing the ponds catch fire
	And cast it through ring after ring
	Of land: O death in the middle
	Of acres of inch-deep water!    Useless
	
	Firing    small arms
	Speckles    from the river
	Bank    one ninety millimeter
	Misses    far down    wrong petals    gone
	
	It is this detachment,
	The honored aesthetic evil,
	The greatest sense of power in one’s life,
	That must be shed in bars, or by whatever
	Means, by starvation
	Visions in well-stocked pantries:
	The moment when the moon sails in between
	The tail-booms    the rudders nod    I swing
	Over    directly over the heart
	
	The _heart_ of the fire. A mosquito burns out on my cheek
	With the cold of my face
	there are the eyes
	In blue light    bar-light
	All masked but them    the moon
	Crossing from left to right    in the streams below
	Oriental fish form quickly
	In the chemical shine,
	In their eyes one tiny seed
	Of deranged, Old Testament light.
	
	Letting go    letting go
	The plane rises gently    dark forms
	Glide off me    long water    pales
	In safe zones    a new cry enters
	The voice-box of chained family dogs
	
	We buck    leap over something
	Not there    settle back
	Leave it    leave it clinging and crying
	It consumes them in a hot
	Body-flash, old age or menopause
	Of children, clings and burns
	               eating through
	And when a reed mat catches fire
	From me, it explodes through field after field
	Bearing its sleeper    another
	
	Bomb finds a home
	And clings to it like a child. And so
	
	Goodbye to the grassy mountains
	To cloud streaming from the night engines
	Flags    pennons    curved silks
	Of air    myself streaming also
	
	My body covered
	With flags, the air of flags
	Between the engines.
	Forever I do sleep in that position,
	Forever in a turn
	For home that breaks out streaming banners
	From my wingtips,
	Wholly in position to admire.
	
	O then I knock it off
	And turn for home over the black complex thread worked
	    through
	The silver night-sea,
	Following the huge, moon-washed stepping-stones
	Of the Ryukyus south,
	The nightgrass of mountains billowing softly
	In my rising heat.
	               Turn and tread down
	The yellow stones of the islands
	To where Okinawa burns,
	Pure gold, on the radar screen,
	Beholding beneath me the actual island form
	In the vast water-silver poured just above solid ground,
	An inch of water extending for thousands of miles
	Above flat ploughland. Say “down,” and it is done.
	
	All this, and I am still hungry,
	Still twenty years overweight, still unable
	To get down there or see
	What really happened.
	               But it may be that I could not,
	If I tried, say to any
	Who lived there, deep in my flames:    say, in cold
	Grinning sweat, as to another
	
	Of these home-owners who are always curving
	Near me down the different-grassed street:    say
	As though to the neighbor
	I borrowed the hedge-clippers from
	On the darker-grassed side of the two,
	Come in, my house is yours, come in
	If you can, if you
	Can pass this unfured door. It is that I can imagine
	At the threshold nothing
	With its ears crackling off
	Like powdery leaves,
	Nothing with children of ashes, nothing not
	Amiable, gentle, well-meaning,
	A little nervous for no
	Reason    a little worried    a little too loud
	Or too easy-going    nothing I haven’t lived with
	For twenty years, still nothing not as
	American as I am, and proud of it.
	
	Absolution? Sentence? No matter;
	The thing itself is in that.



4. FOR THE LAST WOLVERINE

	They will soon be down
	
	To one, but he still will be
	For a little while    still will be stopping
	
	The flakes in the air with a look,
	Surrounding himself with the silence
	Of whitening snarls. Let him eat
	The last red meal of the condemned
	
	To extinction, tearing the guts
	
	From an elk. Yet that is not enough
	For me. I would have him eat
	
	The heart, and from it, have an idea
	Stream into his gnarling head
	That he no longer has a thing
	To lose, and so can walk
	
	Out into the open, in the full
	
	Pale of the sub-Arctic sun
	Where a single spruce tree is dying
	
	Higher and higher. Let him climb it
	With all his meanness and strength.
	Lord, we have come to the end
	Of this kind of vision of heaven,
	
	As the sky breaks open
	
	Its fans around him and shimmers
	And into its northern gates he rises
	
	Snarling    complete    in the joy of a weasel
	With an elk’s horned heart in his stomach
	Looking straight into the eternal
	Blue, where he hauls his kind. I would have it all
	
	My way: at the top of that tree I place
	
	The New World’s last eagle
	Hunched in mangy feathers    giving
	
	Up on the theory of flight.
	Dear God of the wildness of poetry, let them mate
	To the death in the rotten branches,
	Let the tree sway and burst into flame
	
	And mingle them, crackling with feathers,
	
	In crownfire. Let something come
	Of it    something gigantic    legendary
	
	Rise beyond reason over hills
	Of ice    SCREAMING    that it cannot die,
	That it has come back, this time
	On wings, and will spare no earthly thing:
	
	That it will hover, made purely of northern
	
	Lights, at dusk    and fall
	On men building roads: will perch
	
	On the moose’s horn like a falcon
	Riding into battle    into holy war against
	Screaming railroad crews: will pull
	Whole traplines like fibres from the snow
	
	In the long-jawed night of fur trappers.
	
	But, small, filthy, unwinged,
	You will soon be crouching
	
	Alone, with maybe some dim racial notion
	Of being the last, but none of how much
	Your unnoticed going will mean:
	How much the timid poem needs
	
	The mindless explosion of your rage,
	
	The glutton’s internal fire    the elk’s
	Heart in the belly, sprouting wings,
	
	The pact of the “blind swallowing
	Thing,” with himself, to eat
	The world, and not to be driven off it
	Until it is gone, even if it takes
	
	Forever. I take you as you are
	
	And make of you what I will,
	Skunk-bear, carcajou, bloodthirsty
	
	Non-survivor.
	                       _Lord, let me die    but not die
	Out._



5. MAY DAY SERMON

	Each year at this time I shall be telling you of the Lord
	-- Fog, gamecock, snake, and neighbor -- giving men all the help they need
	To drag their daughters into barns. Children, I shall be showing you
	The fox-hide stretched on the door     like a flying-squirrel     fly
	Open     to show you the dark where the one pole of light is paid out
	In spring by the loft, and in it the croker sacks sprawling and shuttling
	Themselves into place as it comes     comes     through spiders dead
	Drunk on their threads     the hogs’ fat bristling     the milk
	Snake in the rafters unbending through gnats to touch the last place
	Alive on the sun with his tongue     I shall be flickering from my mouth
	Oil     grease-cans     lard-cans     nubbins     cobs     night
	Coming     floating     each May with night coming I cannot help
	Telling you how he hauls her to the centerpole     how the tractor moves
	Over as he sets his feet and hauls     hauls     ravels her arms and hair
	In stump-chains:   Telling:   telling of Jehovah come and gone
	Down on His belly     descending     creek-curving     blowing His legs
	
	Like candles, out     putting North Georgia copper on His head
	To crawl in under the door in dust red enough to breathe
	The breath of Adam into:   Children, be brought where she screams and begs
	To the sacks of corn and coal     to nails     to the swelling ticks
	On the near side of mules, for the Lord’s own man has found the limp
	Rubber that lies in the gulley     the penis-skin like a serpent
	Under the weaving willow.
	                                           Listen:   often a girl in the country,
	Mostly sweating     mostly in spring, deep enough in the holy Bible
	Belt, will feel her hair rise up     arms rise, and this not any wish
	
	Of hers, and clothes like lint shredding off her     abominations
	In the sight of the Lord:   will hear the Book speak like a father
	Gone mad:   each year at this time will hear the utmost sound
	Of herself, as her lungs cut, one after one, every long track
	Spiders have coaxed from their guts     stunned spiders fall
	Into Pandemonium     fall     fall     and begin to dance like a girl
	On the red clay floor of Hell     she screaming     her father screaming
	Scripture     CHAPter and verse     beating it into her with a weeping
	Willow branch     the animals stomping     she prancing and climbing
	Her hair     beasts shifting from foot to foot about the stormed
	Steel of the anvil     the tractor gaslessly straining     believing
	It must pull up a stump     pull     pull down the walls of the barn
	Like Dagon’s temple     set the Ark of the Lord in its place     change all
	Things for good, by pain.   Each year at this time you will be looking up
	Gnats in the air     they boil     recombine     go mad with striving
	To form the face of her lover, as when he lay at Nickajack Creek
	With her by his motorcycle     looming     face trembling with exhaust
	Fumes     humming insanely -- each May you hear her father scream like God
	And King James as he flails     cuds richen     bulls chew themselves white-faced
	Deeper into their feed bags, and he cries something the Lord     cries
	Words! Words! Ah, when they leap     when they are let out of the Bible’s
	Black box     they whistle     they grab the nearest girl and do her hair up
	For her lover in root-breaking chains     and she knows she was born to hang
	In the middle of Gilmer County     to dance, on May Day, with holy
	Words all around her     with beasts with insects     O children NOW
	In five bags of chicken-feed the torsos of prophets form     writhe
	Die out as her freckled flesh     as flesh and the Devil twist and turn
	Her body to love     cram her mouth with defiance     give her words
	To battle with the Bible’s in the air:  she shrieks sweet Jesus and God
	
	I’m glad     O my God-darling     O lover     O angel-stud     dear heart
	Of life put it in me     give     you’re killing     KILLING:  each
	Night each year at this time I shall be telling you of the snake-
	doctor drifting from the loft, a dragonfly, where she is wringing
	Out the tractor’s muddy chains     where her cotton socks prance,
	Where her shoes as though one ankle were broken, stand with night
	Coming     and creatures drawn by the stars, out of their high holes
	By moon-hunger driven     part the leaves     crawl out of Grimes Nose
	And Brasstown Bald:  on this night only I can tell how the weasel pauses
	Each year in the middle of the road     looks up at the evening blue
	Star     to hear her say again     O again     YOU CAN BEAT ME TO DEATH 
	And I’ll still be glad:
	                                Sisters, it is time to show you rust
	Smashing the lard-cans more in     spring after spring     bullbats
	Swifts     barn swallows     mule-bits clashing on walls     mist turning
	Up white out of warm creeks:  all over, fog taking the soul from the body
	Of water     gaining     rising up trees     sifting up through smoking green
	Frenzied levels of gamecocks sleeping from the roots     stream-curves
	Of mist:  wherever on God’s land is water, roads rise up the shape of rivers
	Of no return:  O sisters, it is time     you cannot sleep with Jehovah
	
	Searching for what to be, on ground that has called Him from His Book:  
	Shall He be the pain in the willow, or the copperhead’s kingly riding
	In kudzu, growing with vines toward the cows     or the wild face working over
	A virgin, swarming like gnats     or the grass of the west field, bending
	East, to sweep into bags and turn brown     or shall He rise, white on white,
	From Nickajack Creek as a road?  The barn creaks like an Ark     beasts
	Smell everywhere the streams drawn out by their souls     the flood-
	sigh of grass in the spring     they shall be saved     they know as she screams 
	Of sin     as the weasel stares     the hog strains toward the woods 
	That hold its primeval powers:
	                                                Often a girl in the country will find herself 
	Dancing with God in a mule’s eye, twilight drifting in straws from the dark
	Overhead of hay     cows working their sprained jaws sideways at the hour
	Of night all things are called:   when gnats in their own midst and fury
	Of swarming-time, crowd into the barn     their sixty-year day consumed
	In this sunset     die in a great face of light that swarms and screams
	Of love.
	               Each May you will crouch like a sawhorse to make yourself
	More here     you will be cow-chips     chickens croaking for her hands
	That shook the corn over the ground     bouncing     kicked this way
	And that, by the many beaks     and every last one of you will groan
	Like nails barely holding     and your hair be full of the gray
	Glints of stump-chains.     Children, each year at this time you will have
	Back-pain, but also heaven     but also     also this lovely other life-
	pain between the thighs:  woman-child or woman in bed in Gilmer
	County     smiling in sleep like blood-beast and Venus together
	Dancing the road as I speak, get up     up in your socks and take
	The pain you were born for:   that rose through her body straight
	Up from the earth like a plant, like the process that raised overhead
	The limbs of the uninjured willow.
	                                                       Children, it is true
	That the kudzu advances, its copperheads drunk and tremendous
	With hiding, toward the cows     and wild fences cannot hold the string
	Beans as they overshoot their fields:   that in May the weasel loves love
	As much as blood     that in the dusk bottoms young deer stand half
	In existence, munching cornshucks     true that when the wind blows
	Right     Nickajack releases its mist     the willow leaves stiffen once
	More     altogether     you can hear     each year at this time you can hear
	No     Now, no     Now     Yes     Again     More     O     O my God     
	I love it     love you     don’t leave     don’t     don’t stop O GLORY
	Be:
	     More dark     more coming     fox-fire crawls over the okra-
	patch     as through it a real fox creeps to claim his father’s fur
	Flying on doornails     the quartermoon on the outhouse begins to shine
	With the quartermoonlight of this night     as she falls and rises,
	Chained to a sapling like a tractor     WHIPPED for the wind in the willow
	Tree     WHIPPED for Bathsheba and David     WHIPPED for the woman taken
	Anywhere     anytime     WHIPPED for the virgin sighing     bleeding
	From her body     for the sap and green of the year     for her own good
	And evil:
	              Sisters, who is your lover?   Has he done nothing but come
	And go?   Has your father nailed his cast skin to the wall as evidence
	Of sin?   Is it flying like a fox in the darkness     dripping pure radiant venom
	Of manhood?  
	                        Yes, but heis unreeling in hills between his long legs
	The concrete of the highway     his face in the moon beginning
	To burn     twitch     dance like an overhead swarm     he feels a nail
	Beat through his loins far away     he rises in pain and delight, as spirit
	Enters his sex     sways     forms     rises with the forced, choked red
	Blood of her red-headed image, in the red-dust, Adam-colored clay
	Whirling and leaping     creating     calling:  O on the dim, gray man-
	track of cement flowing into his mouth     each year he turns the moon back
	Around on his handlebars     her image going all over him like the wind
	Blasting up his sleeves.   He turns off the highway, and
	                                                                                         Ah, children,
	There is now something else to hear:  there is now this madness of engine
	Noise in the bushes     past reason     ungodly     squealing     reverting
	Like a hog turned loose in the woods     Yes, as he passes the first
	Trees of God’s land     game-hens overhead     and the farm is ON
	Him     everything is more     more     MORE as he enters the black
	Bible’s white swirling ground     O daughters     his heartbeat great
	With trees     some blue leaves coming     NOW     and right away fire
	In the right eye     Lord     more     MORE     O Glory     land
	Of Glory:  ground-branches hard to get through     coops where fryers huddle
	To death, as the star-beast dances and scratches at their home-boards,
	His rubber stiffens on its nails:  Sisters, understand about men and sheaths:
	
	About nakedness:  understand how butterflies, amazed, pass out
	Of their natal silks     how the tight snake takes a great breath     bursts
	Through himself and leaves himself behind     how a man casts finally
	Off everything that shields him from another     beholds his loins
	Shine with his children forever     burn with the very juice
	Of resurrection:  such shining is how the spring creek comes
	Forth from its sunken rocks     it is how the trout foams and turns on     
	Himself     heads upstream, breathing mist like water, for the cold
	Mountain of his birth     flowing     sliding in and through the ego-
	maniacal sleep of gamecocks     shooting past a man with one new blind
	Side     who feels his skinned penis rise like a fish through the dark
	Woods, in a strange lifted-loving form     a snake about to burst
	Through itself on May Day     and leave behind on the ground     still
	Still     the shape of a fooled thing’s body:
	                                                                  he comes on     comes
	Through the laurel, wiped out on his right by an eye-twig     now he
	Is crossing the cow track     his hat in his hand going on before
	His face     then up     slowly over     over like the Carolina moon
	Coming into Georgia     feels the farm close its Bible and ground-
	fog over him     his dark side blazing     something whipping
	By, beyond sight:   each year at this time I shall be letting you
	
	Know when she cannot stand     when the chains fall back on
	To the tractor     when you should get up     when neither she nor the pole
	Has any more sap     and her striped arms and red hair must keep her
	From falling     when she feels God’s willow laid on her, at last,
	With no more pressure than hay, and she has finished crying to her lover’s
	Shifting face     and his hand when he gave it     placed it, unconsumed,
	In her young burning bush.   Each year by dark she has learned
	
	That home is to hang in     home is where your father cuts the baby
	Fat from your flanks for the Lord, as you scream for the viny foreskin
	Of the motorcycle rider.  Children, by dark     by now, when he drops
	The dying branch and lets her down     when the red clay flats
	Of her feet hit the earth     all things have heard -- fog, gamecock
	Snake, and lover -- and we listen:  Listen children, for the fog to lift
	The form of sluggish creeks into the air:   each spring, each creek
	On the Lord’s land flows in two     O sisters, lovers, flows in two
	Places:   where it was, and in the low branches of pines where chickens
	Sleep in mist     and that is where you will find roads floating free
	Of the earth     winding     leading unbrokenly out of the farm of God
	The father:
	                  Each year at this time she is coming from the barn     she
	Falls once, hair hurting her back     stumbles walking naked
	With dignity     walks with no help to the house     lies face-down
	In her room, burning     tuning in     hearing in the spun rust-
	groan of bedsprings, his engine root and thunder like a pig,
	Knowing who it is     must be     knowing that the face of gnats will wake,
	In the woods, as a man:   there is nothing else this time of night
	But her dream of having wheels between her legs:   tires, man,
	Everything she can hold, pulsing together     her father walking
	Reading     intoning     calling     his legs blown out by the ground-
	fogging creeks of his land:  :  Listen     listen like females each year
	In May     O glory     to the sound     the sound of your man gone wild
	With love in the woods     let your nipples rise     and leave your feet
	To hear:  This is when moths flutter in from the open, and Hell
	Fire of the oil lamp shrivels them and     it is said
	To her:   said like the Lord’s voice trying to find a way
	Outside the Bible     O sisters     O women and children who will be
	Women of Gilmer County     you farm girls and Ellijay cotton mill
	Girls, get up     each May Day     up in your socks     it is the father
	Sound     going on about God     making, a hundred feet down,
	The well beat its bucket like a gong:  she goes to the kitchen,
	Stands with the inside grain of pinewood whirling on her like a cloud
	Of wire     picks up a useful object     two     they are not themselves
	Tonight     each hones itself as the moon does     new by phases
	Of fog     floating unchanged into the house     coming atom
	By atom     sheepswool     different smokes     breathed like the Word
	Of nothing, round her seated father.   Often a girl in the country,
	Mostly in spring     mostly bleeding     deep enough in the holy Bible
	Belt     will feel her arms rise up     up     and this not any wish
	Of hers     will stand, waiting for word.   O daughters, he is rambling
	In Obadiah     the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou
	That dwelleth in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high
	That saith in his heart     O daughters     who shall bring me down
	To the ground?   And she comes down     putting her back into
	The hatchet     often     often     he is brought down     laid out
	Lashing     smoking     sucking wind:   Children, each year at this time
	A girl will tend to take an ice pick in both hands     a lone pine
	Needle     will hover     hover:  Children, each year at this time
	Things happen quickly     and it is easy for a needle to pass
	Through the eye of a man bound for Heaven she leaves it     naked goes
	Without further sin through the house     floating in and out of all
	Four rooms     comes onto the porch on cloud-feet     steps down and out
	And around to the barn     pain changing     her old screams hanging
	By the hair around her:   Children, in May, often a girl in the country
	Will find herself lifting wood     her arms like hair rising up
	To undo locks     raise latches     set gates aside     turn all things
	Loose     shoo them out     shove     pull     O hogs are leaping ten
	Million years back through fog     cows walking worriedly     passing out
	Of the Ark     from stalls where God’s voice cursed and mumbled
	At milking-time     moving     moving     disappearing     drifting
	In cloud     cows in the alders already lowing far off     no one
	Can find them each year:  she comes back to the house and grabs double
	Handfuls of clothes
	                                 and her lover, with his one eye of amazing grace
	Of sight, sees her coming as she was born     swirling     developing
	Toward him     she hears him grunt     she hears him creaking
	His saddle     dead-engined     she conjures one foot whole from the ground-
	fog to climb him behind     he stands up     stomps     catches     roars
	Blasts the leaves from a blinding twig     wheels     they blaze up
	Together     she breathing to match him     her hands on his warm belly
	His hard blood renewing like a snake     O now     now as he twists
	His wrist, and takes off with their bodies:
	                                                                  each May you will hear it
	Said that the sun came as always     the sun of next day burned
	Them off with the mist:   that when the river fell back on its bed
	Of water     they fell from life     from limbs     they went with it
	To Hell     three-eyed     in love, their legs around an engine, her arms
	Around him.   But now, except for each year at this time, their sound
	Has died:   except when the creek-bed thicks its mist     gives up
	The white of its flow to the air     comes off     lifts into the pine-poles
	Of May Day     comes back as you come awake in your socks and crotch-hair
	On new-mooned nights of spring     I speak     you listen and the pines fill
	With motorcycle sound as they rise, stoned out of their minds on the white
	Lightning of fog     singing     the saddle bags full of her clothes
	Flying     snagging     shoes hurling away     stockings grabbed-off
	Unwinding and furling on twigs:   all we know     all we could follow
	Them by was her underwear     was stocking after stocking where it tore
	Away, and a long slip stretched on a thorn     all these few gave
	Out.   Children, you know it:   that place was where they took
	Off into the air     died     disappeared     entered my mouth     your mind
	Each year     each pale, curved breath     each year as she holds him
	Closer wherever he hurtles     taking her     taking her     she going forever
	Where he goes     with the highways of rivers     through one-eyed
	Twigs     through clouds of chickens     and grass with them bends
	Double     the animals lift their heads     peanuts and beans exchange
	Shells in joy     joy like the speed of the body and rock-bottom
	Joy:   joy by which the creek-bed appeared to bear them out of the Bible
	‘s farm     through pine-clouds of gamecocks where no earthly track
	Is, but those risen out of warm currents     streams born to hang
	In the pines of Nickajack Creek:  tonight her hands are under
	His crackling jacket     the pain in her back enough to go through
	Them both     her buttocks blazing in the sheepskin saddle:   tell those
	
	Who look for them     who follow by rayon stockings     who look on human
	Highways     on tracks of cement and gravel     black weeping roads
	Of tar:  tell them that she and her rider have taken no dirt
	Nor any paved road     no path for cattle     no county trunk or trail
	Or any track upon earth, but have roared like a hog on May Day
	Through pines and willows:  that when he met the insane vine
	Of the scuppernong     he tilted his handlebars back and took
	The road that rises in the cold mountain spring from warm creeks:
	O women in your rayon from Lindale, I shall be telling you to go
	To Hell     by cloud     down where the chicken-walk is running
	To weeds     and anyone can show you where the tire-marks gave out
	And her last stocking was cast     and you stand as still as a weasel
	Under Venus     before you dance     dance yourself blue with blood-
	joy looking into the limbs     looking up into where they rode
	Through cocks tightening roots with their sleep-claws. Children,
	They are gone:  gone as the owl rises, when God takes the stone
	Blind sun off its eyes, and it sees     sees hurtle in the utter dark
	Gold of its sight, a boy and a girl buried deep in the cloud
	Of their speed     drunk, children     drunk with pain and the throttle
	Wide open, in love     with a mindless sound     with her red hair
	In the wind streaming gladly for them both     more than gladly
	As the barn settles under the weight of its pain     the stalls fill once
	More with trampling like Exodus     the snake-doctor gone the rats beginning
	On the last beans     and all the chicks she fed, each year at this time
	Burst from their eggs as she passes:
	                                                         Children, it is true that mice
	No longer bunch on the rafters, but wade the fields like the moon,
	Shifting in patches     ravenous     the horse floats, smoking with flies,
	To the water-trough     coming back less often     learning to make
	Do with the flowing drink of deer     the mountain standing     cold
	Flowing into his mouth     grass underfoot     dew     horse or what
	ever he is now     moves back into trees where the bull walks
	With a male light spread between his horns     some say screams like a girl
	And her father yelling together:
	                                                  Ah, this night in the dark laurel 
	Green of the quartermoon I shall be telling you that the creek’s last
	Ascension is the same     is made of water and air     heat and cold
	This year as before:   telling you not to believe every scream you hear
	Is the Bible’s:  it may be you or me     it may be her sinful barn-
	howling for the serpent, as her father whips her, using the tried
	And true rhythms of the Lord.   Sisters, an old man at times like this
	Moon, is always being found     yes found with an ice pick on his mind,
	A willow limb in his hand.   By now, the night-moths have come
	Have taken his Bible and read it     have flown, dissolved, having found
	Nothing in it for them.   I shall be telling you each moon     each
	Year at this time, Venus rises     the weasel goes mad at the death
	In the egg, of the chicks she fed for him by hand:  mad in the middle
	Of human space he dances     blue-eyed     dances with Venus rising
	Like blood-lust over the road     O tell your daughters     tell them
	That the creek’s ghost can still     O still can carry double
	Weight of true lovers     any time     any night as the wild turkeys claw
	Into the old pines of gamecocks, and with a cow’s tongue, the Bible calls
	For its own, and is not heard     and even God’s unsettled great white father
	head with its ear to the ground, cannot hear     know     cannot pick
	Up where they are     where her red hair is streaming through the white
	Hairs of His centerless breast:  with the moon     He cries with the cow all
	Its life penned up with Noah in the barn     talk of original
	Sin as the milk spurts     talk of women     talk of judgment and flood
	And the promised land:
	                                     Telling on May Day, children:  telling 
	That the animals are saved without rain that they are long gone
	From here     gone with the sun     gone with the woman taken
	In speed     gone with the one-eyed mechanic     that the barn falls in
	Like Jericho at the bull’s voice     at the weasel’s dance     at the hog’s
	Primeval squeal     the uncut hay walks when the wind prophesies in the west
	Pasture the animals move     roam, with kudzu creating all the earth
	East of the hayfield:  Listen:  each year at this time the county speaks
	With its beasts and sinners     with its blood     the county speaks of nothing
	Else each year at this time:  speaks as beasts speak to themselves
	Of holiness learned in the barn: Listen     O daughters     turn     turn
	In your sleep     rise with your backs on fire     in spring     in your socks
	Into the arms of your lovers:   every last one of you, listen one-eyed
	With your man     in hiding     in fog where the animals walk through 
	The white breast of the Lord     muttering     walk with nothing
	To do but be     in the spring laurel in the mist and self-sharpened
	Moon     walk through the resurrected creeks     through the Lord
	At their own pace     the cow shuts its mouth and the Bible is still
	Still open at anything     we are gone the barn     wanders over the earth.



6. THE PERFORMANCE

	The last time I saw Donald Armstrong   
	He was staggering oddly off into the sun,   
	Going down, off the Philippine Islands.   
	I let my shovel fall, and put that hand
	Above my eyes, and moved some way to one side
	That his body might pass through the sun,
	
	And I saw how well he was not
	Standing there on his hands,
	On his spindle-shanked forearms balanced,   
	Unbalanced, with his big feet looming and waving   
	In the great, untrustworthy air
	He flew in each night, when it darkened.
	
	Dust fanned in scraped puffs from the earth
	Between his arms, and blood turned his face inside out,   
	To demonstrate its suppleness
	Of veins, as he perfected his role.
	Next day, he toppled his head off
	On an island beach to the south,
	
	And the enemy’s two-handed sword   
	Did not fall from anyone’s hands   
	At that miraculous sight,
	As the head rolled over upon
	Its wide-eyed face, and fell
	Into the inadequate grave
	
	He had dug for himself, under pressure.   
	Yet I put my flat hand to my eyebrows   
	Months later, to see him again
	In the sun, when I learned how he died,   
	And imagined him, there,
	Come, judged, before his small captors,
	
	Doing all his lean tricks to amaze them—
	The back somersault, the kip-up—
	And at last, the stand on his hands,   
	Perfect, with his feet together,
	His head down, evenly breathing,
	As the sun poured from the sea
	
	And the headsman broke down   
	In a blaze of tears, in that light   
	Of the thin, long human frame   
	Upside down in its own strange joy,
	And, if some other one had not told him,   
	Would have cut off the feet
	
	Instead of the head,
	And if Armstrong had not presently risen   
	In kingly, round-shouldered attendance,   
	And then knelt down in himself
	Beside his hacked, glittering grave, having done   
	All things in this life that he could.
