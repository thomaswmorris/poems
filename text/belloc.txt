*** Hilaire Belloc (1870 - 1953)


1. BECAUSE MY FALTERING FEET

	Because my faltering feet may fail to dare
	The first descendant of the steps of Hell
	Give me the Word in time that triumphs there.
	I too must pass into the misty hollow
	Where all our living laughter stops: and hark!
	The tiny stuffless voices of the dark
	Have called me, called me, till I needs must follow:
	Give me the Word and I’ll attempt it well.
	
	Say it’s the little winking of an eye
	Which in that issue is uncurtained quite;
	A little sleep that helps a moment by
	Between the thin dawn and the large daylight.
	Ah! tell me more than yet was hoped of men;
	Swear that’s true now, and I’ll believe it then.



2. THE BIRDS

	When Jesus Christ was four years old
	The angels brought Him toys of gold,
	Which no man ever had bought or sold.
	
	And yet with these He would not play.
	He made Him small fowl out of clay,
	And blessed them till they flew away:
	Tu creasti Domine
	
	Jesus Christ, Thou child so wise,
	Bless mine hands and fill mine eyes,
	And bring my soul to Paradise.



3. THE DEATH AND LAST CONFESSION OF WANDERING PETER

	When Peter Wanderwide was young
	He wandered everywhere he would:
	All that he approved was sung,
	And most of what he saw was good.
	
	When Peter Wanderwide was thrown
	By Death himself beyond Auxerre,
	He chanted in heroic tone
	To priests and people gathered there:
	
	“If all that I have loved and seen
	Be with me on the Judgment Day,
	I shall be saved the crowd between
	From Satan and his foul array.
	
	“Almighty God will surely cry,
	‘St. Michael! Who is this that stands
	With Ireland in his dubious eye,
	And Perigord between his hands,
	
	“‘And on his arm the stirrup-thongs,
	And in his gait the narrow seas,
	And in his mouth Burgundian songs,
	But in his heart the Pyrenees?’
	
	“St. Michael then will answer right
	(And not without angelic shame),
	‘I seem to know his face by sight:
	I cannot recollect his name . . . ?’
	
	“St. Peter will befriend me then,
	Because my name is Peter too:
	‘I know him for the best of men
	That ever walloped barley brew.
	
	“‘And though I did not know him well
	And though his soul were clogged with sin,
	I hold the keys of Heaven and Hell.
	Be welcome, noble Peterkin.’
	
	“Then shall I spread my native wings
	And tread secure the heavenly floor,
	And tell the blessed doubtful things
	Of Val d’Aran and Perigord.”
	
	--
	
	This was the last and solemn jest
	Of weary Peter Wanderwide.
	He spoke it with a failing zest,
	And having spoken it, he died.



4. DECEMBER

	Hoar Time about the house betakes him slow,
	Seeking an entry for his weariness.
	And in that dreadful company distress
	And the sad night with silent footsteps go.
	On my poor fire the brands are scarce aglow,
	And in the woods without what memories press
	Where, waning in the trees from less to less,
	Mysterious hangs the hornéd moon and low.
	
	For now December, full of agéd care,
	Comes in upon the year and weakly grieves;
	Mumbling his lost desires and his despair; 
	And with mad trembling hand still interweaves,
	The dank sear flower-stalks tangled in his hair,
	While round about him whirl the rotten leaves.



5. THE HIPPOPOTAMUS

	I shoot the Hippopotamus
	With bullets made of platinum,
	Because if I use leaden ones
	His hide is sure to flatten ’em.



6. OCTOBER

	Look, how those steep woods on the mountain’s face
	Burn, burn against the sunset; now the cold
	Invades our very noon: the year’s grown old,
	Mornings are dark, and evenings come apace.
	The vines below have lost their purple grace,
	And in Forreze the white wrack backward rolled,
	Hangs to the hills tempestuous, fold on fold,
	And moaning gusts make desolate all the place.
	
	Mine host the month, at thy good hostelry,
	Tired limbs I’ll stretch and steaming beast I’ll tether;
	Pile on great logs with Gascon hand and free,
	And pour the Gascon stuff that laughs at weather;
	Swell your tough lungs, north wind, no whit care we,
	Singing old songs and drinking wine together.



7. THE REBEL

	There is a wall of which the stones 
	Are lies and bribes and dead men's bones.   
	And wrongfully this evil wall 
	Denies what all men made for all, 
	And shamelessly this wall surrounds   
	Our homesteads and our native grounds. 
	
	But I will gather and I will ride, 
	And I will summon a countryside, 
	And many a man shall hear my halloa 
	Who never had thought the horn to follow;   
	And many a man shall ride with me 
	Who never had thought on earth to see   
	High Justice in her armoury. 
	
	When we find them where they stand,   
	A mile of men on either hand, 
	I mean to charge from right away 
	And force the flanks of their array, 
	And press them inward from the plains,   
	And drive them clamouring down the lanes,   
	And gallop and harry and have them down,   
	And carry the gates and hold the town.   
	Then shall I rest me from my ride 
	With my great anger satisfied. 
	
	Only, before I eat and drink, 
	When I have killed them all, I think   
	That I will batter their carven names,   
	And slit the pictures in their frames,   
	And burn for scent their cedar door,   
	And melt the gold their women wore,   
	And hack their horses at the knees,   
	And hew to death their timber trees, 
	And plough their gardens deep and through--
	And all these things I mean to do   
	For fear perhaps my little son 
	Should break his hands, as I have done. 



8. THE STATUE

	When we are dead, some Hunting-boy will pass
	And find a stone half-hidden in tall grass
	And grey with age: but having seen that stone
	(Which was your image), ride more slowly on.



9. TARANTELLA

	Do you remember an Inn, 
	Miranda? 
	Do you remember an Inn? 
	And the tedding and the spreading 
	Of the straw for a bedding, 
	And the fleas that tease in the High Pyrenees, 
	And the wine that tasted of tar? 
	And the cheers and the jeers of the young muleteers 
	(Under the vine of the dark veranda)? 
	Do you remember an Inn, Miranda, 
	Do you remember an Inn? 
	And the cheers and the jeers of the young muleteers 
	Who hadn't got a penny, 
	And who weren't paying any, 
	And the hammer at the doors and the din? 
	And the hip! hop! hap! 
	Of the clap 
	Of the hands to the swirl and the twirl 
	Of the girl gone chancing, 
	Glancing, 
	Dancing, 
	Backing and advancing, 
	Snapping of the clapper to the spin 
	Out and in-- 
	And the ting, tong, tang of the guitar! 
	Do you remember an Inn, 
	Miranda? 
	Do you remember an Inn? 
	
	Never more; 
	Miranda, 
	Never more. 
	Only the high peaks hoar; 
	And Aragon a torrent at the door. 
	No sound 
	In the walls of the halls where falls 
	The tread 
	Of the feet of the dead to the ground, 
	No sound: 
	But the boom 
	Of the far waterfall like doom.



10. ON THE GIFT OF A BOOK TO A CHILD

	Child! do not throw this book about!   
	  Refrain from the unholy pleasure   
	Of cutting all the pictures out!
	  Preserve it as your chiefest treasure.
	
	Child, have you never heard it said   
	  That you are heir to all the ages?
	Why, then, your hands were never made
	  To tear these beautiful thick pages!
	
	Your little hands were made to take
	  The better things and leave the worse ones:   
	They also may be used to shake
	  The Massive Paws of Elder Persons.
	
	And when your prayers complete the day,   
	  Darling, your little tiny hands
	Were also made, I think, to pray   
	  For men that lose their fairylands.



11. THE WHALE

	The Whale that wanders round the Pole   
	   Is not a table fish.
	You cannot bake or boil him whole,   
	   Nor serve him in a dish;
	
	But you may cut his blubber up
	   And melt it down for oil,
	And so replace the colza bean
	   (A product of the soil).
	
	These facts should all be noted down   
	   And ruminated on,
	By every boy in Oxford town
	   Who wants to be a Don.



12. THE YAK

	As a friend to the children commend me the Yak.
	You will find it exactly the thing:
	It will carry and fetch, you can ride on its back,
	Or lead it about with a string.
	
	The Tartar who dwells on the plains of Thibet
	(A desolate region of snow)
	Has for centuries made it a nursery pet.
	And surely the Tartar should know!
	
	Then tell your papa where the Yak can be got,
	And if he is awfully rich
	He will buy you the creature--or else he will not.
	(I cannot be positive which.)
