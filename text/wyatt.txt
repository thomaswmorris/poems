*** Thomas Wyatt (1503 - 1542)


1. AND WILT THOU LEAVE ME THUS?

	And wilt thou leave me thus?
	Say nay, say nay, for shame,
	To save thee from the blame
	Of all my grief and grame;
	And wilt thou leave me thus?
	Say nay, say nay!
	
	And wilt thou leave me thus,
	That hath loved thee so long
	In wealth and woe among?
	And is thy heart so strong
	As for to leave me thus?
	Say nay, say nay!
	
	And wilt thou leave me thus,
	That hath given thee my heart
	Never for to depart,
	Nother for pain nor smart;
	And wilt thou leave me thus?
	Say nay, say nay!
	
	And wilt thou leave me thus
	And have no more pity
	Of him that loveth thee?
	Hélas, thy cruelty!
	And wilt thou leave me thus?
	Say nay, say nay!



2. FORGET NOT YET

	Forget not yet the tried intent 
	Of such a truth as I have meant; 
	My great travail so gladly spent, 
	           Forget not yet. 
	
	Forget not yet when first began 
	The weary life ye know, since whan 
	The suit, the service, none tell can; 
	           Forget not yet. 
	
	Forget not yet the great assays, 
	The cruel wrong, the scornful ways; 
	The painful patience in denays, 
	           Forget not yet. 
	
	Forget not yet, forget not this, 
	How long ago hath been and is 
	The mind that never meant amiss; 
	           Forget not yet. 
	
	Forget not then thine own approved, 
	The which so long hath thee so loved, 
	Whose steadfast faith yet never moved; 
	           Forget not this. 



3. I FIND NO PEACE

	I find no peace, and all my war is done.
	I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.
	I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;
	And nought I have, and all the world I seize on.
	That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison
	And holdeth me not--yet can I scape no wise--
	Nor letteth me live nor die at my device,
	And yet of death it giveth me occasion.
	Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.
	I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.
	I love another, and thus I hate myself.
	I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain;
	Likewise displeaseth me both life and death,
	And my delight is causer of this strife.



4. THE LONG LOVE

	The longë love that in my thought doth harbour 
	And in mine hert doth keep his residence, 
	Into my face presseth with bold pretence 
	And therein campeth, spreading his banner. 
	She that me learneth to love and suffer 
	And will that my trust and lustës negligence 
	Be rayned by reason, shame, and reverence, 
	With his hardiness taketh displeasure. 
	Wherewithall unto the hert’s forest he fleeth, 
	Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry, 
	And there him hideth and not appeareth. 
	What may I do when my master feareth 
	But in the field with him to live and die? 
	For good is the life ending faithfully. 



5. THEY FLEE FROM ME

	They flee from me that sometime did me seek
	With naked foot, stalking in my chamber.
	I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek,
	That now are wild and do not remember
	That sometime they put themself in danger
	To take bread at my hand; and now they range,
	Busily seeking with a continual change.
	
	Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise
	Twenty times better; but once in special,
	In thin array after a pleasant guise,
	When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,
	And she me caught in her arms long and small;
	Therewithall sweetly did me kiss
	And softly said, ‘Dear heart, how like you this?’
	
	It was no dream: I lay broad waking.
	But all is turned thorough my gentleness
	Into a strange fashion of forsaking;
	And I have leave to go of her goodness,
	And she also, to use newfangleness.
	But since that I so kindly am served
	I would fain know what she hath deserved.
