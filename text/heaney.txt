*** Seamus Heaney (1939 - 2013)


1. BLACKBERRY-PICKING

	Late August, given heavy rain and sun
	For a full week, the blackberries would ripen.
	At first, just one, a glossy purple clot
	Among others, red, green, hard as a knot.
	You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet
	Like thickened wine: summer’s blood was in it
	Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for
	Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger
	Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots
	Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots.
	Round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drills
	We trekked and picked until the cans were full,
	Until the tinkling bottom had been covered
	With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned
	Like a plate of eyes. Our hands were peppered
	With thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard’s.

	We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre.
	But when the bath was filled we found a fur,
	A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache.
	The juice was stinking too. Once off the bush
	The fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour.
	I always felt like crying. It wasn’t fair
	That all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot.
	Each year I hoped they’d keep, knew they would not.



2. CASUALTY

	I

	He would drink by himself
	And raise a weathered thumb
	Towards the high shelf,
	Calling another rum
	And blackcurrant, without
	Having to raise his voice,
	Or order a quick stout
	By a lifting of the eyes
	And a discreet dumb-show
	Of pulling off the top;
	At closing time would go
	In waders and peaked cap
	Into the showery dark,
	A dole-kept breadwinner
	But a natural for work.
	I loved his whole manner,
	Sure-footed but too sly,
	His deadpan sidling tact,
	His fisherman’s quick eye
	And turned observant back.

	Incomprehensible
	To him, my other life.
	Sometimes, on the high stool,
	Too busy with his knife
	At a tobacco plug
	And not meeting my eye,
	In the pause after a slug
	He mentioned poetry.
	We would be on our own
	And, always politic
	And shy of condescension,
	I would manage by some trick
	To switch the talk to eels
	Or lore of the horse and cart
	Or the Provisionals.

	But my tentative art
	His turned back watches too:
	He was blown to bits
	Out drinking in a curfew
	Others obeyed, three nights
	After they shot dead
	The thirteen men in Derry.
	PARAS THIRTEEN, the walls said,
	BOGSIDE NIL. That Wednesday
	Everyone held
	His breath and trembled.


	II

	It was a day of cold
	Raw silence, wind-blown
	surplice and soutane:
	Rained-on, flower-laden
	Coffin after coffin
	Seemed to float from the door
	Of the packed cathedral
	Like blossoms on slow water.
	The common funeral
	Unrolled its swaddling band,
	Lapping, tightening
	Till we were braced and bound
	Like brothers in a ring.

	But he would not be held
	At home by his own crowd
	Whatever threats were phoned,
	Whatever black flags waved.
	I see him as he turned
	In that bombed offending place,
	Remorse fused with terror
	In his still knowable face,
	His cornered outfaced stare
	Blinding in the flash.

	He had gone miles away
	For he drank like a fish
	Nightly, naturally
	Swimming towards the lure
	Of warm lit-up places,
	The blurred mesh and murmur
	Drifting among glasses
	In the gregarious smoke.
	How culpable was he
	That last night when he broke
	Our tribe’s complicity?
	‘Now, you’re supposed to be
	An educated man,’
	I hear him say. ‘Puzzle me
	The right answer to that one.’


	III

	I missed his funeral,
	Those quiet walkers
	And sideways talkers
	Shoaling out of his lane
	To the respectable
	Purring of the hearse . . .
	They move in equal pace
	With the habitual
	Slow consolation
	Of a dawdling engine,
	The line lifted, hand
	Over fist, cold sunshine
	On the water, the land
	Banked under fog: that morning
	I was taken in his boat,
	The Screw purling, turning
	Indolent fathoms white,
	I tasted freedom with him.
	To get out early, haul
	Steadily off the bottom,
	Dispraise the catch, and smile
	As you find a rhythm
	Working you, slow mile by mile,
	Into your proper haunt
	Somewhere, well out, beyond . . .

	Dawn-sniffing revenant,
	Plodder through midnight rain,
	Question me again.



3. CLEARANCES

	_She taught me what her uncle once taught her:
	How easily the biggest coal block split
	If you got the grain and hammer angled right.

	The sound of that relaxed alluring blow,
	Its co-opted and obliterated echo,
	Taught me to hit, taught me to loosen,

	Taught me between the hammer and the block
	To face the music. Teach me now to listen,
	To strike it rich behind the linear black._


	1

	A cobble thrown a hundred years ago
	Keeps coming at me, the first stone
	Aimed at a great-grandmother’s turncoat brow.
	The pony jerks and the riot’s on.
	She’s crouched low in the trap
	Running the gauntlet that first Sunday
	Down the brae to Mass at a panicked gallop.
	He whips on through the town to cries of ‘Lundy!’

	Call her ‘The Convert’. ‘The Exogamous Bride’.
	Anyhow, it is a genre piece
	Inherited on my mother’s side
	And mine to dispose with now she’s gone.
	Instead of silver and Victorian lace,
	The exonerating, exonerated stone.


	2

	Polished linoleum shone there. Brass taps shone.
	The china cups were very white and big—
	An unchipped set with sugar bowl and jug.
	The kettle whistled. Sandwich and tea scone
	Were present and correct. In case it run,
	The butter must be kept out of the sun.
	And don’t be dropping crumbs. Don’t tilt your chair.
	Don’t reach. Don’t point. Don’t make noise when you stir.

	It is Number 5, New Row, Land of the Dead,
	Where grandfather is rising from his place
	With spectacles pushed back on a clean bald head
	To welcome a bewildered homing daughter
	Before she even knocks. ‘What’s this? What’s this?’
	And they sit down in the shining room together.


	3

	When all the others were away at Mass
	I was all hers as we peeled potatoes.
	They broke the silence, let fall one by one
	Like solder weeping off the soldering iron:
	Cold comforts set between us, things to share
	Gleaming in a bucket of clean water.
	And again let fall. Little pleasant splashes
	From each other’s work would bring us to our senses.

	So while the parish priest at her bedside
	Went hammer and tongs at the prayers for the dying
	And some were responding and some crying
	I remembered her head bent towards my head,
	Her breath in mine, our fluent dipping knives—
	Never closer the whole rest of our lives.


	4

	Fear of affectation made her affect
	Inadequacy whenever it came to
	Pronouncing words ‘beyond her’. Bertold Brek.
	She’d manage something hampered and askew
	Every time, as if she might betray
	The hampered and inadequate by too
	Well-adjusted a vocabulary.
	With more challenge than pride, she’d tell me, ‘You
	Know all them things.’ So I governed my tongue
	In front of her, a genuinely well-
	Adjusted adequate betrayal
	Of what I knew better. I’d naw and aye
	And decently relapse into the wrong
	Grammar which kept us allied and at bay.


	5

	The cool that came off sheets just off the line
	Made me think the damp must still be in them
	But when I took my corners of the linen
	And pulled against her, first straight down the hem
	And then diagonally, then flapped and shook
	The fabric like a sail in a cross-wind,
	They made a dried-out undulating thwack.
	So we’d stretch and fold and end up hand to hand
	For a split second as if nothing had happened
	For nothing had that had not always happened
	Beforehand, day by day, just touch and go,
	Coming close again by holding back
	In moves where I was x and she was o
	Inscribed in sheets she’d sewn from ripped-out flour sacks.


	6

	In the first flush of the Easter holidays
	The ceremonies during Holy Week
	Were highpoints of our Sons and Lovers phase.
	The midnight fire. The paschal candlestick.
	Elbow to elbow, glad to be kneeling next
	To each other up there near the front
	Of the packed church, we would follow the text
	And rubrics for the blessing of the font.
	As the hind longs for the streams, so my soul. . .
	Dippings. Towellings. The water breathed on.
	The water mixed with chrism and with oil.
	Cruet tinkle. Formal incensation
	And the psalmist’s outcry taken up with pride:
	Day and night my tears have been my bread.


	7

	In the last minutes he said more to her
	Almost than in all their life together.
	‘You’ll be in New Row on Monday night
	And I’ll come up for you and you’ll be glad
	When I walk in the door . . . Isn’t that right?’
	His head was bent down to her propped-up head.
	She could not hear but we were overjoyed.
	He called her good and girl. Then she was dead,
	The searching for a pulsebeat was abandoned
	And we all knew one thing by being there.
	The space we stood around had been emptied
	Into us to keep, it penetrated
	Clearances that suddenly stood open.
	High cries were felled and a pure change happened.


	8

	I thought of walking round and round a space
	Utterly empty, utterly a source
	Where the decked chestnut tree had lost its place
	In our front hedge above the wallflowers.
	The white chips jumped and jumped and skited high.
	I heard the hatchet’s differentiated
	Accurate cut, the crack, the sigh
	And collapse of what luxuriated
	Through the shocked tips and wreckage of it all.
	Deep-planted and long gone, my coeval
	Chestnut from a jam jar in a hole,
	Its heft and hush become a bright nowhere,
	A soul ramifying and forever
	Silent, beyond silence listened for.



4. DEATH OF A NATURALIST

	All year the flax-dam festered in the heart
	Of the townland; green and heavy headed
	Flax had rotted there, weighted down by huge sods.
	Daily it sweltered in the punishing sun.
	Bubbles gargled delicately, bluebottles
	Wove a strong gauze of sound around the smell.
	There were dragon-flies, spotted butterflies,
	But best of all was the warm thick slobber
	Of frogspawn that grew like clotted water
	In the shade of the banks. Here, every spring
	I would fill jampotfuls of the jellied
	Specks to range on window-sills at home,
	On shelves at school, and wait and watch until
	The fattening dots burst into nimble--
	Swimming tadpoles. Miss Walls would tell us how
	The daddy frog was called a bullfrog
	And how he croaked and how the mammy frog
	Laid hundreds of little eggs and this was
	Frogspawn. You could tell the weather by frogs too
	For they were yellow in the sun and brown
	In rain.
	Then one hot day when fields were rank
	With cowdung in the grass the angry frogs
	Invaded the flax-dam; I ducked through hedges
	To a coarse croaking that I had not heard
	Before. The air was thick with a bass chorus.
	Right down the dam gross-bellied frogs were cocked
	On sods; their loose necks pulsed like sails. Some hopped:
	The slap and plop were obscene threats. Some sat
	Poised like mud grenades, their blunt heads farting.
	I sickened, turned, and ran. The great slime kings
	Were gathered there for vengeance and I knew
	That if I dipped my hand the spawn would clutch it.



5. FOLLOWER

	My father worked with a horse-plough,
	His shoulders globed like a full sail strung
	Between the shafts and the furrow.
	The horses strained at his clicking tongue.

	An expert. He would set the wing
	And fit the bright steel-pointed sock.
	The sod rolled over without breaking.
	At the headrig, with a single pluck

	Of reins, the sweating team turned round
	And back into the land. His eye
	Narrowed and angled at the ground,
	Mapping the furrow exactly.

	I stumbled in his hobnailed wake,
	Fell sometimes on the polished sod;
	Sometimes he rode me on his back
	Dipping and rising to his plod.

	I wanted to grow up and plough,
	To close one eye, stiffen my arm.
	All I ever did was follow
	In his broad shadow round the farm.

	I was a nuisance, tripping, falling,
	Yapping always. But today
	It is my father who keeps stumbling
	Behind me, and will not go away.



6. THE GRAUBALLE MAN

	As if he had been poured
	in tar, he lies
	on a pillow of turf
	and seems to weep

	the black river of himself.
	The grain of his wrists
	is like bog oak,
	the ball of his heel

	like a basalt egg.
	His instep has shrunk
	cold as a swan’s foot
	or a wet swamp root.

	His hips are the ridge
	and purse of a mussel,
	his spine an eel arrested
	under a glisten of mud.

	The head lifts,
	the chin is a visor
	raised above the vent
	of his slashed throat

	that has tanned and toughened.
	The cured wound
	opens inwards to a dark
	elderberry place.

	Who will say ‘corpse’
	to his vivid cast?
	Who will say ‘body’
	to his opaque repose?

	And his rusted hair,
	a mat unlikely
	as a foetus’s.
	I first saw his twisted face

	in a photograph,
	a head and shoulder
	out of the peat,
	bruised like a forceps baby,

	but now he lies
	perfected in my memory,
	down to the red horn
	of his nails,

	hung in the scales
	with beauty and atrocity:
	with the Dying Gaul
	too strictly compassed

	on his shield,
	with the actual weight
	of each hooded victim,
	slashed and dumped.



7. MAY

	When I looked down from the bridge
	Trout were flipping the sky
	Into smithereens, the stones
	Of the wall warmed me.

	Wading green stems, lugs of leaf
	That untangle and bruise
	(Their tiny gushers of juice)
	My toecaps sparkle now

	Over the soft fontanel
	Of Ireland. I should wear
	Hide shoes, the hair next my skin,
	For walking this ground:

	Wasn’t there a spa-well,
	Its coping grassy, pendent?
	And then the spring issuing
	Right across the tarmac.

	I’m out to find that village,
	Its low sills fragrant
	With lady’s-smock and celandine,
	Marshlights in the summer dark.



8. MID-TERM BREAK

	I sat all morning in the college sick bay
	Counting bells knelling classes to a close.
	At two o’clock our neighbours drove me home.

	In the porch I met my father crying—
	He had always taken funerals in his stride—
	And Big Jim Evans saying it was a hard blow.

	The baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pram
	When I came in, and I was embarrassed
	By old men standing up to shake my hand

	And tell me they were ‘sorry for my trouble’.
	Whispers informed strangers I was the eldest,
	Away at school, as my mother held my hand

	In hers and coughed out angry tearless sighs.
	At ten o’clock the ambulance arrived
	With the corpse, stanched and bandaged by the nurses.

	Next morning I went up into the room. Snowdrops
	And candles soothed the bedside; I saw him
	For the first time in six weeks. Paler now,

	Wearing a poppy bruise on his left temple,
	He lay in the four-foot box as in his cot.
	No gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear.

	A four-foot box, a foot for every year.



9. NORTH

	I returned to a long strand,
	the hammered curve of a bay,
	and found only the secular
	powers of the Atlantic thundering.

	I faced the unmagical
	invitations of Iceland,
	the pathetic colonies
	of Greenland, and suddenly

	those fabulous raiders,
	those lying in Orkney and Dublin
	measured against
	their long swords rusting,

	those in the solid
	belly of stone ships,
	those hacked and glinting
	in the gravel of thawed streams

	were ocean-deafened voices
	warning me, lifted again
	in violence and epiphany.
	The longship’s swimming tongue

	was buoyant with hindsight—
	it said Thor’s hammer swung
	to geography and trade,
	thick-witted couplings and revenges,

	the hatreds and behind-backs
	of the althing, lies and women,
	exhaustions nominated peace,
	memory incubating the spilled blood.

	It said, ‘Lie down
	in the word-hoard, burrow
	the coil and gleam
	of your furrowed brain.

	Compose in darkness.
	Expect aurora borealis
	in the long foray
	but no cascade of light.

	Keep your eye clear
	as the bleb of the icicle,
	trust the feel of what nubbed treasure
	your hands have known.’



10. STRANGE FRUIT

	Here is the girl’s head like an exhumed gourd.
	Oval-faced, prune-skinned, prune-stones for teeth.

	They unswaddled the wet fern of her hair
	And made an exhibition of its coil,
	Let the air at her leathery beauty.
	Pash of tallow, perishable treasure:
	Her broken nose is dark as a turf clod,
	Her eyeholes blank as pools in the old workings.
	Diodorus Siculus confessed
	His gradual ease with the likes of this:
	Murdered, forgotten, nameless, terrible
	Beheaded girl, outstaring axe
	And beatification, outstaring
	What had begun to feel like reverence.
