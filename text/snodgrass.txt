*** W. D. Snodgrass (1926 - 2009)


1. AFTER EXPERIENCE

	After experience taught me that all the ordinary 
	Surroundings of social life are futile and vain; 
	
	I’m going to show you something very 
	Ugly: someday, it might save your life. 
	
	Seeing that none of the things I feared contain 
	In themselves anything either good or bad 
	
	What if you get caught without a knife; 
	Nothing--even a loop of piano wire; 
	
	Excepting only in the effect they had 
	Upon my mind, I resolved to inquire 
	
	Take the first two fingers of this hand; 
	Fork them out--kind of a “V for Victory”--
	
	Whether there might be something whose discovery 
	Would grant me supreme, unending happiness. 
	
	And jam them into the eyes of your enemy. 
	You have to do this hard. Very hard. Then press 
	
	No virtue can be thought to have priority 
	Over this endeavor to preserve one’s being. 
	
	Both fingers down around the cheekbone 
	And setting your foot high into the chest 
	
	No man can desire to act rightly, to be blessed, 
	To live rightly, without simultaneously 
	
	You must call up every strength you own 
	And you can rip off the whole facial mask. 
	
	Wishing to be, to act, to live. He must ask 
	First, in other words, to actually exist. 
	
	
	And you, whiner, who wastes your time 
	Dawdling over the remorseless earth, 
	What evil, what unspeakable crime 
	Have you made your life worth?


2. APRIL INVENTORY

	The green catalpa tree has turned 
	All white; the cherry blooms once more. 
	In one whole year I haven’t learned 
	A blessed thing they pay you for. 
	The blossoms snow down in my hair; 
	The trees and I will soon be bare. 
	
	The trees have more than I to spare. 
	The sleek, expensive girls I teach, 
	Younger and pinker every year, 
	Bloom gradually out of reach. 
	The pear tree lets its petals drop 
	Like dandruff on a tabletop. 
	
	The girls have grown so young by now 
	I have to nudge myself to stare. 
	This year they smile and mind me how 
	My teeth are falling with my hair. 
	In thirty years I may not get 
	Younger, shrewder, or out of debt. 
	
	The tenth time, just a year ago, 
	I made myself a little list 
	Of all the things I’d ought to know, 
	Then told my parents, analyst, 
	And everyone who’s trusted me 
	I’d be substantial, presently. 
	
	I haven’t read one book about 
	A book or memorized one plot. 
	Or found a mind I did not doubt. 
	I learned one date.And then forgot. 
	And one by one the solid scholars 
	Get the degrees, the jobs, the dollars. 
	
	And smile above their starchy collars. 
	I taught my classes Whitehead’s notions; 
	One lovely girl, a song of Mahler’s. 
	Lacking a source-book or promotions, 
	I showed one child the colors of 
	A luna moth and how to love. 
	
	I taught myself to name my name, 
	To bark back, loosen love and crying; 
	To ease my woman so she came, 
	To ease an old man who was dying. 
	I have not learned how often I 
	Can win, can love, but choose to die. 
	
	I have not learned there is a lie 
	Love shall be blonder, slimmer, younger; 
	That my equivocating eye 
	Loves only by my body’s hunger; 
	That I have forces true to feel, 
	Or that the lovely world is real. 
	
	While scholars speak authority 
	And wear their ulcers on their sleeves, 
	My eyes in spectacles shall see 
	These trees procure and spend their leaves. 
	There is a value underneath 
	The gold and silver in my teeth. 
	
	Though trees turn bare and girls turn wives, 
	We shall afford our costly seasons; 
	There is a gentleness survives 
	That will outspeak and has its reasons. 
	There is a loveliness exists, 
	Preserves us, not for specialists.


3. AS A CHILD, SLEEPLESS

	The ’possum under the owl’s claw,
	The wet fawn huddled in the grass,
	The soldier, hurt, in his lost trench
	Clench the eyelid, clutch the breath
	Till scavengers, till _coup de grâce_,
	Death and the lurking terror pass.
	
	Vice tight each muscle lest the pent
	Tendon spasm, twitch; preserve
	All rigor, silence, so the blood
	Thuds slower, fainter through the vein
	Till the chilled skin gives off no scent;
	Drain all least current from the nerve.
	
	Clamp the arm tight against the head
	To hush that whisper in the nose,
	The click if lips slip open. Cover
	Over this face and form; disguise
	Whose body’s lying on the bed,
	Eyes that still stare too wide to close.


4. AUTUMN VARIATIONS

	I
	
	The evening grosbeak on the lawn
	Will turn his back on us, move on
	With his wide family and those friends
	We thought were ours. That’s how it ends.
	If it’s been good, be glad it’s been;
	It won’t be. The cold shoulder’s in
	We must make do, once summer’s done,
	With our fair-weather friends or none.
	
	
	II
	
	The garden’s garter snake,
	the warty toad in our garage
	don’t get around these days.
	Woodchuck and rabbit sink
	into themselves; if they
	have some idea, who’s to say?
	The few birds left accept
	the mob opinions
	and the fashions: a dull
	
	
	III 
	
	Stalinist grey that will
	offend no one. The turtles
	turn tail on the pond, withdraw
	to meditate, regroup or,
	joining what’s too big to beat,
	dig down in the numb
	security of clay, one
	with their fate.
	In spray-paint, psychedelic, gaudy,
	Fall scrawls its name--a blunt and bawdy
	Challenge to the complacent wood.
	We say: there goes the neighborhood;
	It is not and it cannot come to good.
	Soon, flustered leaves will sag like torn
	Wallpaper; solid dark walls, worn
	Through here and there, expose a bitter
	Sky while, on the bare ground, litter
	And stub ends pile up everywhere.
	Not even one green plant would dare
	Poke its nose out in that crude air
	Of catch-as-catch-can thievery, lust,
	Cut-throat protection and sick trust.
	Where year by year we walked together
	Determined paths, a wilder atmosphere
	Wheels in, flaunting its chains, blades and black leather.
	
	
	IV
	
	Imperial greenery withdraws,
	flamboyant and corrupt; the leaf’s
	far government’s lost
	faith in its mission, that certainty
	to be despotic and
	victorious. Now failure’s
	certain, a certain
	mercy enters in; such as
	it is, the sun
	gets spread around, the magnanimity
	of the poor. Only some pines,
	hard-needled loyalists, cling
	to their colors and won’t change. Dark,
	under those implacable branches,
	nothing grows.
	
	
	V
	
	Maple and ash in the hedgerow
	Figure the green light’s gone and go
	To a flat brown. The white-tailed deer
	Must know what’s up; they disappear
	Like high ideals. Across the field,
	Mallows and black-eyed Susans yield
	To the solicitude of tractor
	And combine, like a trash compactor
	Crushing the summer’s shapes and scents-
	Leaf, stem and petal-into dense
	Blocks scattered like packed bags and crates
	Around the field while the field waits.
	
	
	VI
	
	Sharp, black crickets
	have got the house
	surrounded; miners and sappers
	gnaw our siding;
	buckwheat flies, wasps
	and spiders--spies-
	thread the cellar and the walls.
	And these are the deserters
	who’ve lost the front
	outside. Put on fat;
	put on fur; the windows
	rattle. The only news
	says we’ll know soon
	what sort of man you are.
	
	
	VII
	
	Bark strips peel off the sycamore
	Like weathered clapboards. The wind’s war
	Moves up closer. Our woodlot’s floor
	Fills up with wreckage like a village
	Fought and recaptured. Ripe for pillage,
	Berries and haws shine down a street
	Where the racoon and field mouse beat
	A long, inglorious retreat.
	
	
	VIII
	
	Bare bones! bare bones!
	is the wind’s suggestion
	and, one by one, leaves,
	like bright embroidery
	rinsed in bleach or like
	words in the brain’s skein,
	the tree of memory,
	are gone. All sweet details
	pass on in
	“the abstraction
	of old age”: skeletal
	trunk and branchings, lacy
	tracework of each leaf,
	medulla and the neural reach
	of those ways we once knew
	things we forget
	under the soft, featureless
	democracy of snow.


5. THE CAMPUS ON THE HILL

	Up the reputable walks of old established trees
	They stalk, children of the _nouveaux riches_; chimes
	Of the tall Clock Tower drench their heads in blessing:   
	“I don’t wanna play at your house;
	I don’t like you any more.”
	My house stands opposite, on the other hill,
	Among meadows, with the orchard fences down and falling;   
	Deer come almost to the door.
	You cannot see it, even in this clearest morning.
	White birds hang in the air between
	Over the garbage landfill and those homes thereto adjacent,   
	Hovering slowly, turning, settling down
	Like the flakes sifting imperceptibly onto the little town   
	In a waterball of glass.
	And yet, this morning, beyond this quiet scene,
	The floating birds, the backyards of the poor,
	Beyond the shopping plaza, the dead canal, the hillside lying tilted in the air,
	
	Tomorrow has broken out today:
	Riot in Algeria, in Cyprus, in Alabama;
	Aged in wrong, the empires are declining,
	And China gathers, soundlessly, like evidence.
	What shall I say to the young on such a morning?--
	Mind is the one salvation?--also grammar?--
	No; my little ones lean not toward revolt. They
	Are the Whites, the vaguely furiously driven, who resist   
	Their souls with such passivity
	As would make Quakers swear. All day, dear Lord, all day   
	They wear their godhead lightly.
	They look out from their hill and say,
	To themselves, “We have nowhere to go but down;   
	The great destination is to stay.”
	Surely the nations will be reasonable;
	They look at the world--don’t they?--the world’s way?   
	The clock just now has nothing more to say.


6. DR. JOSEPH GOEBBELS

	_(On this date, Goebbels moved into the lowest level of the bunker, taking a room opposite Hitler’s.)_
	
	Stand back, make way, you mindless scum,   
	Squire Voland the Seducer’s come--
	Old Bock from Babelsberg whose tower   
	Falls silent now, whose shrunken power   
	For lies or lays comes hobbling home   
	Into this concrete catacomb.
	
	Here’s Runty Joe, the cunt collector   
	Who grew to greatness, first erector   
	Of myths and missions, fibs and fables,
	Who pulled the wool then turned the tables:   
	He piped the tunes and called the dance   
	Where shirtless countries lost their pants.
	
	Goatfooted Pan, the nation’s gander
	To whom Pan-Germans all played pander,   
	The jovial cob-swan quick to cover   
	Lida Baarova, his check-list lover;   
	Swellfoot the Tyrant, he could riddle   
	Men’s minds away, hi-diddle-diddle.
	
	Our little Doctor, Joe the Gimp   
	Comes back to limpness and his limp:   
	Hephaistos, Vulcan the lame smith   
	Whose net of lies caught one true myth:   
	His wife, the famous beauty, whored   
	By numbskull Mars, the dull warlord.
	
	What if I took my little fling   
	At conquest, at adventuring.
	Pried the lid of Pandora’s box off--
	There’s nothing there to bring your rocks off.   
	I never saw one fucking day   
	So fine I courted it to stay.
	
	If I got snarled in my own mesh
	Of thighs and bellies, who wants flesh?   
	I never hankered after matter.
	Let Hermann swell up, grosser, fatter,   
	Weighed down by medals, houses, clothing;   
	They leave me lean, secured in loathing.
	
	As a young man, I pricked the bubble   
	Of every creed; I saw that rubble
	And offered myself the realms of earth   
	Just to say Yes. But what’s it worth?   
	No thank you, Ma’am. Behold the Ram   
	Of God: I doubt, therefore I am.
	
	Here I forsake that long pricktease   
	Of histories, hopes, lusts, luxuries.   
	I come back to my first Ideal--
	The vacancy that’s always real.   
	I sniffed out all life’s openings:   
	I loved only the holes in things.
	
	So strip down one bare cell for this   
	Lay Brother of the last abyss.
	To me, still, all abstractions smell;   
	My head and nose clear in this cell   
	Of concrete, this confession booth   
	Where liars face up to blank truth.
	
	My tongue lashed millions to the knife;   
	Here, I’ll hold hands with my soiled wife.   
	My lies piped men out, hot to slaughter;   
	Here, I’ll read stories to my daughter   
	Then hack off all relations, choose   
	Only the Nothing you can’t lose,
	
	Send back this body, fixed in its   
	Infantile paralysis.
	I was born small; I shall grow less   
	Till I burst into Nothingness,
	That slot in time where only pure   
	Spirit extends, absent and sure.
	
	I am that spirit that denies,
	High Priest of Laymen, Prince of Lies.   
	Your house is founded on my rock;   
	Truth crows; now I deny my cock.   
	Jock of this walk, I turn down all,   
	Robbing my Peter to play Paul.
	
	I give up all goods I possess
	To build my faith on faithlessness.
	Black Peter, I belie my Lord--
	You’ve got to die to spread the Word.   
	Now the last act; there’s no sequel.
	Soon, once more, all things shall be equal.


7. A FLAT ONE

	      Old Fritz, on this rotating bed
	      For seven wasted months you lay
	      Unfit to move, shrunken, gray,
	      No good to yourself or anyone
	But to be babied--changed and bathed and fed.
	            At long last, that’s all done.
	
	      Before each meal, twice every night,
	      We set pads on your bedsores, shut
	      Your catheter tube off, then brought
	      The second canvas-and-black-iron
	Bedframe and clamped you in between them, tight,
	            Scared, so we could turn
	
	      You over. We washed you, covered you,
	      Cut up each bite of meat you ate;
	      We watched your lean jaws masticate
	      As ravenously your useless food
	As thieves at hard labor in their chains chew
	            Or insects in the wood.
	
	      Such pious sacrifice to give
	      You all you could demand of pain:
	      Receive this haddock’s body slain
	      For you, old tyrant; take this blood
	Of a tomato, shed that you might live.
	            You had that costly food.
	
	      You seem to be all finished, so
	      We’ll plug your old recalcitrant anus
	      And tie up your discouraged penis
	      In a great, snow-white bow of gauze.
	We wrap you, pin you, and cart you down below,
	            Below, below, because
	
	      Your credit has finally run out.
	      On our steel table, trussed and carved,
	      You’ll find this world’s hardworking, starved
	      Teeth working in your precious skin.
	The earth turns, in the end, by turn about
	             And opens to take you in.
	
	      Seven months gone down the drain; thank God
	      That’s through. Throw out the four-by-fours,
	      Swabsticks, the thick salve for bedsores,
	      Throw out the diaper pads and drug
	Containers, pile the bedclothes in a wad,
	            And rinse the cider jug
	
	      Half-filled with the last urine. Then
	      Empty out the cotton cans,
	      Autoclave the bowls and spit pans,
	      Unhook the pumps and all the red
	Tubes--catheter, suction, oxygen;
	            Next, wash the empty bed.
	
	      --All this Dark Age machinery
	      On which we had tormented you
	      To life. Last, we collect the few
	      Belongings: snapshots, some odd bills,
	Your mail, and half a pack of Luckies we
	            Won’t light you after meals.
	
	      Old man, these seven months you’ve lain
	      Determined--not that you would live--
	      Just to not die. No one would give
	      You one chance you could ever wake
	From that first night, much less go well again,
	            Much less go home and make
	
	      Your living; how could you hope to find
	      A place for yourself in all creation?--
	      Pain was your only occupation.
	      And pain what should content and will
	A man to give it up, nerved you to grind
	            Your clenched teeth, breathing, till
	
	      Your skin broke down, your calves went flat
	      And your legs lost all sensation. Still,
	      You took enough morphine to kill
	      A strong man. Finally, nitrogen
	Mustard: you could last two months after that;
	            It would kill you then.
	
	      Even then you wouldn’t quit.
	      Old soldier, yet you must have known
	      Inside the animal had grown
	      Sick of the world, made up its mind
	To stop. Your mind ground on its separate
	            Way, merciless and blind,
	
	      Into these last weeks when the breath
	      Would only come in fits and starts
	      That puffed out your sections like the parts
	      Of some enormous, damaged bug.
	You waited, not for life, not for your death,
	            Just for the deadening drug
	
	      That made your life seem bearable.
	      You still whispered you would not die.
	      Yet the nights I heard you cry
	      Like a whipped child; in fierce old age
	You whimpered, tears stood on your gun-metal
	            Blue cheeks shaking with rage
	
	      And terror. So much pain would fill
	      Your room that when I left I’d pray
	      That if I came back the next day
	      I’d find you gone. You stayed for me--
	Nailed to your own rapacious, stiff self-will.
	            You’ve shook loose, finally.
	
	      They say this was a worthwhile job
	      Unless they tried it. It is mad
	      To throw our good lives after bad;
	      Waste time, drugs, and our minds, while strong
	Men starve. How many young men did we rob
	            To keep you hanging on?
	
	      I can’t think we did you much good.
	      Well, when you died, none of us wept.
	      You killed for us, and so we kept
	      You, because we need to earn our pay.
	No. We’d still have to help you try. We would
	            Have killed for you today.


8. HEART’S NEEDLE

	_When he would not return to fine garments and good food, to his houses and his people, Loingseachan told him, “Your father is dead.” “I’m sorry to hear it,” he said. “Your mother is dead,” said the lad. “All pity for me has gone out of the world.” “Your sister, too, is dead.” “The mild sun rests on every ditch,” he said; “a sister loves even though not loved.” “Suibhne, your daughter is dead.” “And an only daughter is the needle of the heart.” “And Suibhne, your little boy, who used to call you “Daddy”--he is dead.” “Aye,” said Suibhne, “that’s the drop that brings a man to the ground.”_
	_He fell out of the yew tree; Loingseachan closed his arms around him and placed him in manacles._
	    --After the Middle-Irish Romance, The Madness of Suibhne
	
	
	1
	
	Child of my winter, born
	When the new fallen soldiers froze
	In Asia’s steep ravines and fouled the snows,   
	When I was torn
	
	By love I could not still,
	By fear that silenced my cramped mind
	To that cold war where, lost, I could not find   
	My peace in my will,
	
	All those days we could keep
	Your mind a landscape of new snow
	Where the chilled tenant-farmer finds, below,   
	His fields asleep
	
	In their smooth covering, white
	As quilts to warm the resting bed
	Of birth or pain, spotless as paper spread   
	For me to write,
	
	And thinks: Here lies my land
	Unmarked by agony, the lean foot
	Of the weasel tracking, the thick trapper’s boot;   
	And I have planned
	
	My chances to restrain
	The torments of demented summer or   
	Increase the deepening harvest here before   
	It snows again.
	
	
	2
	
	    Late April and you are three; today
	         We dug your garden in the yard.
	    To curb the damage of your play,
	Strange dogs at night and the moles tunneling,   
	    Four slender sticks of lath stand guard   
	         Uplifting their thin string.
	
	    So you were the first to tramp it down.
	         And after the earth was sifted close   
	    You brought your watering can to drown
	All earth and us. But these mixed seeds are pressed   
	    With light loam in their steadfast rows.
	         Child, we’ve done our best.
	
	    Someone will have to weed and spread
	         The young sprouts. Sprinkle them in the hour   
	    When shadow falls across their bed.
	You should try to look at them every day   
	    Because when they come to full flower
	         I will be away.
	
	
	3
	
	The child between them on the street   
	Comes to a puddle, lifts his feet
	    And hangs on their hands. They start   
	At the live weight and lurch together,   
	Recoil to swing him through the weather,
	    Stiffen and pull apart.
	
	We read of cold war soldiers that
	Never gained ground, gave none, but sat   
	    Tight in their chill trenches.
	Pain seeps up from some cavity
	Through the ranked teeth in sympathy;   
	    The whole jaw grinds and clenches
	
	Till something somewhere has to give.   
	It’s better the poor soldiers live
	    In someone else’s hands
	Than drop where helpless powers fall   
	On crops and barns, on towns where all   
	    Will burn. And no man stands.
	
	For good, they sever and divide
	Their won and lost land. On each side   
	    Prisoners are returned
	Excepting a few unknown names.   
	The peasant plods back and reclaims   
	    His fields that strangers burned
	
	And nobody seems very pleased.
	It’s best. Still, what must not be seized   
	    Clenches the empty fist.
	I tugged your hand, once, when I hated   
	Things less: a mere game dislocated   
	    The radius of your wrist.
	
	Love’s wishbone, child, although I’ve gone   
	As men must and let you be drawn   
	    Off to appease another,
	It may help that a Chinese play
	Or Solomon himself might say
	    I am your real mother.
	
	
	4
	
	         No one can tell you why   
	    the season will not wait;
	         the night I told you I
	must leave, you wept a fearful rate   
	             to stay up late.
	
	         Now that it’s turning Fall,   
	    we go to take our walk
	         among municipal
	flowers, to steal one off its stalk,   
	             to try and talk.
	
	         We huff like windy giants
	    scattering with our breath   
	         gray-headed dandelions;
	Spring is the cold wind’s aftermath.
	             The poet saith.
	
	         But the asters, too, are gray,
	    ghost-gray. Last night’s cold   
	         is sending on their way
	petunias and dwarf marigold,
	             hunched sick and old.
	
	         Like nerves caught in a graph,   
	    the morning-glory vines
	         frost has erased by half
	still scrawl across their rigid twines.   
	             Like broken lines
	
	         of verses I can’t make.
	    In its unraveling loom
	         we find a flower to take,
	with some late buds that might still bloom,   
	             back to your room.
	
	         Night comes and the stiff dew.   
	    I’m told a friend’s child cried   
	         because a cricket, who
	had minstreled every night outside   
	             her window, died.
	
	
	5
	
	Winter again and it is snowing;   
	Although you are still three,   
	You are already growing
	Strange to me.
	
	You chatter about new playmates, sing   
	Strange songs; you do not know   
	Hey ding-a-ding-a-ding 
	Or where I go
	
	Or when I sang for bedtime, Fox
	Went out on a chilly night,
	Before I went for walks
	And did not write;
	
	You never mind the squalls and storms   
	That are renewed long since;
	Outside the thick snow swarms
	Into my prints
	
	And swirls out by warehouses, sealed,   
	Dark cowbarns, huddled, still,
	Beyond to the blank field,
	The fox’s hill
	
	Where he backtracks and sees the paw,   
	Gnawed off, he cannot feel;
	Conceded to the jaw
	Of toothed, blue steel.
	
	
	6
	
	         Easter has come around
	    again; the river is rising
	         over the thawed ground
	    and the banksides. When you come you bring   
	         an egg dyed lavender.
	    We shout along our bank to hear
	our voices returning from the hills to meet us.   
	    We need the landscape to repeat us.
	
	         You lived on this bank first.
	    While nine months filled your term, we knew
	         how your lungs, immersed
	    in the womb, miraculously grew
	         their useless folds till
	    the fierce, cold air rushed in to fill
	them out like bushes thick with leaves. You took your hour,   
	    caught breath, and cried with your full lung power.
	
	         Over the stagnant bight
	    we see the hungry bank swallow
	         flaunting his free flight
	    still; we sink in mud to follow
	         the killdeer from the grass
	    that hides her nest. That March there was
	rain; the rivers rose; you could hear killdeers flying   
	    all night over the mudflats crying.
	
	         You bring back how the red-
	    winged blackbird shrieked, slapping frail wings,   
	         diving at my head--
	    I saw where her tough nest, cradled, swings   
	         in tall reeds that must sway
	    with the winds blowing every way.
	If you recall much, you recall this place. You still   
	    live nearby--on the opposite hill.
	
	         After the sharp windstorm
	    of July Fourth, all that summer
	         through the gentle, warm
	    afternoons, we heard great chain saws chirr
	         like iron locusts. Crews
	    of roughneck boys swarmed to cut loose
	branches wrenched in the shattering wind, to hack free   
	    all the torn limbs that could sap the tree.
	
	         In the debris lay
	    starlings, dead. Near the park’s birdrun
	         we surprised one day
	    a proud, tan-spatted, buff-brown pigeon.
	         In my hands she flapped so
	    fearfully that I let her go.
	Her keeper came. And we helped snarl her in a net.   
	    You bring things I’d as soon forget.
	
	         You raise into my head
	    a Fall night that I came once more
	         to sit on your bed;
	    sweat beads stood out on your arms and fore-
	         head and you wheezed for breath,
	    for help, like some child caught beneath
	its comfortable woolly blankets, drowning there.   
	    Your lungs caught and would not take the air.
	
	         Of all things, only we
	    have power to choose that we should die;   
	             nothing else is free
	    in this world to refuse it. Yet I,
	         who say this, could not raise   
	    myself from bed how many days
	to the thieving world. Child, I have another wife,   
	    another child. We try to choose our life.
	
	
	7
	
	Here in the scuffled dust
	    is our ground of play.
	I lift you on your swing and must   
	    shove you away,
	see you return again,
	    drive you off again, then
	
	stand quiet till you come.
	    You, though you climb   
	higher, farther from me, longer,
	    will fall back to me stronger.   
	Bad penny, pendulum,
	    you keep my constant time
	
	to bob in blue July
	    where fat goldfinches fly
	over the glittering, fecund   
	    reach of our growing lands.
	Once more now, this second,
	    I hold you in my hands.
	
	
	8
	
	I thumped on you the best I could   
	         which was no use;
	you would not tolerate your food   
	until the sweet, fresh milk was soured   
	         with lemon juice.
	
	That puffed you up like a fine yeast.
	    The first June in your yard
	like some squat Nero at a feast
	you sat and chewed on white, sweet clover.   
	         That is over.
	
	When you were old enough to walk   
	         we went to feed
	the rabbits in the park milkweed;   
	saw the paired monkeys, under lock,   
	    consume each other’s salt.
	
	Going home we watched the slow   
	stars follow us down Heaven’s vault.
	You said, let’s catch one that comes low,
	         pull off its skin
	    and cook it for our dinner.
	
	    As absentee bread-winner,
	I seldom got you such cuisine;
	we ate in local restaurants
	or bought what lunches we could pack   
	         in a brown sack
	
	with stale, dry bread to toss for ducks   
	    on the green-scummed lagoons,   
	crackers for porcupine and fox,
	life-savers for the footpad coons   
	         to scour and rinse,
	
	snatch after in their muddy pail   
	
	    and stare into their paws.
	When I moved next door to the jail   
	         I learned to fry
	omelettes and griddlecakes so I
	
	could set you supper at my table.   
	As I built back from helplessness,   
	         when I grew able,
	the only possible answer was   
	    you had to come here less.
	
	This Hallowe’en you come one week.   
	         You masquerade
	    as a vermilion, sleek,
	fat, crosseyed fox in the parade   
	or, where grim jackolanterns leer,
	
	go with your bag from door to door   
	foraging for treats. How queer:
	    when you take off your mask
	my neighbors must forget and ask
	         whose child you are.
	
	Of course you lose your appetite,   
	    whine and won’t touch your plate;   
	         as local law
	I set your place on an orange crate   
	in your own room for days. At night
	
	you lie asleep there on the bed   
	         and grate your jaw.
	Assuredly your father’s crimes   
	         are visited
	on you. You visit me sometimes.
	
	The time’s up. Now our pumpkin sees   
	    me bringing your suitcase.
	         He holds his grin;
	the forehead shrivels, sinking in.
	You break this year’s first crust of snow
	
	off the runningboard to eat.
	    We manage, though for days
	I crave sweets when you leave and know   
	they rot my teeth. Indeed our sweet
	         foods leave us cavities.
	
	
	9
	
	    I get numb and go in
	though the dry ground will not hold
	    the few dry swirls of snow   
	and it must not be very cold.   
	A friend asks how you’ve been
	         and I don’t know
	
	    or see much right to ask.
	Or what use it could be to know.
	    In three months since you came   
	the leaves have fallen and the snow;   
	your pictures pinned above my desk
	         seem much the same.
	
	    Somehow I come to find
	myself upstairs in the third floor   
	    museum’s halls,
	walking to kill my time once more   
	among the enduring and resigned   
	         stuffed animals,
	
	    where, through a century’s
	caprice, displacement and
	    known treachery between
	its wars, they hear some old command   
	and in their peaceable kingdoms freeze   
	         to this still scene,
	
	    Nature Morte. Here
	by the door, its guardian,
	    the patchwork dodo stands
	where you and your stepsister ran   
	laughing and pointing. Here, last year,   
	         you pulled my hands
	
	    and had your first, worst quarrel,   
	so toys were put up on your shelves.   
	    Here in the first glass cage
	the little bobcats arch themselves,   
	still practicing their snarl
	         of constant rage.
	
	    The bison, here, immense,   
	shoves at his calf, brow to brow,   
	    and looks it in the eye
	to see what is it thinking now.   
	I forced you to obedience;
	         I don’t know why.
	
	    Still the lean lioness
	beyond them, on her jutting ledge   
	    of shale and desert shrub,
	stands watching always at the edge,   
	stands hard and tanned and envious   
	         above her cub;
	
	    with horns locked in tall heather,   
	two great Olympian Elk stand bound,   
	    fixed in their lasting hate
	till hunger brings them both to ground.   
	Whom equal weakness binds together   
	    none shall separate.
	
	    Yet separate in the ocean
	of broken ice, the white bear reels
	    beyond the leathery groups   
	of scattered, drab Arctic seals   
	arrested here in violent motion
	    like Napoleon’s troops.
	
	    Our states have stood so long
	at war, shaken with hate and dread,   
	    they are paralyzed at bay;
	once we were out of reach, we said,   
	we would grow reasonable and strong.   
	         Some other day.
	
	    Like the cold men of Rome,
	we have won costly fields to sow
	    in salt, our only seed.   
	Nothing but injury will grow.
	I write you only the bitter poems
	         that you can’t read.
	
	    Onan who would not breed
	a child to take his brother’s bread   
	    and be his brother’s birth,
	rose up and left his lawful bed,   
	went out and spilled his seed   
	         in the cold earth.
	
	    I stand by the unborn,
	by putty-colored children curled
	    in jars of alcohol,
	that waken to no other world,   
	unchanging, where no eye shall mourn.   
	         I see the caul
	
	    that wrapped a kitten, dead.
	I see the branching, doubled throat   
	    of a two-headed foal;
	I see the hydrocephalic goat;
	here is the curled and swollen head,   
	         there, the burst skull;
	
	    skin of a limbless calf;
	a horse’s foetus, mummified;
	    mounted and joined forever,   
	the Siamese twin dogs that ride   
	belly to belly, half and half,
	         that none shall sever.
	
	    I walk among the growths,
	by gangrenous tissue, goiter, cysts,   
	    by fistulas and cancers,
	where the malignancy man loathes   
	is held suspended and persists.
	         And I don’t know the answers.
	
	    The window’s turning white.
	The world moves like a diseased heart   
	    packed with ice and snow.
	Three months now we have been apart   
	less than a mile. I cannot fight
	         or let you go.
	
	
	10
	
	The vicious winter finally yields   
	    the green winter wheat;
	the farmer, tired in the tired fields   
	    he dare not leave, will eat.
	
	Once more the runs come fresh; prevailing   
	    piglets, stout as jugs,
	harry their old sow to the railing
	    to ease her swollen dugs
	
	and game colts trail the herded mares
	    that circle the pasture courses;   
	our seasons bring us back once more
	    like merry-go-round horses.
	
	With crocus mouths, perennial hungers,   
	    into the park Spring comes;
	we roast hot dogs on old coat hangers
	    and feed the swan bread crumbs,
	
	pay our respects to the peacocks, rabbits,   
	    and leathery Canada goose
	who took, last Fall, our tame white habits   
	    and now will not turn loose.
	
	In full regalia, the pheasant cocks
	    march past their dubious hens;
	the porcupine and the lean, red fox
	    trot around bachelor pens
	
	and the miniature painted train   
	    wails on its oval track:
	you said, I’m going to Pennsylvania!   
	    and waved. And you’ve come back.
	
	If I loved you, they said I’d leave   
	    and find my own affairs.
	Well, once again this April, we’ve   
	    come around to the bears;
	
	punished and cared for, behind bars,
	    the coons on bread and water
	stretch thin black fingers after ours.
	    And you are still my daughter.


9. INVITATION

	Come live with me and be my last
	Resource, location and resort,
	My workday’s focus and steadfast
	Distraction to a weekend’s sport.
	Come end up with me, close my list;
	Blank my black book, block every e-mail
	From ex-loves whose mouths won’t be missed;
	Let nothing else alive look female.
	Come couch with me mit Freud und Lust
	As every evening’s last connection.
	Talk to me; prove the day like Proust;
	Let what comes next rise to inspection.
	Come, let old aftermaths get lost,
	Let failures and betrayals mend,
	Cancel repayments; clear the cost;
	Once more unto the breach, dear friend.
	Come lay us down to sleep at least,
	Sharing this pillow’s picture show.
	Who’s been my braintrust and best beast?
	Who else knows what I need to know?


10. LASTING

	“Fish oils,” my doctor snorted, “and oily fish
	are actually good for you. What’s actually wrong
	for anyone your age are all those dishes
	with thick sauce that we all pined for so long
	as we were young and poor. Now we can afford
	to order such things, just not to digest them;
	we find what bills we’ve run up in the stored
	plaque and fat cells of our next stress test.”
	
	My own last test scored in the top 10 percent
	of males in my age bracket. Which defies
	all consequences or justice--I’ve spent
	years shackled to my desk, saved from all exercise.
	My dentist, next: “Your teeth seem quite good
	for someone your age, better than we’d expect
	with so few checkups or cleanings. Teeth should
	repay you with more grief for such neglect”--
	
	echoing how my mother always nagged,
	“Brush a full 100 strokes,” and would jam
	cod liver oil down our throats till we’d go gagging
	off to flu-filled classrooms, crammed
	with vegetables and vitamins. By now,
	I’ve outlasted both parents whose plain food
	and firm ordinance must have endowed
	this heart’s tough muscle--weak still in gratitude.


11. LOBSTER IN THE WINDOW

	First, you think they are dead. 
	Then you are almost sure 
	One is beginning to stir. 
	Out of the crushed ice, slow 
	As the hands of a schoolroom clock, 
	He lifts his one great claw 
	And holds it over his head; 
	Now, he is trying to walk.
	
	But like a run-down toy; 
	Like the backward crabs we boys 
	Splashed after in the creek, 
	Trapped in jars or a net, 
	And then took home to keep. 
	Overgrown, retarded, weak, 
	He is fumbling yet 
	From the deep chill of his sleep
	
	As if, in a glacial thaw, 
	Some ancient thing might wake 
	Sore and cold and stiff 
	Struggling to raise one claw 
	Like a defiant fist; 
	Yet wavering, as if 
	Starting to swell and ache 
	With that thick peg in the wrist.
	
	I should wave back, I guess. 
	But still in his permanent clench 
	He’s fallen back with the mass 
	Heaped in their common trench 
	Who stir, but do not look out 
	Through the rainstreaming glass, 
	Hear what the newsboys shout, 
	Or see the raincoats pass.


12. A LOCKED HOUSE

	As we drove back, crossing the hill, 
	The house still 
	Hidden in the trees, I always thought--
	A fool’s fear--that it might have caught 
	Fire, someone could have broken in. 
	As if things must have been 
	Too good here. Still, we always found 
	It locked tight, safe and sound. 
	
	I mentioned that, once, as a joke; 
	No doubt we spoke 
	Of the absurdity 
	To fear some dour god’s jealousy 
	Of our good fortune. From the farm 
	Next door, our neighbors saw no harm 
	Came to the things we cared for here. 
	What did we have to fear? 
	
	Maybe I should have thought: all 
	Such things rot, fall--
	Barns, houses, furniture. 
	We two are stronger than we were 
	Apart; we’ve grown 
	Together. Everything we own 
	Can burn; we know what counts--some such 
	Idea. We said as much. 
	
	We’d watched friends driven to betray; 
	Felt that love drained away 
	Some self they need. 
	We’d said love, like a growth, can feed 
	On hate we turn in and disguise; 
	We warned ourselves. That you might despise 
	Me--hate all we both loved best--
	None of us ever guessed. 
	
	The house still stands, locked, as it stood 
	Untouched a good 
	Two years after you went. 
	Some things passed in the settlement; 
	Some things slipped away. Enough’s left 
	That I come back sometimes. The theft 
	And vandalism were our own. 
	Maybe we should have known.


13. LYING AWAKE

	This moth caught in the room tonight
	Squirmed up, sniper-style, between
	The rusty edges of the screen;
	Then, long as the room stayed light,
	 
	Lay here, content, in some cornerhole.
	Now that we’ve settled into bed
	Though, he can’t sleep. Overhead,
	he hurls himself at the blank wall.
	 
	Each night hordes of these flutterers haunt
	And climb my study windowpane;
	Fired by reflection, their insane
	Eyes gleam; they know what they want.
	 
	How do the petulant things survive?
	Out in the fields they have a place
	And proper work, furthering the race;
	Why this blind fanatical drive
	 
	Indoors? Why rush at every spark,
	Cigar, headlamp or railway warning
	To knock off your wings and starve by morning?
	And what could a moth fear in the dark
	 
	Compared with what you meet inside?
	Still, he rams the fluorescent face
	Of the clock, thinks that’s another place
	Of light and families, where he’ll hide.
	 
	We’d ought to trap him in a jar,
	Or come, like the white-coats, with a net
	And turn him out toward living. Yet
	We don’t; we take things as they are.


14. MAGDA GOEBBELS

	_(After Dr. Haase gave them shots of morphine, Magda gave each child an ampule of potassium cyanide from a spoon.)_
	
	This is the needle that we give
	Soldiers and children when they live   
	Near the front in primitive
	    Conditions or real dangers;
	This is the spoon we use to feed   
	Men trapped in trouble or in need,   
	When weakness or bad luck might lead
	    Them to the hands of strangers.
	
	This is the room where you can sleep   
	Your sleep out, curled up under deep   
	Layers of covering that will keep
	    You safe till all harm’s past.
	This is the bed where you can rest   
	In perfect silence, undistressed
	By noise or nightmares, as my breast   
	    Once held you soft but fast.
	
	This is the Doctor who has brought   
	Your needle with your special shot   
	To quiet you; you won’t get caught
	    Off guard or unprepared.
	I am your nurse who’ll comfort you;   
	I nursed you, fed you till you grew   
	Too big to feed; now you’re all through
	    Fretting or feeling scared.
	
	This is the glass tube that contains
	Calm that will spread down through your veins   
	To free you finally from all pains
	    Of going on in error.
	This tiny pinprick sets the germ
	Inside you that fills out its term
	Till you can feel yourself grow firm
	    Against all doubt, all terror.
	
	Into this spoon I break the pill   
	That stiffens the unsteady will   
	And hardens you against the chill
	    Voice of a world of lies.
	This amber medicine implants   
	Steadfastness in your blood; this grants   
	Immunity from greed and chance,
	    And from all compromise.
	
	This is the serum that can cure
	Weak hearts; these pure, clear drops insure   
	You’ll face what comes and can endure   
	    The test; you’ll never falter.
	This is the potion that preserves
	You in a faith that never swerves;
	This sets the pattern of your nerves
	    Too firm for you to alter.
	
	I set this spoon between your tight   
	Teeth, as I gave you your first bite;   
	This satisfies your appetite
	    For other nourishment.
	Take this on your tongue; this do   
	Remembering your mother who
	So loved her Leader she stayed true
	    When all the others went,
	
	When every friend proved false, in the   
	Delirium of treachery
	On every hand, when even He
	    Had turned His face aside.
	He shut himself in with His whore;
	Then, though I screamed outside His door,   
	Said He’d not see me anymore.
	    They both took cyanide.
	
	Open wide, now, little bird;
	I who sang you your first word
	Soothe away every sound you’ve heard   
	    Except your Leader’s voice.
	Close your eyes, now; take your death.   
	Once we slapped you to take breath.   
	Vengeance is mine, the Lord God saith
	    And cancels each last choice.
	
	Once, my first words marked out your mind;   
	Just as our Leader’s phrases bind
	All hearts to Him, building a blind
	    Loyalty through the nation,
	We shape you into a pure form.
	Trapped, our best soldiers tricked the storm,   
	The Reds: those last hours, they felt warm   
	    Who stood fast to their station.
	
	You needn’t fear what your life meant;
	You won’t curse how your hours were spent;   
	You’ll grow like your own monument
	    To all things sure and good,
	Fixed like a frieze in high relief
	Of granite figures that our Chief
	Accepts into His true belief,
	    His true blood-brotherhood.
	
	You’ll never bite the hand that fed you,   
	Won’t turn away from those that bred you,   
	Comforted your nights and led you
	    Into the thought of virtue;
	You won’t be turned from your own bed;   
	Won’t turn into that thing you dread;   
	No new betrayal lies ahead;
	    Now no one else can hurt you.


15. MEMENTOS, 1

	Sorting out letters and piles of my old
	    Canceled checks, old clippings, and yellow note cards   
	That meant something once, I happened to find
	    Your picture. _That_ picture. I stopped there cold,   
	Like a man raking piles of dead leaves in his yard
	             Who has turned up a severed hand.
	
	Still, that first second, I was glad: you stand
	    Just as you stood--shy, delicate, slender,
	In that long gown of green lace netting and daisies
	    That you wore to our first dance. The sight of you stunned   
	Us all. Well, our needs were different, then,
	             And our ideals came easy.
	
	Then through the war and those two long years
	    Overseas, the Japanese dead in their shacks   
	Among dishes, dolls, and lost shoes; I carried
	    This glimpse of you, there, to choke down my fear,   
	Prove it had been, that it might come back.
	             That was before we got married.
	
	--Before we drained out one another’s force   
	    With lies, self-denial, unspoken regret
	And the sick eyes that blame; before the divorce
	    And the treachery. Say it: before we met. Still,   
	I put back your picture. Someday, in due course,
	             I will find that it’s still there.


16. MONET: LES NYMPHÉAS

	The eyelids glowing, some chill morning.
	O world half-known through opening, twilit lids   
	    Before the vague face clenches into light;
	O universal waters like a cloud,
	    Like those first clouds of half-created matter;
	O all things rising, rising like the fumes
	    From waters falling, O forever falling;
	Infinite, the skeletal shells that fall, relinquished,
	    The snowsoft sift of the diatoms, like selves   
	Downdrifting age upon age through milky oceans;
	    O slow downdrifting of the atoms;
	O island nebulae and O the nebulous islands
	    Wandering these mists like falsefires, which are true,   
	Bobbing like milkweed, like warm lanterns bobbing
	    Through the snowfilled windless air, blinking and passing   
	As we pass into the memory of women
	    Who are passing. Within those depths   
	What ravening? What devouring rage?
	    How shall our living know its ends of yielding?   
	These things have taken me as the mouth an orange--
	    That acrid sweet juice entering every cell;   
	And I am shared out. I become these things:
	    These lilies, if these things are water lilies   
	Which are dancers growing dim across no floor;
	    These mayflies; whirled dust orbiting in the sun;
	This blossoming diffused as rushlights; galactic vapors;
	    Fluorescence into which we pass and penetrate;   
	O soft as the thighs of women;
	    O radiance, into which I go on dying . . .


17. NIGHTWATCHMAN’S SONG

	I 
	
	What’s unseen may not exist--  
	Or so those secret powers insist   
	            That prowl past nightfall,   
	Enabled by the brain’s blacklist   
	            To fester out of sight,   
	
	So we streak from bad to worse,   
	Through an expanding universe   
	            And see no evil.   
	On my rounds like a night nurse   
	            Or sentry on qui vive,   
	
	I make, through murkier hours, my way   
	Where the sun patrolled all day   
	            Toward stone-blind midnight   
	To poke this flickering flashlamp’s ray   
	            At what’s hushed up and hidden.   
	
	Lacking all leave or protocol,   
	Things, one by one, hear my footfall,   
	            Blank out their faces,   
	Dodge between trees, find cracks in walls   
	            Or lock down offices.   
	
	Still, though scuttling forces flee   
	Just as far stars recede from me   
	            To outmost boundaries,   
	I stalk through ruins and debris,   
	            Graveyard and underground.   
	
	Led by their helmetlantern’s light   
	Miners inch through anthracite;   
	            I’m the unblinking mole   
	That sniffs out what gets lost or might   
	            Slip down the world’s black hole.   
	
	
	II 
	
	(ending his rounds, the watchman, somewhat tipsy, returns) 
	
	What’s obscene?--just our obsessed,   
	Incessant itch and interest   
	      In things found frightful:   
	In bestial tortures, rape, incest;   
	      In ripe forbidden fruit   
	
	Dangling, lush, just out of reach;   
	Dim cellars nailed up under each   
	      Towering success,   
	The loser’s envy that will teach   
	      A fierce vindictiveness,   
	
	The victors’ high court that insures   
	Pardon for winners and procures   
	      Little that’s needed   
	But all we lust for. What endures?--  
	      Exponential greed   
	
	And trash containers overflowing   
	With shredded memos, records showing   
	      What, who, when, why   
	’Til there’s no sure way of knowing   
	      What’s clear to every eye:   
	
	The heart’s delight in hatred, runny   
	As the gold drip from combs of honey;   
	      The rectal intercourse   
	Of power politics and money   
	      That slimes both goal and source.   
	
	What’s obscured?--what’s abscessed.   
	After inspection, I’d suggest   
	      It’s time we got our head   
	Rewired. I plan to just get pissed,   
	      Shitfaced and brain-dead.


18. PACEMAKER

	I 
	
	“One Snodgrass, two Snodgrass, three Snodgrass, four . . .”
	       I took my own rollcall when I counted seconds; 
	“One two three, Two two three, Three . . .”, the drum score 
	       Showed only long rests to the tympani’s entrance. 
	
	“Oh-oh-oh leff; leff; leff-toh-righ-toh-leff,”
	       The sergeant cadenced us footsore recruits; 
	The heart, poor drummer, gone lame, deaf, 
	       Then AWOL, gets frogmarched to the noose. 
	
	
	II 
	
	Old coots, at the Veterans’, might catch breath 
	       If their cheeks got slapped by a nurse’s aide, 
	Then come back to life; just so, at their birth, 
	       Young rumps had been tendered warm accolades. 
	
	The kick-ass rude attitude, smart-assed insult, 
	       The acid-fueled book review just might shock 
	Us back to the brawl like smelling salts, 
	       Might sting the lulled heart up off its blocks. 
	
	
	III 
	
	I thought I’d always favor rubato 
	       Or syncopation, scorning fixed rhythms; 
	               Thought my old heartthrobs could stand up to stress; 
	Believed one’s bloodpump should skip a few beats 
	       If it fell into company with sleek young women; 
	               Believed my own bruit could beat with the best. 
	
	Wrong again, Snodgrass! This new gold gadget, 
	       Snug as the watch on my wife’s warm wrist, 
	               Drives my pulsetempo near twice its old pace--
	Go, nonstop startwatch! Go, clockwork rabbit, 
	       Keeping this lame old dog synchronized, 
	               Steady, sparked up, still in the race.


19. THE POET RIDICULED BY HYSTERIC ACADEMICS

	Is it, then, your opinion
	Women are putty in your hands?
	Is this the face to launch upon
	A thousand one night stands?
	
	First, please, would you be so kind
	As to define your contribution
	To modern verse, the Western mind
	And human institutions?
	
	Where, where is the long, flowing hair,
	The velvet suit, the broad bow tie;
	Where is the other-worldly air,
	Where the abstracted eye?
	
	Describe the influence on your verse
	Of Oscar Mudwarp’s mighty line,
	The theories of Susan Schmersch
	Or the spondee’s decline.
	
	You’ve labored to present us with
	This mouse-sized volume; shall this equal
	The epic glories of Joe Smith?
	He’s just brought out a sequel.
	
	Where are the beard, the bongo drums,
	Tattered T-shirt and grubby sandals,
	As who, released from Iowa, comes
	To tell of wondrous scandals?
	
	Have you subversive, out of date,
	Or controversial ideas?
	And can you really pull your weight
	Among such minds as these?
	
	Ah, what avails the tenure race,
	Ah, what the Ph.D.,
	When all departments have a place
	For nincompoops like thee?


20. REICHSMARSCHALL HERMANN GÖRING

	_(Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, once bragged that if one German city were bombed, they could call him “Meier.” At his Karinhall estate, he questions himself and his disgrace.)_
	
	And why, Herr Reichsmarschall, is Italy   
	Just like schnitzel? If they’re beaten   
	Either one will just get bigger.
	Neither cuts too firm a figure. 
	Still, all this humble pie you’ve eaten   
	Lately, fills you out quite prettily.
	
	Why then, Herr Göring, how can we   
	Tell you and Italy apart?
	Italy always wins through losing;
	I, just the opposite, by using
	High skills and cunning learned the art   
	Of flat pratfalls through victory.
	
	You’ve led our Flying Circus; how   
	Could our war ace turn to a clown?   
	Both pad out over-extended fronts;   
	Both keep alive doing slick stunts   
	And, even so, both get shot down.   
	But only one’s called “Meier” now.
	
	Pray, could an old, soft football be   
	Much like a man in deep disgrace?   
	They don’t kick back; don’t even dare   
	Look up--the British own the air!   
	Then, stick a needle in someplace;   
	Pump yourself full of vacancy.
	
	Tell us, dear Minister for Air,
	Are warriors, then, like a bad smell?
	Neither stays inside its borders;
	Either’s bound to follow ordures;
	They both expand and play the swell
	Though something’s getting spoiled somewhere.
	
	Then answer one more question, which is   
	Are politicians like whipped cream?
	They both inflate themselves with gas;   
	Also they both puff up your ass
	Till you’re exposed like some bad dream   
	Where you’ve grown too big for your britches.
	
	Herr President, can’t we tell apart   
	An artful statesman and an ass?
	Fat chance! One spouts out high ideals;   
	One makes low rumblings after meals.   
	But that’s the threat of leaking gas   
	Which all men fear! No; that’s a fart.
	
	Last, could you give one simple rule   
	To tell a medal from a turd?
	No. They both come from those above you   
	Conveying their opinion of you. 
	Right! Here’s your new medal, conferred   
	For vast achievements: April Fool!


21. SITTING OUTSIDE

	These lawn chairs and the chaise lounge
	of bulky redwood were purchased for my father
	twenty years ago, then plumped down in the yard
	where he seldom went when he could still work
	and never had stayed long. His left arm
	in a sling, then lopped off, he smoked there or slept
	while the weather lasted, watched what cars passed,
	read stock reports, counted pills,
	then dozed again. I didn’t go there
	in those last weeks, sick of the delusions
	they still maintained, their talk of plans
	for some boat tour or a trip to the Bahamas
	once he’d recovered. Under our willows,
	this old set’s done well: we’ve sat with company,
	read or taken notes--although the arm rests
	get dry and splintery or wheels drop off
	so the whole frame’s weakened if it’s hauled
	across rough ground.  Of course the trees,
	too, may not last: leaves storm down,
	branches crack off, the riddled bark
	separates, then gets shed. I have a son, myself,
	with things to be looked after. I sometimes think
	since I’ve retired, sitting in the shade here
	and feeling the winds shift, I must have been filled
	with a child dread you could catch somebody’s dying
	if you got too close. And you can’t be too sure.


22. SONG

	Observe the cautious toadstools
	    still on the lawn today
	though they grow over-evening;
	    sun shrinks them away.
	Pale and proper and rootless,
	    they righteously extort
	their living from the living.
	    I have been their sort.
	
	See by our blocked foundation
	    the cold, archaic clay,
	stiff and clinging and sterile
	    as children mold at play
	or as the Lord God fashioned
	    before He breathed it breath.
	The earth we dig and carry
	    for flowers, is strong in death.
	
	Woman, we are the rich
	    soil, friable and humble,
	where all our murders rot,
	    where our old deaths crumble
	and fortify my reach
	    far from you, wide and free,
	though I have set my root
	    in you and am your tree.


23. SWEET BEAST, I HAVE GONE PROWLING

	Sweet beast, I have gone prowling,
	    a proud rejected man
	who lived along the edges
	    catch as catch can;
	in darkness and in hedges
	    I sang my sour tone
	and all my love was howling
	    conspicuously alone.
	
	I curled and slept all day
	    or nursed my bloodless wounds
	until the squares were silent
	    where I could make my tunes
	singular and violent.
	    Then, sure as hearers came
	I crept and flinched away.
	    And, girl, you’ve done the same.
	
	A stray from my own type,
	    led along by blindness,
	my love was near to spoiled
	    and curdled all my kindness.
	I find no kin, no child;
	    only the weasel’s ilk.
	Sweet beast, cat of my own stripe,
	    come and take my milk.


24. THESE TREES STAND

	These trees stand very tall under the heavens.
	While _they_ stand, if I walk, all stars traverse
	This steep celestial gulf their branches chart.
	Though lovers stand at sixes and at sevens
	While civilizations come down with the curse,
	Snodgrass is walking through the universe.
	
	I can’t make any world go around your house.
	But note this moon. Recall how the night nurse
	Goes ward-rounds, by the mild, reflective art
	Of focusing her flashlight on her blouse.
	Your name’s safe conduct into love or verse;
	Snodgrass is walking through the universe.
	
	Your name’s absurd, miraculous as sperm
	And as decisive. If you can’t coerce
	One thing outside yourself, why you’re the poet!
	What irrefrangible atoms whirl, affirm
	Their destiny and form Lucinda’s skirts!
	She can’t make up your mind. Soon as you know it,
	Your firmament grows touchable and firm.
	If all this world runs battlefield or worse,
	Come, let us wipe our glasses on our shirts:
	Snodgrass is walking through the universe.


25. VUILLARD

	_(Instructions for the Visit)_
	
	Admire, when you come here, the glimmering hair
	Of the girl; praise her pale
	Complexion. Think well of her dress
	Though that is somewhat out of fashion.
	Don’t try to take her hand, but smile for
	Her hesitant gentleness.
	Say the old woman is looking strong
	Today; such hardiness. Remark,
	Perhaps, how she has dressed herself black
	Like a priest, and wears that sufficient air
	That does become the righteous.
	As you approach, she will push back
	Her chair, shove away her plate
	And wait,
	Sitting squat and direct, before
	The red mahogany chest
	Massive as some great
	Safe; will wait,
	By the table and her greasy plate,
	The bone half-chewed, her wine half-drained;
	She will wait. And fix her steady
	Eyes on you--the straight stare
	Of an old politician.
	Try once to meet her eyes. But fail.
	Let your sight
	Drift--yet never as if hunting for
	The keys (you keep imagining) hung
	By her belt. (They are not there.)
	Watch, perhaps, that massive chest--the way
	It tries to lean
	Forward, toward her, till it seems to rest
	Its whole household’s weight
	Of linens and clothing and provisions
	All on her stiff back.
	It might be strapped there like the monstrous pack
	Of some enchanted pedlar. Dense, self-contained,
	Like mercury in a ball,
	She can support this without strain,
	Yet she grows smaller, wrinkling
	Like a potato, parched as dung;
	It cramps her like a fist.
	Ask no one why the chest
	Has no knobs. Betray
	No least suspicion
	The necessities within
	Could vanish at her
	Will. Try not to think
	That as she feeds, gains
	Specific gravity,
	She shrinks, light-
	less as the world’s
	Hard core
	And the per-
	spective drains
	In her.
	Finally, above all,
	You must not ever see,
	Or let slip one hint you can see,
	On the other side, the girl’s
	Cuffs, like cordovan restraints;
	Forget her bony, tentative wrist,
	The half-fed, worrying eyes, and how
	She backs out, bows, and tries to bow
	Out of the scene, grows too ethereal
	To make a shape inside her dress
	And the dress itself is beginning already
	To sublime itself away like a vapor
	That merges into the empty twinkling
	Of the air and of the bright wallpaper.


26. WHO STEALS MY GOOD NAME

	_For the person who obtained my debit card number and spent $11,000 in five days_
	
	My pale stepdaughter, just off the school bus, 
	Scowled, “Well, that’s the last time I say my name’s 
	Snodgrass!” Just so, may that anonymous 
	Mexican male who prodigally claims 
	
	My clan lines, identity and the sixteen 
	Digits that unlock my bank account, 
	Think twice. That less than proper name’s been 
	Taken by three ex-wives, each for an amount 
	
	Past all you’ve squandered, each more than pleased 
	To change it back. That surname you affect 
	May have more consequence than getting teased 
	By dumb kids or tracked down by bank detectives. 
	
	Don’t underrate its history: one of ours played 
	Piano on his prison’s weekly broadcast; 
	One got rich on a scammed quiz show; one made 
	A bungle costing the World Series. My own past 
	
	Could subject you to guilt by association: 
	If you write anything more than false checks, 
	Abandon all hope of large press publication 
	Or prizes--critics shun the name like sex 
	
	Without a condom. Whoever steals my purse 
	Helps chain me to my writing desk again 
	For fun and profit. So take thanks with my curse: 
	May your pen name help send you to _your_ pen.
