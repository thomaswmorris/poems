*** W. D. Snodgrass (1926 - 2009)


1. AFTER EXPERIENCE

	After experience taught me that all the ordinary 
	Surroundings of social life are futile and vain; 
	
	I’m going to show you something very 
	Ugly: someday, it might save your life. 
	
	Seeing that none of the things I feared contain 
	In themselves anything either good or bad 
	
	What if you get caught without a knife; 
	Nothing—even a loop of piano wire; 
	
	Excepting only in the effect they had 
	Upon my mind, I resolved to inquire 
	
	Take the first two fingers of this hand; 
	Fork them out—kind of a “V for Victory”--
	
	Whether there might be something whose discovery 
	Would grant me supreme, unending happiness. 
	
	And jam them into the eyes of your enemy. 
	You have to do this hard. Very hard. Then press 
	
	No virtue can be thought to have priority 
	Over this endeavor to preserve one’s being. 
	
	Both fingers down around the cheekbone 
	And setting your foot high into the chest 
	
	No man can desire to act rightly, to be blessed, 
	To live rightly, without simultaneously 
	
	You must call up every strength you own 
	And you can rip off the whole facial mask. 
	
	Wishing to be, to act, to live. He must ask 
	First, in other words, to actually exist. 
	
	
	And you, whiner, who wastes your time 
	Dawdling over the remorseless earth, 
	What evil, what unspeakable crime 
	Have you made your life worth?


2. APRIL INVENTORY

	The green catalpa tree has turned 
	All white; the cherry blooms once more. 
	In one whole year I haven’t learned 
	A blessed thing they pay you for. 
	The blossoms snow down in my hair; 
	The trees and I will soon be bare. 
	
	The trees have more than I to spare. 
	The sleek, expensive girls I teach, 
	Younger and pinker every year, 
	Bloom gradually out of reach. 
	The pear tree lets its petals drop 
	Like dandruff on a tabletop. 
	
	The girls have grown so young by now 
	I have to nudge myself to stare. 
	This year they smile and mind me how 
	My teeth are falling with my hair. 
	In thirty years I may not get 
	Younger, shrewder, or out of debt. 
	
	The tenth time, just a year ago, 
	I made myself a little list 
	Of all the things I’d ought to know, 
	Then told my parents, analyst, 
	And everyone who’s trusted me 
	I’d be substantial, presently. 
	
	I haven’t read one book about 
	A book or memorized one plot. 
	Or found a mind I did not doubt. 
	I learned one date.And then forgot. 
	And one by one the solid scholars 
	Get the degrees, the jobs, the dollars. 
	
	And smile above their starchy collars. 
	I taught my classes Whitehead’s notions; 
	One lovely girl, a song of Mahler’s. 
	Lacking a source-book or promotions, 
	I showed one child the colors of 
	A luna moth and how to love. 
	
	I taught myself to name my name, 
	To bark back, loosen love and crying; 
	To ease my woman so she came, 
	To ease an old man who was dying. 
	I have not learned how often I 
	Can win, can love, but choose to die. 
	
	I have not learned there is a lie 
	Love shall be blonder, slimmer, younger; 
	That my equivocating eye 
	Loves only by my body’s hunger; 
	That I have forces true to feel, 
	Or that the lovely world is real. 
	
	While scholars speak authority 
	And wear their ulcers on their sleeves, 
	My eyes in spectacles shall see 
	These trees procure and spend their leaves. 
	There is a value underneath 
	The gold and silver in my teeth. 
	
	Though trees turn bare and girls turn wives, 
	We shall afford our costly seasons; 
	There is a gentleness survives 
	That will outspeak and has its reasons. 
	There is a loveliness exists, 
	Preserves us, not for specialists.


3. HEART’S NEEDLE

	I
	
	Child of my winter, born 
	When the new fallen soldiers froze 
	In Asia’s steep ravines and fouled the snows, 
	When I was torn 
	
	By love I could not still, 
	By fear that silenced my cramped mind 
	To that cold war where, lost, I could not find 
	My peace in my will, 
	
	All those days we could keep 
	Your mind a landscape of new snow 
	Where the chilled tenant-farmer finds, below, 
	His fields asleep 
	
	In their smooth covering, white 
	As quilts to warm the resting bed 
	Of birth or pain, spotless as paper spread 
	For me to write, 
	
	And thinks: Here lies my land 
	Unmarked by agony, the lean foot 
	Of the weasel tracking, the thick trapper’s boot; 
	And I have planned 
	
	My chances to restrain 
	The torments of demented summer or 
	Increase the deepening harvest here before 
	It snows again. 
	
	
	II
	
	Late April and you are three; today 
	We dug your garden in the yard. 
	To curb the damage of your play, 
	Strange dogs at night and the moles tunneling, 
	Four slender sticks of lath stand guard 
	Uplifting their thin string. 
	
	So you were the first to tramp it down. 
	And after the earth was sifted close 
	You brought your watering can to drown 
	All earth and us. But these mixed seeds are pressed 
	With light loam in their steadfast rows. 
	Child, we’ve done our best. 
	
	Someone will have to weed and spread 
	The young sprouts. Sprinkle them in the hour 
	When shadow falls across their bed. 
	You should try to look at them every day 
	Because when they come to full flower 
	I will be away. 
	
	
	III
	
	The child between them on the street 
	Comes to a puddle, lifts his feet 
	And hangs on their hands. They start 
	At the Jive weight and lurch together, 
	Recoil to swing him through the weather, 
	Stiffen and pull apart. 
	
	We read of cold war soldiers that 
	Never gained ground, gave none, but sat 
	Tight in their chill trenches. 
	Pain seeps up from some cavity 
	Through the ranked teeth in sympathy; 
	The whole jaw grinds and clenches 
	
	Till something somewhere has to give. 
	It’s better the poor soldiers live 
	In someone else’s hands 
	Than drop where helpless powers fall 
	On crops and barns, on towns where all 
	Will burn. And no man stands. 
	
	For good, they sever and divide 
	Their won and lost land. On each side 
	Prisoners are returned 
	Excepting a few unknown names. 
	The peasant plods back and reclaims 
	His fields that strangers burned 
	
	And nobody seems very pleased. 
	It’s best. Still, what must not be seized 
	Clenches the empty fist. 
	I tugged your hand, once, when I hated 
	Things less: a mere game dislocated 
	The radius of your wrist. 
	
	Love’s wishbone, child, although I’ve gone 
	As men must and let you be drawn 
	Off to appease another, 
	It may help that a Chinese play 
	Or Solomon himself might say 
	I am your real mother. 
	
	
	IV. 
	
	No one can tell you why 
	the season will not wait; 
	the night I told you I 
	must leave, you wept a fearful rate 
	to stay up late. 
	
	Now that it’s turning Fan, 
	we go to take our walk 
	among municipal 
	flowers, to steal one off its stalk, 
	to try and talk. 
	
	We huff like windy giants 
	scattering with our breath 
	gray-headed dandelions; 
	Spring is the cold wind’s aftermath. 
	The poet saith. 
	
	But the asters, too, are gray, 
	ghost-gray. Last night’s cold 
	is sending on their way 
	petunias and dwarf marigold, 
	hunched sick and old. 
	
	Like nerves caught in a graph, 
	the morning-glory vines 
	frost has erased by half 
	still scrawl across their rigid twines. 
	Like broken lines 
	
	of verses I can’t make. 
	In its unraveling loom 
	we find a flower to take, 
	with some late buds that might still bloom, 
	back to your room. 
	
	Night comes and the stiff dew. 
	I’m told a friend’s child cried 
	because a cricket, who 
	had minstreled every night outside 
	her window, died. 
	
	
	V. 
	
	Winter again and it is snowing; 
	Although you are still three, 
	You are already growing 
	Strange to me. 
	
	You chatter about new playmates, sing 
	Strange songs; you do not know 
	Hey ding-a-ding-a-ding 
	Or where I go 
	
	Or when I sang for bedtime, Fox 
	Went out on a chilly night, 
	Before I went for walks 
	And did not write; 
	
	You never mind the squalls and storms 
	That are renewed long since; 
	Outside, the thick snow swarms 
	Into my prints 
	
	And swirls out by warehouses, sealed, 
	Dark cowbarns, huddled, still, 
	Beyond to the blank field, 
	The fox’s hill 
	
	Where he backtracks and sees the paw, 
	Gnawed off, he cannot feel; 
	Conceded to the jaw 
	Of toothed, blue steel. 
	
	
	VI
	
	Easter has come around 
	again; the river is rising 
	over the thawed ground 
	and the banksides. When you come you bring 
	an egg dyed lavender. 
	We shout along our bank to hear 
	our voices returning from the hills to meet us. 
	We need the landscape to repeat us. 
	
	You Jived on this bank first. 
	While nine months filled your term, we knew 
	how your lungs, immersed 
	in the womb, miraculously grew 
	their useless folds till 
	the fierce, cold air rushed in to fill 
	them out like bushes thick with leaves. You took your hour, 
	caught breath, and cried with your full lung power. 
	
	Over the stagnant bight 
	we see the hungry bank swallow 
	flaunting his free flight 
	still; we sink in mud to follow 
	the killdeer from the grass 
	that hides her nest. That March there was 
	rain; the rivers rose; you could hear killdeers flying 
	all night over the mudflats crying. 
	
	You bring back how the red--
	winged blackbird shrieked, slapping frail wings, 
	diving at my head— 
	I saw where her tough nest, cradled, swings 
	in tall reeds that must sway 
	with the winds blowing every way. 
	If you recall much, you recall this place. You still 
	live nearby—on the opposite hill. 
	
	After the sharp windstorm 
	of July Fourth, all that summer 
	through the gentle, warm 
	afternoons, we heard great chain saws chirr 
	like iron locusts. Crews 
	of roughneck boys swarmed to cut loose 
	branches wrenched in the shattering wind, to hack free 
	all the torn limbs that could sap the tree. 
	
	In the debris lay 
	starlings, dead. Near the park’s birdrun 
	we surprised one day 
	a proud, tan-spatted, buff-brown pigeon. 
	In my hands she flapped so 
	fearfully that I let her go. 
	Her keeper came. And we helped snarl her in a net. 
	You bring things I’d as soon forget. 
	
	You raise into my head 
	a Fall night that I came once more 
	to sit on your bed; 
	sweat beads stood out on your arms and fore- 
	head and you wheezed for breath, 
	for help, like some child caught beneath 
	its comfortable wooly blankets, drowning there. 
	Your lungs caught and would not take the air. 
	
	Of all things, only we 
	have power to choose that we should die; 
	nothing else is free 
	in this world to refuse it. Yet I, 
	who say this, could not raise 
	myself from bed how many days 
	to the thieving world. Child, I have another wife, 
	another child. We try to choose our life. 
	
	
	VII
	
	Here in the scuffled dust 
	is our ground of play. 
	I lift you on your swing and must 
	shove you away, 
	see you return again, 
	drive you off again, then 
	
	stand quiet till you come. 
	You, though you climb 
	higher, farther from me, longer, 
	will fall back to me stronger. 
	Bad penny, pendulum, 
	you keep my constant time 
	
	to bob in blue July 
	where fat goldfinches fly 
	over the glittering, fecund 
	reach of our growing lands. 
	Once more now, this second, 
	I hold you in my hands. 
	
	
	XIII
	
	I thumped on you the best I could 
	which was no use; 
	you would not tolerate your food 
	until the sweet, fresh milk was soured 
	with lemon juice. 
	
	That puffed you up like a fine yeast. 
	The first June in your yard 
	like some squat Nero at a feast 
	you sat and chewed on white, sweet clover. 
	That is over. 
	
	When you were old enough to walk 
	we went to feed 
	the rabbits in the park milkweed; 
	saw the paired monkeys, under lock, 
	consume each other’s salt. 
	
	Going home we watched the slow 
	stars follow us down Heaven’s vault. 
	You said, let’s catch one that comes low, 
	pull off its skin 
	and cook it for our dinner. 
	
	As absentee bread-winner, 
	I seldom got you such cuisine; 
	we ate in local restaurants 
	or bought what lunches we could pack 
	in a brown sack 
	
	with stale, dry bread to toss for ducks 
	on the green-scummed lagoons, 
	crackers for porcupine and fox, 
	life-savers for the footpad coons 
	to scour and rinse, 
	
	snatch after in their muddy pail 
	and stare into their paws. 
	When I moved next door to the jail 
	I learned to fry 
	omelettes and griddle cakes so I 
	
	could set you supper at my table. 
	As I built back from helplessness, 
	when I grew able, 
	the only possible answer was 
	you had to come here less. 
	
	This Hallowe’en you come one week. 
	You masquerade 
	as a vermilion, sleek, 
	fat, crosseyed fox in the parade 
	or, where grim jackolanterns leer, 
	
	go with your bag from door to door 
	foraging for treats. How queer: 
	when you take off your mask 
	my neighbors must forget and ask 
	whose child you are. 
	
	Of course you lose your appetite, 
	whine and won’t touch your plate; 
	as local law 
	I set your place on an orange crate 
	in your own room for days. At night 
	
	you lie asleep there on the bed 
	and grate your jaw. 
	Assuredly your father’s crimes 
	are visited 
	on you. You visit me sometimes. 
	
	The time’s up. Now our pumpkin sees 
	me bringing your suitcase. 
	He holds his grin; 
	the forehead shrivels, sinking in. 
	You break this year’s first crust of snow 
	
	off the runningboard to eat. 
	We manage, though for days 
	I crave sweets when you leave and know 
	they rot my teeth. Indeed our sweet 
	foods leave us cavities. 
	
	
	IX. 
	
	I get numb and go in 
	though the dry ground will not hold 
	the few dry swirls of snow 
	and it must not be very cold. 
	A friend asks how you’ve been 
	and I don’t know 
	
	or see much right to ask. 
	Or what use it could be to know. 
	In three months since you came 
	the leaves have fallen and the snow; 
	your pictures pinned above my desk 
	seem much the same. 
	
	Somehow I come to find 
	myself upstairs in the third floor 
	museum’s halls, 
	walking to kill my time once more 
	among the enduring and resigned 
	stuffed animals, 
	
	where, through a century’s 
	caprice, displacement and 
	known treachery between 
	its wars, they hear some old command 
	and in their peaceable kingdoms freeze 
	to this still scene, 
	
	Nature Morte. Here 
	by the door, its guardian, 
	the patchwork dodo stands 
	where you and your stepsister ran 
	laughing and pointing. Here, last year, 
	you pulled my hands 
	
	and had your first, worst quarrel, 
	so toys were put up on your shelves. 
	Here in the first glass cage 
	the little bobcats arch themselves, 
	still practicing their snarl 
	of constant rage. 
	
	The bison, here, immense, 
	shoves at his calf, brow to brow, 
	and looks it in the eye 
	to see what is it thinking now. 
	I forced you to obedience; 
	I don’t know why. 
	
	Still the lean lioness 
	beyond them, on her jutting ledge 
	of shale and desert shrub, 
	stands watching always at the edge, 
	stands hard and tanned and envious 
	above her cub; 
	
	with horns locked in tan heather, 
	two great Olympian Elk stand bound, 
	fixed in their lasting hate 
	till hunger brings them both to ground. 
	Whom equal weakness binds together 
	none shall separate. 
	
	Yet separate in the ocean 
	of broken ice, the white bear reels 
	beyond the leathery groups 
	of scattered, drab Arctic seals 
	arrested here in violent motion 
	like Napoleon’s troops. 
	
	Our states have stood so long 
	At war, shaken with hate and dread, 
	they are paralyzed at bay; 
	once we were out of reach, we said, 
	we would grow reasonable and strong. 
	Some other day. 
	
	Like the cold men of Rome, 
	we have won costly fields to sow 
	in salt, our only seed. 
	Nothing but injury will grow. 
	I write you only the bitter poems 
	that you can’t read. 
	
	Onan who would not breed 
	a child to take his brother’s bread 
	and be his brother’s birth, 
	rose up and left his lawful bed, 
	went out and spilled his seed 
	in the cold earth. 
	
	I stand by the unborn, 
	by putty-colored children curled 
	in jars of alcohol, 
	that waken to no other world, 
	unchanging, where no eye shall mourn. 
	I see the caul 
	
	that wrapped a kitten, dead. 
	I see the branching, doubled throat 
	of a two-headed foal; 
	I see the hydrocephalic goat; 
	here is the curled and swollen head, 
	there, the burst skull; 
	
	skin of a limbless calf; 
	a horse’s foetus, mummified; 
	mounted and joined forever, 
	the Siamese twin dogs that ride 
	belly to belly, half and half, 
	that none shall sever. 
	
	I walk among the growths, 
	by gangrenous tissue, goiter, cysts, 
	by fistulas and cancers, 
	where the malignancy man loathes 
	is held suspended and persists. 
	And I don’t know the answers. 
	
	The window’s turning white. 
	The world moves like a diseased heart 
	packed with ice and snow. 
	Three months now we have been apart 
	less than a mile. I cannot fight 
	or let you go. 
	10 
	
	The vicious winter finally yields 
	the green winter wheat; 
	the farmer, tired in the tired fields 
	he dare not leave will eat. 
	
	Once more the runs come fresh; prevailing 
	piglets, stout as jugs, 
	harry their old sow to the railing 
	to ease her swollen dugs 
	
	and game colts trail the herded mares 
	that circle the pasture courses; 
	our seasons bring us back once more 
	like merry-go-round horses. 
	
	With crocus mouths, perennial hungers, 
	into the park Spring comes; 
	we roast hot dogs on old coat hangers 
	and feed the swan bread crumbs, 
	
	pay our respects to the peacocks, rabbits, 
	and leathery Canada goose 
	who took, last Fall, our tame white habits 
	and now will not turn loose. 
	
	In full regalia, the pheasant cocks 
	march past their dubious hens; 
	the porcupine and the lean, red fox 
	trot around bachelor pens 
	
	and the miniature painted train 
	wails on its oval track: 
	you said, I’m going to Pennsylvania! 
	and waved. And you’ve come back. 
	
	If I loved you, they said, I’d leave 
	and find my own affairs. 
	Well, once again this April, we’ve 
	come around to the bears; 
	
	punished and cared for, behind bars, 
	the coons on bread and water 
	stretch thin black fingers after ours. 
	And you are still my daughter.


4. A LOCKED HOUSE

	As we drove back, crossing the hill, 
	The house still 
	Hidden in the trees, I always thought--
	A fool’s fear—that it might have caught 
	Fire, someone could have broken in. 
	As if things must have been 
	Too good here. Still, we always found 
	It locked tight, safe and sound. 
	
	I mentioned that, once, as a joke; 
	No doubt we spoke 
	Of the absurdity 
	To fear some dour god’s jealousy 
	Of our good fortune. From the farm 
	Next door, our neighbors saw no harm 
	Came to the things we cared for here. 
	What did we have to fear? 
	
	Maybe I should have thought: all 
	Such things rot, fall--
	Barns, houses, furniture. 
	We two are stronger than we were 
	Apart; we’ve grown 
	Together. Everything we own 
	Can burn; we know what counts—some such 
	Idea. We said as much. 
	
	We’d watched friends driven to betray; 
	Felt that love drained away 
	Some self they need. 
	We’d said love, like a growth, can feed 
	On hate we turn in and disguise; 
	We warned ourselves. That you might despise 
	Me—hate all we both loved best--
	None of us ever guessed. 
	
	The house still stands, locked, as it stood 
	Untouched a good 
	Two years after you went. 
	Some things passed in the settlement; 
	Some things slipped away. Enough’s left 
	That I come back sometimes. The theft 
	And vandalism were our own. 
	Maybe we should have known.
