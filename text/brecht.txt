*** Bertolt Brecht (1898 - 1956)


1. ALABAMA SONG

	Show me the way to the next whisky bar
	Oh, don’t ask why, oh, don’t ask why
	Show me the way to the next whisky bar
	Oh, don’t ask why, oh, don’t ask why
	For if we don’t find the next whisky bar
	I tell you we must die
	I tell you we must die
	I tell you
	I tell you
	I tell you we must die
	
	Oh, moon of Alabama
	We now must say say good-bye
	We’ve lost our good old mamma
	And must have whisky
	Oh, you know why.
	
	Show me the way to the next pretty girl
	Oh, don’t ask why, oh, don’t ask why
	Show me the way to the next pretty girl
	Oh don’t ask why, oh, don’t ask why
	For if we don’t find the next pretty girl
	I tell you we must die
	I tell you we must die
	I tell you
	I tell you
	I tell you we must die
	
	Oh, moon of Alabama
	We now must say good-bye
	We’ve lost our good old mamma
	And must have a girl
	Oh, you know why.
	
	Show me the way to the next little dollar
	Oh, don’t ask why, oh, don’t ask why
	Show me the way to the next little dollar
	Oh, don’t ask why, oh, don’t ask why
	For if we don’t find the next little dollar
	I tell you we must die
	I tell you we must die
	I tell you
	I tell you
	I tell you we must die
	
	Oh, moon of Alabama
	We now must say good-bye
	We’ve lost our good old mamma
	And must have dollars
	Oh, you know why.


2. ALL OF US OR NONE

	Slave, who is it who shall free you?
	Those in deepest darkness lying,
	Comrade, these alone shall see you,
	They alone can hear you crying.
	Comrade, only slaves can free you.
	
	Everything or nothing. All of us or none.
	One alone his lot can’t better,
	Choose the gun or fetter.
	Everything or nothing. All of us or none.
	
	You who hunger, who shall feed you?
	If it’s bread you would be carving,
	Come to us, we, too, are starving.
	Come to us and let us lead you.
	Only hungry men can feed you.
	
	Everything or nothing. All of us or none.
	One alone his lot can’t better,
	Choose the gun or fetter.
	Everything or nothing. All of us or none.
	
	Beaten man, who shall avenge you?
	You, on whom the blows are falling,
	Hear your wounded brothers calling:
	Weakness gives us strength to lend you,
	Comrade, come, we shall avenge you.
	
	Everything or nothing. All of us or none.
	One alone his lot can’t better,
	Choose the gun or fetter.
	Everything or nothing. All of us or none.
	
	Who, O ruined man, shall dare it?
	He, who can no longer bear it,
	Counts the blows that arm his spirit,
	Taught the time by need and sorrow,
	Strikes today and not tomorrow.
	
	Everything or nothing. All of us or none.
	One alone his lot can’t better,
	Choose the gun or fetter.
	Everything or nothing. All of us or none.


3. THE BURNING OF THE BOOKS

	When the Regime ordered that books with dangerous teachings
	Should be publicly burat and everywhere
	Oxen were forced to draw carts full of books
	To the funeral pyre, an old poet, one of the best,
	Discovered with fury when he studied the list
	Of the burned, that his own books
	Had been forgotten. He rushed to his writing table
	On wings of anger and wrote a letter to those in power.
	Burn me, he wrote with hurrying pen, burn me!
	Do not treat me in this fashion.
	Don’t leave me out. Have I not
	Always taught truth in my books? And now
	You treat me like a liar! I order you:
	Burn me!


4. CONTEMPLATING HELL

	Contemplating Hell, as I once heard it,
	My brother Shelley found it to be a place
	Much like the city of London. I,
	Who do not live in London, but in Los Angeles,
	Find, contemplating Hell, that it
	Must be even more like Los Angeles.
	
	Also in Hell,
	I do not doubt it, there exist these opulent gardens
	With flowers as large as trees, wilting, of course,
	Very quickly, if they are not watered with very expensive water. And fruit markets
	With great leaps of fruit, which nonetheless
	
	Possess neither scent nor taste. And endless trains of autos,
	Lighter than their own shadows, swifter than
	Foolish thoughts, shimmering vehicles, in which
	Rosy people, coming from nowhere, go nowhere.
	And houses, designed for happiness, standing empty,
	Even when inhabited.
	
	Even the houses in Hell are not all ugly.
	But concern about being thrown into the street
	Consumes the inhabitants of the villas no less
	Than the inhabitants of the barracks.


5. HOLLYWOOD ELEGIES

	1
	
	Under the long green hair of pepper trees,
	The writers and composers work the street.
	Bach’s new score is crumpled in his pocket,
	Dante sways his ass-cheeks to the beat.
	
	
	2
	
	The city is named for the angels,
	And its angels are easy to find.
	They give off a lubricant odor,
	Their eyes are mascara-lined;
	At night you can see them inserting
	Gold-plated diaphragms;
	For breakfast they gather at poolside
	Where screenwriters feed and swim.
	
	
	3
	
	Every day, I go to earn my bread
	In the exchange where lies are marketed,
	Hoping my own lies will attract a bid.
	
	
	4
	
	It’s Hell, it’s Heaven: the amount you earn
	Determines if you play the harp or burn.
	
	
	5
	
	Gold in their mountains,
	Oil on their coast;
	Dreaming in celluloid
	Profits them most.


6. HOW FORTUNATE THE MAN WITH NONE

	You saw sagacious Solomon
	You know what came of him,
	To him complexities seemed plain.
	He cursed the hour that gave birth to him
	And saw that everything was vain.
	How great and wise was Solomon.
	The world however did not wait
	But soon observed what followed on.
	It’s wisdom that had brought him to this state.
	How fortunate the man with none.
	
	You saw courageous Caesar next
	You know what he became.
	They deified him in his life
	Then had him murdered just the same.
	And as they raised the fatal knife
	How loud he cried: you too my son!
	The world however did not wait
	But soon observed what followed on.
	It’s courage that had brought him to that state.
	How fortunate the man with none.
	
	You heard of honest Socrates
	The man who never lied:
	They weren’t so grateful as you’d think
	Instead the rulers fixed to have him tried
	And handed him the poisoned drink.
	How honest was the people’s noble son.
	The world however did not wait
	But soon observed what followed on.
	It’s honesty that brought him to that state.
	How fortunate the man with none.
	
	Here you can see respectable folk
	Keeping to God’s own laws.
	So far he hasn’t taken heed.
	You who sit safe and warm indoors
	Help to relieve our bitter need.
	How virtuously we had begun.
	The world however did not wait
	But soon observed what followed on.
	It’s fear of god that brought us to that state.
	How fortunate the man with none.


7. I NEVER LOVED YOU MORE

	I never loved you more, ma soeur
	Than as I walked away from you that evening.
	The forest swallowed me, the blue forest, ma soeur
	The blue forest and above it pale stars in the west.
	
	I did not laugh, not one little bit, ma soeur
	As I playfully walked towards a dark fate--
	While the faces behind me
	Slowly paled in the evening of the blue forest.
	
	Everything was grand that one night, ma soeur
	Never thereafter and never before--
	I admit it: I was left with nothing but the big birds
	And their hungry cries in the dark evening sky.


8. I WANT TO GO WITH THE ONE I LOVE

	I want to go with the one I love. 
	I do not want to calculate the cost. 
	I do not want to think about whether it’s good. 
	I do not want to know whether he loves me. 
	I want to go with whom I love.


9. I’M NOT SAYING ANYTHING AGAINST ALEXANDER

	Timur, I hear, took the trouble to conquer the earth.
	I don’t understand him.
	With a bit of hard liquor you can forget the earth.
	
	I’m not saying anything against Alexander,
	Only I have seen people who were remarkable,
	Highly deserving of your admiration
	For the fact that they were alive at all.
	
	Great men generate too much sweat.
	In all of this I see just a proof that
	They couldn’t stand being on their own
	And smoking and drinking and the like.
	And they must be too mean-spirited to get
	Contentment from sitting by a woman.


10. NOT WHAT WAS MEANT

	When the Academy of Arts demanded freedom
	Of artistic expression from narrow-minded bureaucrats
	There was a howl and a clamour in its immediate vicinity
	But roaring above everything
	Came a deafening thunder of applause
	From beyond the Sector boundary.
	Freedom! it roared. Freedom for the artists!
	Freedom all round! Freedom for all!
	Freedom for the exploiters! Freedom for the warmongers!
	Freedom for the Ruhr cartels! Freedom for Hitler’s generals!
	Softly, my dear fellows...
	The Judas kiss for the artists follows
	Hard on the Judas kiss for the workers.
	The arsonist with his bottle of petrol
	Sneaks up grinning to
	The Academy of Arts.
	But it was not to embrace him, just
	To knock the bottle out of his dirty hand that
	We asked for elbow room.
	Even the narrowest minds
	In which peace is harboured
	Are more welcome to the arts than the art lover
	
	Who is also a lover of the art of war.


11. ON THE TERM EXILE

	No need to drive a nail into the wall
	To hang your hat on;
	When you come in, just drop it on the chair
	No guest has sat on.
	
	Don’t worry about watering the flowers--
	In fact, don’t plant them.
	You will have gone back home before they bloom,
	And who will want them?
	
	If mastering the language is too hard,
	Only be patient;
	The telegram imploring your return
	Won’t need translation.
	
	Remember, when the ceiling sheds itself
	In flakes of plaster,
	The wall that keeps you out is crumbling too,
	As fast or faster.


12. PARTING

	We embrace. 
	Rich cloth under my fingers 
	While yours touch poor fabric. 
	A quick embrace 
	You were invited for dinner 
	While the minions of law are after me. 
	We talk about the weather and our 
	Lasting friendship. Anything else 
	Would be too bitter.


13. THE PLUM TREE

	In the courtyard stands a plum tree,
	It’s so small, no one believes it.
	It has a fence around it,
	So no one can stomp on it.
	The little tree can’t grow,
	Yes--it wants to grow!
	No one talks about it;
	It gets too little sun.
	
	No one believes it’s a plum tree
	Because it doesn’t have a single plum.
	But it is a plum tree;
	You can tell by its leaf.


14. POOR B. B. 

	1
	
	I, Bertolt Brecht, come from the black forests.
	My mother carried me into the cities
	When I was in her belly. And the chill of the forests
	Will be in me till my dying day.
	
	
	2
	
	The asphalt city is my home. Furnished
	From the outset with every sacramental perquisite:
	With newspapers. And tobacco. And brandy.
	Distrustful and idle and contented to the end.
	
	
	3
	
	I am friendly to people. I put on
	A top hat because that’s what they do.
	I tell myself: They are animals with a particular smell.
	And I tell myself: What of it, so am I.
	
	
	4
	
	In the morning I like to set a woman or two
	In my empty rocking chairs
	And I look at them insouciantly and I say to them:
	In me you have someone on whom there is no relying.
	
	
	5
	
	Towards evening it’s men I gather round about me
	And we address our company as gentlemen.
	They park their feet on my table
	And say: Things are looking up. And I don’t ask: When?


15. QUESTIONS

	Write me what you’re wearing! Is it warm?
	Write me how you lie! Do you lie there softly?
	Write me how you look! Is it still the same?
	Write me what you’re missing! Is it my arm?
	
	Write me how you are! Have you been spared?
	Write me what they’re doing! Do you have enough courage?
	Write me what you’re doing! Is it good?
	Write me, who are you thinking of? Is it me?
	
	Freely, I’ve given you only my questions.
	And I hear the answers, how they fall.
	When you’re tired, I can’t carry it for you.
	
	If you’re hungry, I have nothing for you to eat.
	And so now I leave the world
	No longer there, as if I’ve forgotten you.


16. SEND ME A LEAF

	Send me a leaf, but from a bush
	That grows at least one half hour
	Away from your house, then
	You must go and will be strong, and I
	Thank you for the pretty leaf.


17. SONG OF THE STORM TROOPER

	From hunger I grew drowsy,
	Dulled by my belly’s ache.
	Then someone shouted in my ear,
	Germany awake.
	
	Then I saw many marching
	Toward the Third Reich, they said.
	Since 1 had naught to lose
	I followed where they led.
	
	And as I marched, there marched
	Big Belly by my side.
	When I shouted “Bread and jobs,”
	“Bread and jobs,” he cried.
	
	The leader wore high boots,
	I stumbled with wet feet
	Yet all of us were marching
	To the selfsame beat.
	
	I wanted to march leftward,
	Squads right, the order was.
	I blindly followed orders
	For better or for worse.
	
	And toward some new Third Reich,
	But scarcely knowing whither,
	Pale and hungry men
	And well-fed marched together.
	
	They gave me a revolver
	And said: now shoot our foe.
	But as I fired on his ranks
	I laid my brother low.
	
	It was my brother, hunger
	Made us one, I know,
	And I am marching, marching
	With my own and my brother’s foe.
	
	So I have lost my brother,
	I wove his winding sheet.
	I know now by this victory
	I wrought my own defeat.


18. THE SWAMP

	I beheld many friends, and the friend I loved the most,
	helplessly sink into the swamp
	I pass by daily.
	
	And a drowning was not over in a single morning.
	Often it took
	many weeks; this made it more terrible.
	And the memory of our long
	agreeing talks about the swamp, which already
	held so many.
	Powerless now I saw him leaning back
	covered with leeches
	in the shimmering
	softly moving slime. Upon the sinking
	face the ghastly
	blissful smile.


19. TO POSTERITY

	I
	
	Indeed I live in the dark ages!
	A guileless word is an absurdity. A smooth forehead betokens
	A hard heart. He who laughs
	Has not yet heard
	The terrible tidings.
	
	Ah, what an age it is
	When to speak of trees is almost a crime
	For it is a kind of silence about injustice!
	And he who walks calmly across the street,
	Is he not out of reach of his friends
	In trouble?
	
	It is true: I earn my living
	But, believe me, it is only an accident.
	Nothing that I do entitles me to eat my fill.
	By chance I was spared. (If my luck leaves me
	I am lost.)
	
	They tell me: eat and drink. Be glad you have it!
	But how can I eat and drink
	When my food is snatched from the hungry
	And my glass of water belongs to the thirsty?
	And yet I eat and drink.
	
	I would gladly be wise.
	The old books tell us what wisdom is:
	Avoid the strife of the world
	Live out your little time
	Fearing no one
	Using no violence
	Returning good for evil--
	Not fulfillment of desire but forgetfulness
	Passes for wisdom.
	I can do none of this:
	Indeed I live in the dark ages!
	
	
	II
	
	I came to the cities in a time of disorder
	When hunger ruled.
	I came among men in a time of uprising
	And I revolted with them.
	So the time passed away
	Which on earth was given me.
	
	I ate my food between massacres.
	The shadow of murder lay upon my sleep.
	And when I loved, I loved with indifference.
	I looked upon nature with impatience.
	So the time passed away
	Which on earth was given me.
	
	In my time streets led to the quicksand.
	Speech betrayed me to the slaughterer.
	There was little I could do. But without me
	The rulers would have been more secure. This was my hope.
	So the time passed away
	Which on earth was given me.
	
	
	III
	
	You, who shall emerge from the flood
	In which we are sinking,
	Think--
	When you speak of our weaknesses,
	Also of the dark time
	That brought them forth.
	
	For we went, changing our country more often than our shoes.
	In the class war, despairing
	When there was only injustice and no resistance.
	
	For we knew only too well:
	Even the hatred of squalor
	Makes the brow grow stern.
	Even anger against injustice
	Makes the voice grow harsh. Alas, we
	Who wished to lay the foundations of kindness
	Could not ourselves be kind.
	
	But you, when at last it comes to pass
	That man can help his fellow man,
	Do no judge us
	Too harshly.


20. TO THOSE BORN AFTER

	I
	
	To the cities I came in a time of disorder
	That was ruled by hunger.
	I sheltered with the people in a time of uproar
	And then I joined in their rebellion.
	That’s how I passed my time that was given to me on this Earth.
	
	I ate my dinners between the battles,
	I lay down to sleep among the murderers,
	I didn’t care for much for love
	And for nature’s beauties I had little patience.
	That’s how I passed my time that was given to me on this Earth.
	
	The city streets all led to foul swamps in my time,
	My speech betrayed me to the butchers.
	I could do only little
	But without me those that ruled could not sleep so easily:
	That’s what I hoped.
	That’s how I passed my time that was given to me on this Earth.
	
	Our forces were slight and small,
	Our goal lay in the far distance
	Clearly in our sights,
	If for me myself beyond my reaching.
	That’s how I passed my time that was given to me on this Earth.
	
	
	II
	
	You who will come to the surface
	From the flood that’s overwhelmed us and drowned us all
	Must think, when you speak of our weakness in times of darkness
	That you’ve not had to face:
	
	Days when we were used to changing countries
	More often than shoes,
	Through the war of the classes despairing
	That there was only injustice and no outrage.
	
	Even so we realised
	Hatred of oppression still distorts the features,
	Anger at injustice still makes voices raised and ugly.
	Oh we, who wished to lay for the foundations for peace and friendliness,
	Could never be friendly ourselves.
	
	And in the future when no longer
	Do human beings still treat themselves as animals,
	Look back on us with indulgence.


21. WHAT HAS HAPPENED?

	The industrialist is having his aeroplane serviced.
	The priest is wondering what he said in his sermon eight weeks ago
	about tithes.
	The generals are putting on civvies and looking like bank clerks.
	Public officials are getting friendly.
	The policeman points out the way to the man in the cloth cap.
	The landlord comes to see whether the water supply is working.
	The journalists write the word People with capital letters.
	The singers sing at the opera for nothing.
	Ships’ captains check the food in the crew’s galley,
	Car owners get in beside their chauffeurs.
	Doctors sue the insurance companies.
	Scholars show their discoveries and hide their decorations.
	Farmers deliver potatoes to the barracks.
	The revolution has won its first battle:
	That’s what has happened.


22. WHEN I’D REPORTED TO THE COUPLE THUS

	_The Augsburger walks with Dante through the hell of the departed. He addresses the inconsolable and reports to them that on earth some things have changed._
	
	When I’d reported to the couple, thus
	That up there no one murders now for gain
	Since no one owns a thing, the faithless spouse
	
	Who’d beguiled that woman so improperly
	Lifted his hand, now tied to hers by chains
	And looked at her and turned perplexed to me
	
	So no one steals, if  there’s no property?
	I shook my head. And as their hands just touched
	I saw a blush suffuse the woman’s cheeks.
	
	He saw it too and cried, She hasn’t once
	Shown so much since the day she was seduced!
	And murmuring, Then there’s no abstinence?
	
	They moved off swiftly. And the ties that fused
	Them tight were of no weight or consequence.


23. A WORKER READS HISTORY

	Who built the seven gates of Thebes?
	The books are filled with names of kings.
	Was it the kings who hauled the craggy blocks of stone?
	And Babylon, so many times destroyed.
	Who built the city up each time? In which of Lima’s houses,
	That city glittering with gold, lived those who built it?
	In the evening when the Chinese wall was finished
	Where did the masons go? Imperial Rome
	Is full of arcs of triumph. Who reared them up? Over whom
	Did the Caesars triumph? Byzantium lives in song.
	Were all her dwellings palaces? And even in Atlantis of the legend
	The night the seas rushed in,
	The drowning men still bellowed for their slaves.
	
	Young Alexander conquered India.
	He alone?
	Caesar beat the Gauls.
	Was there not even a cook in his army?
	Phillip of Spain wept as his fleet
	was sunk and destroyed. Were there no other tears?
	Frederick the Great triumphed in the Seven Years War.
	Who triumphed with him?
	
	Each page a victory
	At whose expense the victory ball?
	Every ten years a great man,
	Who paid the piper?
	
	So many particulars.
	So many questions.
