*** José Martí (1853 - 1895)


1. THE GIRL OF GUATEMALA

	I want, in the shadow of a wing,
	tell this tale in bloom:
	the girl from Guatemala,
	the one who died of love.
	
	The bouquets were made of lilies;
	and the borders of reseda
	and jasmine; we buried her
	in a silk box;
	
	She gave the forgetful
	a scent pad;
	he came back, he came back married;
	she died of love.
	
	They were carrying it on litters
	bishops and ambassadors;
	the people went behind in batches,
	all loaded with flowers;
	
	She, to see him again,
	He went out to see him at the viewpoint;
	he returned to his wife,
	she died of love.
	
	Like hot bronze,
	to the goodbye kiss,
	it was his forehead--the forehead
	that I have loved the most in my life!
	
	He entered the river late at night,
	the doctor took her out dead;
	they say he died of cold,
	I know that he died of love.
	
	There in the frozen vault
	they put it on two benches:
	I kissed his sharp hand
	I kissed his white shoes.
	
	Quiet, at dusk,
	The undertaker called me;
	I have never seen again
	to which he died of love.


2. THE TWO PRINCES

	The palace is in mourning,
	The king cries on his throne;
	The queen is also crying,
	She’s crying all alone.
	In handkerchiefs of pure lace
	They cry in disbelief,
	The nobles of the palace,
	Beside themselves with grief.
	The royal horses, once so bright,
	Are now in black-array:
	The horses did not eat last night--
	Nor wanted food today.
	The courtyard’s stately laurel tree
	Is stripped of all its leaves:
	The people of the country
	All carry laurel wreaths.
	The king’s son has died today:
	The king’s heir has passed away.
	
	Upon the hill, the shepherd
	Has built his simple home:
	The shepherdess to ask is heard:
	“Why does the sun still come?”
	With lowered heads, the sheep
	Approach the shepherd’s door:
	A box he’s lining, long and deep,
	Upon the cottage floor.
	A sad dog keeps watch there;
	From the hut is heard a moan:
	“Little bird, take me where
	My precious one has flown.”
	The weeping shepherd takes the spade,
	And sinks it in the bower,
	And in the hole that he has made
	The shepherd lays his flower.
	The shepherd’s son has died today,
	The shepherd’s heir has passed away.
