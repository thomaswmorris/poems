*** Gabriela Mistral (1889 - 1957)


1. I AM NOT ALONE

	The night, it is deserted
	from the mountains to the sea.
	But I, the one who rocks you,
	I am not alone!

	The sky, it is deserted
	for the moon falls to the sea.
	But I, the one who holds you,
	I am not alone!

	The world, it is deserted.
	All flesh is sad you see.
	But I, the one who hugs you,
	I am not alone!



2. THE SAD MOTHER

	Sleep, sleep, my beloved,
	without worry, without fear,
	although my soul does not sleep,
	although I do not rest.

	Sleep, sleep, and in the night
	may your whispers be softer
	than a leaf of grass,
	or the silken fleece of lambs.

	May my flesh slumber in you,
	my worry, my trembling.
	In you, may my eyes close
	and my heart sleep.



3. SONG OF DEATH

	Old Woman Census-taker,
	Death the Trickster,
	when you’re going along,
	don’t you meet my baby.

	Sniffing at newborns,
	smelling for the milk,
	find salt, find cornmeal,
	don’t find my milk.

	Anti-Mother of the world,
	People-Collector--
	on the beaches and byways,
	don’t meet that child.

	The name he was baptized,
	that flower he grows with,
	forget it, Rememberer.
	Lose it, Death.

	Let wind and salt and sand
	drive you crazy, mix you up
	so you can’t tell
	East from West,

	or mother from child,
	like fish in the sea.
	And on the day, at the hour,
	find only me.



4. THOSE WHO DO NOT DANCE

	A crippled child
	Said, “How shall I dance?”
	Let your heart dance
	We said.

	Then the invalid said:
	“How shall I sing?”
	Let your heart sing
	We said

	Then spoke the poor dead thistle,
	But I, how shall I dance?”
	Let your heart fly to the wind
	We said.

	Then God spoke from above
	“How shall I descend from the blue?”
	Come dance for us here in the light
	We said.

	All the valley is dancing
	Together under the sun,
	And the heart of him who joins us not
	Is turned to dust, to dust.



5. TO SEE HIM AGAIN

	Never, never again?
	Not on nights filled with quivering stars,
	or during dawn’s maiden brightness
	or afternoons of sacrifice?

	Or at the edge of a pale path
	that encircles the farmlands,
	or upon the rim of a trembling fountain,
	whitened by a shimmering moon?

	Or beneath the forest’s
	luxuriant, raveled tresses
	where, calling his name,
	I was overtaken by the night?
	Not in the grotto that returns
	the echo of my cry?

	Oh no. To see him again--
	it would not matter where--
	in heaven’s deadwater
	or inside the boiling vortex,
	under serene moons or in bloodless fright!

	To be with him . . .
	every springtime and winter,
	united in one anguished knot
	around his bloody neck!
