*** Kenneth Slessor (1901 - 1971)


1. BEACH BURIAL

	Softly and humbly to the Gulf of Arabs
	The convoys of dead sailors come;
	At night they sway and wander in the waters far under,
	But morning rolls them in the foam.
	
	Between the sob and clubbing of gunfire
	Someone, it seems, has time for this,
	To pluck them from the shallows and bury them in burrows
	And tread the sand upon their nakedness;
	
	And each cross, the driven stake of tidewood,
	Bears the last signature of men,
	Written with such perplexity, with such bewildered pity,
	The words choke as they begin--
	
	“Unknown seaman”--the ghostly pencil
	Wavers and fades, the purple drips,
	The breath of wet season has washed their inscriptions
	As blue as drowned men’s lips,
	
	Dead seamen, gone in search of the same landfall,
	Whether as ememies they fought,
	Or fought with us, or neither; the sand joins them together,
	Enlisted on the other front.


2. FIVE BELLS

	Time that is moved by little fidget wheels
	Is not my time, the flood that does not flow.
	Between the double and the single bell
	Of a ship’s hour, between a round of bells
	From the dark warship riding there below,
	I have lived many lives, and this one life
	Of Joe, long dead, who lives between five bells.
	
	Deep and dissolving verticals of light
	Ferry the falls of moonshine down. Five bells
	Coldly rung out in a machine’s voice. Night and water
	Pour to one rip of darkness, the Harbour floats
	In the air, the Cross hangs upside-down in water.
	
	Why do I think of you, dead man, why thieve
	These profitless lodgings from the flukes of thought
	Anchored in Time? You have gone from earth,
	Gone even from the meaning of a name;
	Yet something’s there, yet something forms its lips
	And hits and cries against the ports of space,
	Beating their sides to make its fury heard.
	
	Are you shouting at me, dead man, squeezing your face
	In agonies of speech on speechless panes?
	Cry louder, beat the windows, bawl your name!
	
	But I hear nothing, nothing...only bells,
	Five bells, the bumpkin calculus of Time.
	Your echoes die, your voice is dowsed by Life,
	There’s not a mouth can fly the pygmy strait -
	Nothing except the memory of some bones
	Long shoved away, and sucked away, in mud;
	And unimportant things you might have done,
	Or once I thought you did; but you forgot,
	And all have now forgotten - looks and words
	And slops of beer; your coat with buttons off,
	Your gaunt chin and pricked eye, and raging tales
	Of Irish kings and English perfidy,
	And dirtier perfidy of publicans
	Groaning to God from Darlinghurst.
	Five bells.
	
	Then I saw the road, I heard the thunder
	Tumble, and felt the talons of the rain
	The night we came to Moorebank in slab-dark,
	So dark you bore no body, had no face,
	But a sheer voice that rattled out of air
	(As now you’d cry if I could break the glass),
	A voice that spoke beside me in the bush,
	Loud for a breath or bitten off by wind,
	Of Milton, melons, and the Rights of Man,
	And blowing flutes, and how Tahitian girls
	Are brown and angry-tongued, and Sydney girls
	Are white and angry-tongued, or so you’d found.
	But all I heard was words that didn’t join
	So Milton became melons, melons girls,
	And fifty mouths, it seemed, were out that night,
	And in each tree an Ear was bending down,
	Or something that had just run, gone behind the grass,
	When blank and bone-white, like a maniac’s thought,
	The naphtha-flash of lightning slit the sky,
	Knifing the dark with deathly photographs.
	There’s not so many with so poor a purse
	Or fierce a need, must fare by night like that,
	Five miles in darkness on a country track,
	But when you do, that’s what you think.
	Five bells.
	
	In Melbourne, your appetite had gone,
	Your angers too; they had been leeched away
	By the soft archery of summer rains
	And the sponge-paws of wetness, the slow damp
	That stuck the leaves of living, snailed the mind,
	And showed your bones, that had been sharp with rage,
	The sodden ectasies of rectitude.
	I thought of what you’d written in faint ink,
	Your journal with the sawn-off lock, that stayed behind
	With other things you left, all without use,
	All without meaning now, except a sign
	That someone had been living who now was dead:
	“At Labassa. Room 6 x 8
	On top of the tower; because of this, very dark
	And cold in winter. Everything has been stowed
	Into this room--500 books all shapes
	And colours, dealt across the floor
	And over sills and on the laps of chairs;
	Guns, photoes of many differant things
	And differant curioes that I obtained...”
	
	In Sydney, by the spent aquarium-flare
	Of penny gaslight on pink wallpaper,
	We argued about blowing up the world,
	But you were living backward, so each night
	You crept a moment closer to the breast,
	And they were living, all of them, those frames
	And shapes of flesh that had perplexed your youth,
	And most your father, the old man gone blind,
	With fingers always round a fiddle’s neck,
	That graveyard mason whose fair monuments
	And tablets cut with dreams of piety
	Rest on the bosoms of a thousand men
	Staked bone by bone, in quiet astonishment
	At cargoes they had never thought to bear,
	These funeral-cakes of sweet and sculptured stone.
	
	Where have you gone? The tide is over you,
	The turn of midnight water’s over you,
	As Time is over you, and mystery,
	And memory, the flood that does not flow.
	You have no suburb, like those easier dead
	In private berths of dissolution laid--
	The tide goes over, the waves ride over you
	And let their shadows down like shining hair,
	But they are Water; and the sea-pinks bend
	Like lilies in your teeth, but they are Weed;
	And you are only part of an Idea.
	I felt the wet push its black thumb-balls in,
	The night you died, I felt your eardrums crack,
	And the short agony, the longer dream,
	The Nothing that was neither long nor short;
	But I was bound, and could not go that way,
	But I was blind, and could not feel your hand.
	If I could find an answer, could only find
	Your meaning, or could say why you were here
	Who now are gone, what purpose gave you breath
	Or seized it back, might I not hear your voice?
	
	I looked out my window in the dark
	At waves with diamond quills and combs of light
	That arched their mackerel-backs and smacked the sand
	In the moon’s drench, that straight enormous glaze,
	And ships far off asleep, and Harbour-buoys
	Tossing their fireballs wearily each to each,
	And tried to hear your voice, but all I heard
	Was a boat’s whistle, and the scraping squeal
	Of seabirds’ voices far away, and bells,
	Five bells. Five bells coldly ringing out.
	Five bells.


3. MANGROVES

	These black bush-waters, heavy with crusted boughs
	Like plumes above dead captains, wake the mind . . .
	Uncounted kissing, unremembered vows,
	Nights long forgotten, moons too dark to find,
	Or stars too cold . . . all quick things that have fled
	Whilst these old bubbles uprise in older stone,
	Return like pale dead faces of children dead,
	Staring unfelt through doors for ever unknown.
	
	O silent ones that drink these timeless pools,
	Eternal brothers, bending so deeply over,
	Your branches tremble above my tears again...
	And even my songs are stolen from some old lover
	Who cried beneath your leaves like other fools,
	While still they whisper “in vain . . .
	in vain . . . in vain . . .”


4. WILD GRAPES

	The old orchard, full of smoking air,
	Full of sour marsh and broken boughs, is there,
	But kept no more by vanished Mulligans,
	Or Hartigans, long drowned in earth themselves,
	Who gave this bitter fruit their care.
	
	Here’s where the cherries grew that birds forgot,
	And apples bright as dogstars; now there is not
	An apple or a cherry; only grapes,
	But wild ones, Isabella grapes they’re called,
	Small, pointed, black, like boughs of musket-shot.
	
	Eating their flesh, half-savage with black fur.
	Acid and gipsy-sweet, I thought of her,
	Isabella, the dead girl, who has lingered on
	Defiantly when all have gone away,
	In an old orchard where swallows never stir.
	
	Isabella grapes, outlaws of a strange bough,
	That in their harsh sweetness remind me somehow
	Of dark hair swinging and silver pins,
	A girl half-fierce, half-melting, as these grapes,
	Kissed here--or killed here--but who remembers now?


5. WINTER DAWN

	At five I wake, rise, rub on the smoking pane
	A port to see—water breathing in the air,
	Boughs broken. The sun comes up in a golden stain,
	Floats like a glassy sea-fruit. There is mist everywhere,
	White and humid, and the Harbour is like plated stone,
	Dull flakes of ice. One light drips out alone,
	One bead of winter-red, smouldering in the steam,
	Quietly over the roof-tops—another window
	Touched with a crystal fire in the sun’s gullies,
	One lonely star of the morning, where no stars gleam.
	
	Far away on the rim of this great misty cup,
	The sun gilds the dead suburbs as he rises up,
	Diamonds the wind-cocks, makes glitter the crusted spikes
	On moss-drowned gables. Now the tiles drip scarlet-wet,
	Swim like birds’ paving-stones, and sunlight strikes
	Their watery mirrors with a moister rivulet,
	Acid and cold. Here lie those mummied Kings,
	Men sleeping in houses, embalmed in stony coffins,
	Till the Last Trumpet calls their galleries up,
	And the suburbs rise with distant murmurings.
	
	O buried dolls, O men sleeping invisible there,
	I stare above your mounds of stone, lean down,
	Marooned and lonely in this bitter air,
	And in one moment deny your frozen town,
	Renounce your bodies—earth falls in clouds away,
	Stones lose their meaning, substance is lost in clay,
	Roofs fade, and that small smoking forgotten heap,
	The city, dissolves to a shell of bricks and paper,
	Empty, without purpose, a thing not comprehended,
	A broken tomb, where ghosts unknown sleep.
	
	And the least crystal weed, shaken with frost,
	The furred herbs of silver, the daisies round-eyed and tart,
	Painted in antic china, the smallest night-flower tossed
	Like a bright penny on the lawn, stirs more my heart,
	Strikes deeper this morning air, than mortal towers
	Dried to a common blindness, fainter than flowers,
	Fordone, extinguished, as the vapours break,
	And dead in the dawn. O Sun that kills with life,
	And brings to breath all silent things—O Dawn,
	Waken me with old earth, keep me awake!
