*** Thomas Hardy (1840 - 1928)


1. AFTER A JOURNEY

	Hereto I come to view a voiceless ghost;
	Whither, O whither will its whim now draw me?
	Up the cliff, down, till I’m lonely, lost,
	And the unseen waters’ ejaculations awe me.
	Where you will next be there’s no knowing,
	Facing round about me everywhere,
	With your nut-coloured hair,
	And gray eyes, and rose-flush coming and going.
	
	Yes: I have re-entered your olden haunts at last;
	Through the years, through the dead scenes I have tracked you;
	What have you now found to say of our past--
	Viewed across the dark space wherein I have lacked you?
	Summer gave us sweets, but autumn wrought division?
	Things were not lastly as firstly well
	With us twain, you tell?
	But all’s closed now, despite Time’s derision.
	
	I see what you are doing: you are leading me on
	To the spots we knew when we haunted here together,
	The waterfall, above which the mist-bow shone
	At the then fair hour in the then fair weather,
	And the cave just under, with a voice still so hollow
	That it seems to call out to me from forty years ago,
	When you were all aglow,
	And not the thin ghost that I now frailly follow!
	
	Ignorant of what there is flitting here to see,
	The waked birds preen and the seals flop lazily,
	Soon you will have, Dear, to vanish from me,
	For the stars close their shutters and the dawn whitens hazily.
	Trust me, I mind not, though Life lours,
	The bringing me here; nay, bring me here again!
	I am just the same as when
	Our days were a joy, and our paths through flowers.


2. AND THERE WAS A GREAT CALM

	I
	
	There had been years of Passion—scorching, cold,
	And much Despair, and Anger heaving high,
	Care whitely watching, Sorrows manifold,
	Among the young, among the weak and old,
	And the pensive Spirit of Pity whispered, “Why?”
	
	
	II
	
	Men had not paused to answer. Foes distraught
	Pierced the thinned peoples in a brute-like blindness,
	Philosophies that sages long had taught,
	And Selflessness, were as an unknown thought,
	And “Hell!” and “Shell!” were yapped at Lovingkindness.
	
	
	III
	
	The feeble folk at home had grown full-used
	To ‘dug-outs’, ‘snipers’, ‘Huns’, from the war-adept
	In the mornings heard, and at evetides perused;
	To day-dreamt men in millions, when they mused--
	To nightmare-men in millions when they slept.
	
	
	IV
	
	Waking to wish existence timeless, null,
	Sirius they watched above where armies fell;
	He seemed to check his flapping when, in the lull
	Of night a boom came thencewise, like the dull
	Plunge of a stone dropped into some deep well.
	
	
	V
	
	So, when old hopes that earth was bettering slowly
	Were dead and damned, there sounded ‘War is done!’
	One morrow. Said the bereft, and meek, and lowly,
	‘Will men some day be given to grace? yea, wholly,
	And in good sooth, as our dreams used to run?’
	
	
	VI
	
	Breathless they paused. Out there men raised their glance
	To where had stood those poplars lank and lopped,
	As they had raised it through the four years’ dance
	Of Death in the now familiar flats of France;
	And murmured, ‘Strange, this! How? All firing stopped?’
	
	
	VII
	
	Aye; all was hushed. The about-to-fire fired not,
	The aimed-at moved away in trance-lipped song.
	One checkless regiment slung a clinching shot
	And turned. The Spirit of Irony smirked out, ‘What?
	Spoil peradventures woven of Rage and Wrong?’
	
	
	VIII
	
	Thenceforth no flying fires inflamed the gray,
	No hurtlings shook the dewdrop from the thorn,
	No moan perplexed the mute bird on the spray;
	Worn horses mused: ‘We are not whipped to-day;’
	No weft-winged engines blurred the moon’s thin horn.
	
	
	IX
	
	Calm fell. From Heaven distilled a clemency;
	There was peace on earth, and silence in the sky;
	Some could, some could not, shake off misery:
	The Sinister Spirit sneered: ‘It had to be!’
	And again the Spirit of Pity whispered, ‘Why?’


3. BEFORE MARCHING AND AFTER

	      Orion swung southward aslant
	      Where the starved Egdon pine-trees had thinned,
	      The Pleiads aloft seemed to pant
	      With the heather that twitched in the wind;
	But he looked on indifferent to sights such as these,
	Unswayed by love, friendship, home joy or home sorrow,
	And wondered to what he would march on the morrow.
	
	      The crazed household-clock with its whirr
	      Rang midnight within as he stood,
	      He heard the low sighing of her
	      Who had striven from his birth for his good;
	But he still only asked the spring starlight, the breeze,
	What great thing or small thing his history would borrow
	From that Game with Death he would play on the morrow.
	
	      When the heath wore the robe of late summer,
	      And the fuchsia-bells, hot in the sun,
	      Hung red by the door, a quick comer
	      Brought tidings that marching was done
	For him who had joined in that game overseas
	Where Death stood to win, though his name was to borrow
	A brightness therefrom not to fade on the morrow.


4. A BROKEN APPOINTMENT

	You did not come, 
	And marching Time drew on, and wore me numb,--
	Yet less for loss of your dear presence there 
	Than that I thus found lacking in your make 
	That high compassion which can overbear 
	Reluctance for pure lovingkindness’ sake 
	Grieved I, when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum, 
	You did not come. 
	
	You love not me, 
	And love alone can lend you loyalty; 
	--I know and knew it. But, unto the store 
	Of human deeds divine in all but name, 
	Was it not worth a little hour or more 
	To add yet this: Once you, a woman, came 
	To soothe a time-torn man; even though it be 
	You love not me? 


5. IN TENEBRIS

	_“Percussus sum sicut foenum, et aruit cor meum.”_ -—Ps. _ci._
	
	Wintertime nighs; 
	But my bereavement-pain 
	It cannot bring again: 
	Twice no one dies. 
	
	Flower-petals flee; 
	But, since it once hath been, 
	No more that severing scene 
	Can harrow me. 
	
	Birds faint in dread: 
	I shall not lose old strength 
	In the lone frost’s black length: 
	Strength long since fled! 
	
	Leaves freeze to dun; 
	But friends can not turn cold 
	This season as of old 
	For him with none. 
	
	Tempests may scath; 
	But love can not make smart 
	Again this year his heart 
	Who no heart hath. 
	
	Black is night’s cope; 
	But death will not appal 
	One who, past doubtings all, 
	Waits in unhope. 


6. THE LAST PERFORMANCE

	“I am playing my oldest tunes,” declared she,
	     “All the old tunes I know,--
	Those I learnt ever so long ago.”
	--Why she should think just then she’d play them
	      Silence cloaks like snow.
	
	When I returned from the town at nightfall
	     Notes continued to pour
	As when I had left two hours before:
	“It’s the very last time,” she said in closing;
	      “From now I play no more.”
	
	A few morns onward found her fading,
	     And, as her life outflew,
	I thought of her playing her tunes right through;
	And I felt she had known of what was coming,
	     And wondered how she knew.


7. MEN WHO MARCH AWAY

	What of the faith and fire within us
	Men who march away
	Ere the barn-cocks say
	Night is growing gray,
	Leaving all that here can win us;
	What of the faith and fire within us
	Men who march away?
	
	Is it a purblind prank, O think you,
	Friend with the musing eye,
	Who watch us stepping by
	With doubt and dolorous sigh?
	Can much pondering so hoodwink you!
	Is it a purblind prank, O think you,
	Friend with the musing eye?
	
	Nay. We well see what we are doing,
	Though some may not see--
	Dalliers as they be--
	England’s need are we;
	Her distress would leave us rueing:
	Nay. We well see what we are doing,
	Though some may not see!
	
	In our heart of hearts believing
	Victory crowns the just,
	And that braggarts must
	Surely bite the dust,
	Press we to the field ungrieving,
	In our heart of hearts believing
	Victory crowns the just.
	
	Hence the faith and fire within us
	Men who march away
	Ere the barn-cocks say
	Night is growing gray,
	Leaving all that here can win us;
	Hence the faith and fire within us
	Men who march away.


8. A NEW YEAR’S EVE IN WAR TIME

	                         I
	
	           Phantasmal fears, 
	           And the flap of the flame, 
	           And the throb of the clock, 
	           And a loosened slate, 
	           And the blind night’s drone, 
	Which tiredly the spectral pines intone! 
	
	
	                         II
	
	           And the blood in my ears 
	           Strumming always the same, 
	           And the gable-cock 
	           With its fitful grate, 
	           And myself, alone.
	
	
	                        III
	
	           The twelfth hour nears 
	           Hand-hid, as in shame; 
	           I undo the lock, 
	           And listen, and wait 
	           For the Young Unknown. 
	
	
	                        IV
	
	           In the dark there careers--
	           As if Death astride came 
	           To numb all with his knock-- 
	           A horse at mad rate 
	           Over rut and stone. 
	
	
	                        V
	
	           No figure appears, 
	           No call of my name, 
	           No sound but ‘Tic-toc’ 
	           Without check. Past the gate 
	           It clatters--is gone. 
	
	
	                        VI
	
	           What rider it bears 
	           There is none to proclaim; 
	           And the Old Year has struck,
	           And, scarce animate, 
	           The New makes moan. 
	
	
	                        VII.
	
	           Maybe that ‘More Tears!-- 
	           More Famine and Flame-- 
	           More Severance and Shock!‘ 
	           Is the order from Fate 
	           That the Rider speeds on 
	To pale Europe; and tiredly the pines intone.


9. THE OXEN

	Christmas Eve, and twelve of the clock.
	“Now they are all on their knees,”
	An elder said as we sat in a flock
	By the embers in hearthside ease.
	
	We pictured the meek mild creatures where
	They dwelt in their strawy pen,
	Nor did it occur to one of us there
	To doubt they were kneeling then.
	
	So fair a fancy few would weave
	In these years! Yet, I feel,
	If someone said on Christmas Eve,
	“Come; see the oxen kneel,
	
	“In the lonely barton by yonder coomb
	Our childhood used to know,”
	I should go with him in the gloom,
	Hoping it might be so.


10. RAIN ON A GRAVE

	Clouds spout upon her 
	Their waters amain 
	In ruthless disdain,-- 
	Her who but lately 
	Had shivered with pain 
	As at touch of dishonour 
	If there had lit on her 
	So coldly, so straightly 
	Such arrows of rain: 
	
	One who to shelter 
	Her delicate head 
	Would quicken and quicken 
	Each tentative tread 
	If drops chanced to pelt her 
	That summertime spills 
	In dust-paven rills 
	When thunder-clouds thicken 
	And birds close their bills. 
	
	Would that I lay there 
	And she were housed here! 
	Or better, together 
	Were folded away there 
	Exposed to one weather 
	We both,--who would stray there 
	When sunny the day there, 
	Or evening was clear 
	At the prime of the year. 
	
	Soon will be growing 
	Green blades from her mound, 
	And daisies be showing 
	Like stars on the ground, 
	Till she form part of them-- 
	Ay--the sweet heart of them, 
	Loved beyond measure 
	With a child’s pleasure 
	All her life’s round. 


11. THE SELF-UNSEEING

	Here is the ancient floor, 
	Footworn and hollowed and thin, 
	Here was the former door 
	Where the dead feet walked in. 
	
	She sat here in her chair, 
	Smiling into the fire; 
	He who played stood there, 
	Bowing it higher and higher. 
	
	Childlike, I danced in a dream; 
	Blessings emblazoned that day; 
	Everything glowed with a gleam; 
	Yet we were looking away! 


12. THE TO-BE-FORGOTTEN

	I
	
	I heard a small sad sound, 
	And stood awhile among the tombs around: 
	“Wherefore, old friends,“ said I, “are you distrest, 
	Now, screened from life’s unrest?“ 
	
	
	II
	
	--“O not at being here; 
	But that our future second death is near; 
	When, with the living, memory of us numbs, 
	And blank oblivion comes! 
	
	
	III
	
	“These, our sped ancestry, 
	Lie here embraced by deeper death than we; 
	Nor shape nor thought of theirs can you descry 
	With keenest backward eye. 
	
	
	IV
	
	“They count as quite forgot; 
	They are as men who have existed not; 
	Theirs is a loss past loss of fitful breath; 
	It is the second death. 
	
	
	V
	
	“We here, as yet, each day 
	Are blest with dear recall; as yet, can say 
	We hold in some soul loved continuance 
	Of shape and voice and glance. 
	
	
	VI
	
	“But what has been will be--
	First memory, then oblivion’s swallowing sea; 
	Like men foregone, shall we merge into those 
	Whose story no one knows. 
	
	
	VII
	
	“For which of us could hope 
	To show in life that world-awakening scope 
	Granted the few whose memory none lets die, 
	But all men magnify? 
	
	
	VIII
	
	“We were but Fortune’s sport; 
	Things true, things lovely, things of good report 
	We neither shunned nor sought . . . We see our bourne, 
	And seeing it we mourn.“ 


13. THE VOICE

	Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me, 
	Saying that now you are not as you were 
	When you had changed from the one who was all to me, 
	But as at first, when our day was fair. 
	
	Can it be you that I hear? Let me view you, then, 
	Standing as when I drew near to the town 
	Where you would wait for me: yes, as I knew you then, 
	Even to the original air-blue gown! 
	
	Or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness 
	Travelling across the wet mead to me here, 
	You being ever dissolved to wan wistlessness, 
	Heard no more again far or near? 
	
	Thus I; faltering forward, 
	Leaves around me falling, 
	Wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward, 
	And the woman calling.
