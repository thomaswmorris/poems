*** William Blake (1757 - 1827)


1. (FROM) A MEMORABLE FANCY

	As I was walking among the fires of Hell, delighted with the enjoyments
	of Genius, which to Angels look like torment and insanity, I collected
	some of their proverbs, thinking that as the sayings used in a nation
	mark its character, so the proverbs of Hell show the nature of infernal
	wisdom better than any description of buildings or garments.
	
	When I came home, on the abyss of the five senses, where a flat-sided
	steep frowns over the present world, I saw a mighty Devil folded in
	black clouds hovering on the sides of the rock; with corroding fires
	he wrote the following sentence now perceived by the minds of men, and
	read by them on earth:--
	
	   _“How do you know but every bird
	       that cuts the airy way
	   Is an immense world of delight,
	       closed by your senses five?”_


2. THE ANGEL

	I dreamt a dream!  What can it mean?
	And that I was a maiden Queen
	Guarded by an Angel mild:
	Witless woe was ne’er beguiled!
	
	And I wept both night and day,
	And he wiped my tears away;
	And I wept both day and night,
	And hid from him my heart’s delight.
	
	So he took his wings, and fled;
	Then the morn blushed rosy red.
	I dried my tears, and armed my fears
	With ten-thousand shields and spears.
	
	Soon my Angel came again;
	I was armed, he came in vain;
	For the time of youth was fled,
	And grey hairs were on my head.


3. THE ARGUMENT

	Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burden’d air,
	Hungry clouds swag on the deep.
	
	Once meek, and in a perilous path
	The just man kept his course along
	The Vale of Death.
	Roses are planted where thorns grow,
	And on the barren heath
	Sing the honey bees.
	
	Then the perilous path was planted,
	And a river and a spring
	On every cliff and tomb;
	And on the bleached bones
	Red clay brought forth:
	Till the villain left the paths of ease
	To walk in perilous paths, and drive
	The just man into barren climes.
	
	Now the sneaking serpent walks
	In mild humility;
	And the just man rages in the wilds
	Where lions roam.
	
	Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burden’d air,
	Hungry clouds swag on the deep.


4. THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER

	When my mother died I was very young,
	And my father sold me while yet my tongue
	Could scarcely cry “Weep! weep! weep! weep!”
	So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.
	
	There’s little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,
	That curled like a lamb’s back, was shaved; so I said,
	“Hush, Tom! never mind it, for, when your head’s bare,
	You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.”
	
	And so he was quiet, and that very night,
	As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight!--
	That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,
	Were all of them locked up in coffins of black.
	
	And by came an angel, who had a bright key,
	And he opened the coffins, and let them all free;
	Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run,
	And wash in a river, and shine in the sun.
	
	Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,
	They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind;
	And the Angel told Tom, if he’d be a good boy,
	He’d have God for his father, and never want joy.
	
	And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark,
	And got with our bags and our brushes to work.
	Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm:
	So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.


5. THE CLOD AND THE PEBBLE

	“Love seeketh not itself to please,
	 Nor for itself hath any care,
	But for another gives it ease,
	 And builds a heaven in hell’s despair.”
	
	So sang a little clod of clay,
	 Trodden with the cattle’s feet,
	But a pebble of the brook
	 Warbled out these metres meet:
	
	“Love seeketh only Self to please,
	 To bind another to its delight,
	Joys in another’s loss of ease,
	 And builds a hell in heaven’s despite.”


6. A DIVINE IMAGE

	Cruelty has a human heart,
	 And Jealousy a human face;
	Terror the human form divine,
	 And Secresy the human dress.
	
	The human dress is forged iron,
	 The human form a fiery forge,
	The human face a furnace sealed,
	 The human heart its hungry gorge.


7. DIVINE IMAGE

	To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
	 All pray in their distress,
	And to these virtues of delight
	 Return their thankfulness.
	
	For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
	 Is God our Father dear;
	And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
	 Is man, his child and care.
	
	For Mercy has a human heart
	 Pity, a human face;
	And Love, the human form divine;
	 And Peace, the human dress.
	
	Then every man, of every clime,
	 That prays in his distress,
	Prays to the human form divine:
	 Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.
	
	And all must love the human form,
	 In heathen, Turk, or Jew.
	Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell,
	 There God is dwelling too.


8. EARTH’S ANSWER

	Earth raised up her head
	From the darkness dread and drear,
	Her light fled,
	Stony, dread,
	And her locks covered with grey despair.
	
	“Prisoned on watery shore,
	Starry jealousy does keep my den
	Cold and hoar;
	Weeping o’er,
	I hear the father of the ancient men.
	
	“Selfish father of men!
	Cruel, jealous, selfish fear!
	Can delight,
	Chained in night,
	The virgins of youth and morning bear?
	
	“Does spring hide its joy,
	When buds and blossoms grow?
	Does the sower
	Sow by night,
	Or the plowman in darkness plough?
	
	“Break this heavy chain,
	That does freeze my bones around!
	Selfish, vain,
	Eternal bane,
	That free love with bondage bound.”


9. THE ECHOING GREEN

	The sun does arise,
	And make happy the skies;
	The merry bells ring
	To welcome the Spring;
	The skylark and thrush,
	The birds of the bush,
	Sing louder around
	To the bells’ cheerful sound;
	While our sports shall be seen
	On the echoing Green.
	
	Old John, with white hair,
	Does laugh away care,
	Sitting under the oak,
	Among the old folk.
	They laugh at our play,
	And soon they all say,
	“Such, such were the joys
	When we all--girls and boys--
	In our youth-time were seen
	On the echoing Green.”
	
	Till the little ones, weary,
	No more can be merry:
	The sun does descend,
	And our sports have an end.
	Round the laps of their mothers
	Many sisters and brothers,
	Like birds in their nest,
	Are ready for rest,
	And sport no more seen
	On the darkening green.


10. THE FLY

	Little Fly,
	Thy summer’s play
	My thoughtless hand
	Has brushed away.
	
	Am not I
	A fly like thee?
	Or art not thou
	A man like me?
	
	For I dance
	And drink, and sing,
	Till some blind hand
	Shall brush my wing.
	
	If thought is life
	And strength and breath
	And the want
	Of thought is death;
	
	Then am I
	A happy fly,
	If I live,
	Or if I die.


11. THE GARDEN OF LOVE

	I laid me down upon a bank,
	 Where Love lay sleeping;
	I heard among the rushes dank
	 Weeping, weeping.
	
	Then I went to the heath and the wild,
	 To the thistles and thorns of the waste;
	And they told me how they were beguiled,
	 Driven out, and compelled to the chaste.
	
	I went to the Garden of Love,
	 And saw what I never had seen;
	A Chapel was built in the midst,
	 Where I used to play on the green.
	
	And the gates of this Chapel were shut
	 And “Thou shalt not,“ writ over the door;
	So I turned to the Garden of Love
	 That so many sweet flowers bore.
	
	And I saw it was filled with graves,
	 And tombstones where flowers should be;
	And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,
	 And binding with briars my joys and desires.


12. HOLY THURSDAY

	Is this a holy thing to see
	 In a rich and fruitful land,--
	Babes reduced to misery,
	 Fed with cold and usurous hand?
	
	Is that trembling cry a song?
	 Can it be a song of joy?
	And so many children poor?
	 It is a land of poverty!
	
	And their son does never shine,
	 And their fields are bleak and bare,
	And their ways are filled with thorns:
	 It is eternal winter there.
	
	For where’er the sun does shine,
	 And where’er the rain does fall,
	Babes should never hunger there,
	 Nor poverty the mind appall.


13. THE HUMAN ABSTRACT

	Pity would be no more
	If we did not make somebody poor,
	And Mercy no more could be
	If all were as happy as we.
	
	And mutual fear brings Peace,
	Till the selfish loves increase;
	Then Cruelty knits a snare,
	And spreads his baits with care.
	
	He sits down with his holy fears,
	And waters the ground with tears;
	Then Humility takes its root
	Underneath his foot.
	
	Soon spreads the dismal shade
	Of Mystery over his head,
	And the caterpillar and fly
	Feed on the Mystery.
	
	And it bears the fruit of Deceit,
	Ruddy and sweet to eat,
	And the raven his nest has made
	In its thickest shade.
	
	The gods of the earth and sea
	Sought through nature to find this tree,
	But their search was all in vain:
	There grows one in the human Brain.


14. THE LAMB

	 Little Lamb, who made thee
	 Dost thou know who made thee,
	Gave thee life, and bid thee feed
	By the stream and o’er the mead;
	Gave thee clothing of delight,
	Softest clothing, woolly, bright;
	Gave thee such a tender voice,
	Making all the vales rejoice?
	 Little Lamb, who made thee?
	 Dost thou know who made thee?
	
	 Little Lamb, I’ll tell thee;
	 Little Lamb, I’ll tell thee:
	He is called by thy name,
	For He calls Himself a Lamb
	He is meek, and He is mild,
	He became a little child.
	I a child, and thou a lamb,
	We are called by His name.
	 Little Lamb, God bless thee!
	 Little Lamb, God bless thee!


15. LAUGHING SONG

	When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,
	And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;
	When the air does laugh with our merry wit,
	And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;
	
	when the meadows laugh with lively green,
	And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,
	When Mary and Susan and Emily
	With their sweet round mouths sing “Ha, ha he!”
	
	When the painted birds laugh in the shade,
	Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:
	Come live, and be merry, and join with me,
	To sing the sweet chorus of “Ha, ha, he!”


16. A LITTLE BOY LOST

	“Nought loves another as itself,
	 Nor venerates another so,
	Nor is it possible to thought
	 A greater than itself to know.
	
	“And, father, how can I love you
	 Or any of my brothers more?
	I love you like the little bird
	 That picks up crumbs around the door.”
	
	The Priest sat by and heard the child;
	 In trembling zeal he seized his hair,
	He led him by his little coat,
	 And all admired the priestly care.
	
	And standing on the altar high,
	 “Lo, what a fiend is here!“ said he:
	“One who sets reason up for judge
	 Of our most holy mystery.”
	
	The weeping child could not be heard,
	 The weeping parents wept in vain:
	They stripped him to his little shirt,
	 And bound him in an iron chain,
	
	And burned him in a holy place
	 Where many had been burned before;
	The weeping parents wept in vain.
	 Are such thing done on Albion’s shore?


17. THE LITTLE BOY LOST AND FOUND

	“Father, father, where are you going?
	 Oh do not walk so fast!
	Speak, father, speak to your little boy,
	 Or else I shall be lost.”
	
	The night was dark, no father was there,
	 The child was wet with dew;
	The mire was deep, and the child did weep,
	 And away the vapour flew.
	
	The little boy lost in the lonely fen,
	 Led by the wandering light,
	Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,
	 Appeared like his father, in white.
	
	He kissed the child, and by the hand led,
	 And to his mother brought,
	Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,
	 The little boy weeping sought.


18. THE LITTLE VAGABOND

	Dear mother, dear mother, the Church is cold;
	But the Alehouse is healthy, and pleasant, and warm.
	Besides, I can tell where I am used well;
	The poor parsons with wind like a blown bladder swell.
	
	But, if at the Church they would give us some ale,
	And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,
	We’d sing and we’d pray all the livelong day,
	Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray.
	
	Then the Parson might preach, and drink, and sing,
	And we’d be as happy as birds in the spring;
	And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church,
	Would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch.
	
	And God, like a father, rejoicing to see
	His children as pleasant and happy as he,
	Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel,
	But kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel.


19. LONDON

	I wandered through each chartered street,
	 Near where the chartered Thames does flow,
	A mark in every face I meet,
	 Marks of weakness, marks of woe.
	
	In every cry of every man,
	 In every infant’s cry of fear,
	In every voice, in every ban,
	 The mind-forged manacles I hear:
	
	How the chimney-sweeper’s cry
	 Every blackening church appalls,
	And the hapless soldier’s sigh
	 Runs in blood down palace-walls.
	
	But most, through midnight streets I hear
	 How the youthful harlot’s curse
	Blasts the new-born infant’s tear,
	 And blights with plagues the marriage-hearse.


20. MY PRETTY ROSE TREE

	A flower was offered to me,
	 Such a flower as May never bore;
	But I said “I’ve a pretty rose tree,”
	 And I passed the sweet flower o’er.
	
	Then I went to my pretty rose tree,
	 To tend her by day and by night;
	But my rose turned away with jealousy,
	 And her thorns were my only delight.


21. NIGHT

	The sun descending in the west,
	The evening star does shine;
	The birds are silent in their nest,
	And I must seek for mine.
	 The moon, like a flower
	 In heaven’s high bower,
	 With silent delight,
	 Sits and smiles on the night.
	
	Farewell, green fields and happy grove,
	Where flocks have ta’en delight.
	Where lambs have nibbled, silent move
	The feet of angels bright;
	 Unseen they pour blessing,
	 And joy without ceasing,
	 On each bud and blossom,
	 And each sleeping bosom.
	
	They look in every thoughtless nest
	Where birds are covered warm;
	They visit caves of every beast,
	To keep them all from harm:
	 If they see any weeping
	 That should have been sleeping,
	 They pour sleep on their head,
	 And sit down by their bed.
	
	When wolves and tigers howl for prey,
	They pitying stand and weep;
	Seeking to drive their thirst away,
	And keep them from the sheep.
	 But, if they rush dreadful,
	 The angels, most heedful,
	 Receive each mild spirit,
	 New worlds to inherit.
	
	And there the lion’s ruddy eyes
	Shall flow with tears of gold:
	And pitying the tender cries,
	And walking round the fold:
	 Saying: “Wrath by His meekness,
	 And, by His health, sickness,
	 Are driven away
	 From our immortal day.
	
	“And now beside thee, bleating lamb,
	I can lie down and sleep,
	Or think on Him who bore thy name,
	Graze after thee, and weep.
	 For, washed in life’s river,
	 My bright mane for ever
	 Shall shine like the gold,
	 As I guard o’er the fold.”


22. ON ANOTHER’S SORROW

	Can I see another’s woe,
	And not be in sorrow too?
	Can I see another’s grief,
	And not seek for kind relief?
	
	Can I see a falling tear,
	And not feel my sorrow’s share?
	Can a father see his child
	Weep, nor be with sorrow filled?
	
	Can a mother sit and hear
	An infant groan, an infant fear?
	No, no!  never can it be!
	Never, never can it be!
	
	And can He who smiles on all
	Hear the wren with sorrows small,
	Hear the small bird’s grief and care,
	Hear the woes that infants bear--
	
	And not sit beside the next,
	Pouring pity in their breast,
	And not sit the cradle near,
	Weeping tear on infant’s tear?
	
	And not sit both night and day,
	Wiping all our tears away?
	Oh no! never can it be!
	Never, never can it be!
	
	He doth give his joy to all:
	He becomes an infant small,
	He becomes a man of woe,
	He doth feel the sorrow too.
	
	Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,
	And thy Maker is not by:
	Think not thou canst weep a tear,
	And thy Maker is not near.
	
	Oh He gives to us his joy,
	That our grief He may destroy:
	Till our grief is fled an gone
	He doth sit by us and moan.


23. A POISON TREE

	I was angry with my friend:
	I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
	I was angry with my foe:
	I told it not, my wrath did grow.
	
	And I watered it in fears
	Night and morning with my tears,
	And I sunned it with smiles
	And with soft deceitful wiles.
	
	And it grew both day and night,
	Till it bore an apple bright,
	And my foe beheld it shine,
	and he knew that it was mine,--
	
	And into my garden stole
	When the night had veiled the pole;
	In the morning, glad, I see
	My foe outstretched beneath the tree.


24. PROVERBS OF HELL

	In seed-time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy.
	
	Drive your cart and your plough over the bones of the dead.
	
	The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.
	
	Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity.
	
	He who desires, but acts not, breeds pestilence.
	
	The cut worm forgives the plough.
	
	Dip him in the river who loves water.
	
	A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.
	
	He whose face gives no light shall never become a star.
	
	Eternity is in love with the productions of time.
	
	The busy bee has no time for sorrow.
	
	The hours of folly are measured by the clock, but of wisdom no clock
	can measure.
	
	All wholesome food is caught without a net or a trap.
	
	Bring out number, weight, and measure in a year of dearth.
	
	No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings.
	
	A dead body revenges not injuries.
	
	The most sublime act is to set another before you.
	
	If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise.
	
	Folly is the cloak of knavery.
	
	Shame is Pride’s cloak.
	
	Prisons are built with stones of law, brothels with bricks of religion.
	
	The pride of the peacock is the glory of God.
	
	The lust of the goat is the bounty of God.
	
	The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.
	
	The nakedness of woman is the work of God.
	
	Excess of sorrow laughs, excess of joy weeps.
	
	The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy
	sea, and the destructive sword, are portions of Eternity too great for
	the eye of man.
	
	The fox condemns the trap, not himself.
	
	Joys impregnate, sorrows bring forth.
	
	Let man wear the fell of the lion, woman the fleece of the sheep.
	
	The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship.
	
	The selfish smiling fool and the sullen frowning fool shall be both
	thought wise that they may be a rod.
	
	What is now proved was once only imagined.
	
	The rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbit watch the roots; the lion, the
	tiger, the horse, the elephant watch the fruits.
	
	The cistern contains, the fountain overflows.
	
	One thought fills immensity.
	
	Always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man will avoid you.
	
	Everything possible to be believed is an image of truth.
	
	The eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn of the
	crow.
	
	The fox provides for himself, but God provides for the lion.
	
	Think in the morning, act in the noon, eat in the evening, sleep in the
	night.
	
	He who has suffered you to impose on him knows you.
	
	As the plough follows words, so God rewards prayers.
	
	The tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.
	
	Expect poison from the standing water.
	
	You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.
	
	Listen to the fool’s reproach; it is a kingly title.
	
	The eyes of fire, the nostrils of air, the mouth of water, the beard
	of earth.
	
	The weak in courage is strong in cunning.
	
	The apple tree never asks the beech how he shall grow, nor the lion the
	horse how he shall take his prey.
	
	The thankful receiver bears a plentiful harvest.
	
	If others had not been foolish we should have been so.
	
	The soul of sweet delight can never be defiled.
	
	When thou seest an eagle, thou seest a portion of Genius. Lift up thy
	head!
	
	As the caterpillar chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so
	the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys.
	
	To create a little flower is the labour of ages.
	
	Damn braces; bless relaxes.
	
	The best wine is the oldest, the best water the newest.
	
	Prayers plough not; praises reap not; joys laugh not; sorrows weep not.
	
	The head Sublime, the heart Pathos, the genitals Beauty, the hands and
	feet Proportion.
	
	As the air to a bird, or the sea to a fish, so is contempt to the
	contemptible.
	
	The crow wished everything was black; the owl that everything was white.
	
	Exuberance is Beauty.
	
	If the lion was advised by the fox, he would be cunning.
	
	Improvement makes straight roads, but the crooked roads without
	Improvement are roads of Genius.
	
	Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires.
	
	Where man is not, nature is barren.
	
	Truth can never be told so as to be understood and not to be believed.
	
	Enough! or Too much.


25. THE SCHOOLBOY

	I love to rise on a summer morn,
	 When birds are singing on every tree;
	The distant huntsman winds his horn,
	 And the skylark sings with me:
	 Oh what sweet company!
	
	But to go to school in a summer morn,--
	 Oh it drives all joy away!
	Under a cruel eye outworn,
	 The little ones spend the day
	 In sighing and dismay.
	
	Ah then at times I drooping sit,
	 And spend many an anxious hour;
	Nor in my book can I take delight,
	 Nor sit in learning’s bower,
	 Worn through with the dreary shower.
	
	How can the bird that is born for joy
	 Sit in a cage and sing?
	How can a child, when fears annoy,
	 But droop his tender wing,
	 And forget his youthful spring?
	
	Oh father and mother, if buds are nipped,
	 And blossoms blown away;
	And if the tender plants are stripped
	 Of their joy in the springing day,
	 By sorrow and care’s dismay,--
	
	How shall the summer arise in joy,
	 Or the summer fruits appear?
	Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,
	 Or bless the mellowing year,
	 When the blasts of winter appear?


26. A SONG

	Sweet dreams, form a shade
	O’er my lovely infant’s head!
	Sweet dreams of pleasant streams
	By happy, silent, moony beams!
	
	Sweet Sleep, with soft down
	Weave thy brows an infant crown
	Sweet Sleep, angel mild,
	Hover o’er my happy child!
	
	Sweet smiles, in the night
	Hover over my delight!
	Sweet smiles, mother’s smile,
	All the livelong night beguile.
	
	Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,
	Chase not slumber from thine eyes!
	Sweet moan, sweeter smile,
	All the dovelike moans beguile.
	
	Sleep, sleep, happy child!
	All creation slept and smiled.
	Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,
	While o’er thee doth mother weep.
	
	Sweet babe, in thy face
	Holy image I can trace;
	Sweet babe, once like thee
	Thy Maker lay, and wept for me:
	
	Wept for me, for thee, for all,
	When He was an infant small.
	Thou His image ever see,
	Heavenly face that smiles on thee!
	
	Smiles on thee, on me, on all,
	Who became an infant small;
	Infant smiles are his own smiles;
	Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.


27. A SONG OF LIBERTY

	1. The Eternal Female groan’d; it was heard over all the earth:
	
	2. Albion’s coast is sick silent; the American meadows faint.
	
	3. Shadows of prophecy shiver along by the lakes and the rivers, and
	mutter across the ocean. France, rend down thy dungeon!
	
	4. Golden Spain, burst the barriers of old Rome!
	
	5. Cast thy keys, O Rome, into the deep--down falling, even to eternity
	down falling;
	
	6. And weep!
	
	7. In her trembling hands she took the new-born terror, howling.
	
	8. On those infinite mountains of light now barr’d out by the Atlantic
	sea, the new-born fire stood before the starry king.
	
	9. Flagg’d with grey-brow’d snows and thunderous visages, the jealous
	wings wav’d over the deep.
	
	10. The speary hand burn’d aloft; unbuckled was the shield; forth went
	the hand of jealousy among the flaming hair, and hurl’d the new-born
	wonder through the starry night.
	
	11. The fire, the fire is falling!
	
	12. Look up! look up! O citizen of London, enlarge thy countenance! O
	Jew, leave counting gold; return to thy oil and wine! O African, black
	African! (Go, winged thought, widen his forehead.)
	
	13. The fiery limbs, the flaming hair shot like the sinking sun into
	the Western sea.
	
	14. Wak’d from his eternal sleep, the hoary element roaring fled away.
	
	15. Down rush’d, beating his wings in vain, the jealous king, his
	grey-brow’d councillors, thunderous warriors, curl’d veterans, among
	helms and shields, and chariots, horses, elephants, banners, castles,
	slings, and rocks.
	
	16. Falling, rushing, ruining; buried in the ruins, on Urthona’s dens.
	
	17. All night beneath the ruins; then their sullen flames, faded,
	emerge round the gloomy king.
	
	18. With thunder and fire, leading his starry hosts through the waste
	wilderness, he promulgates his ten commandments, glancing his beamy
	eyelids over the deep in dark dismay.
	
	19. Where the Son of Fire in his Eastern cloud, while the Morning
	plumes her golden breast,
	
	20. Spurning the clouds written with curses, stamps the stony law
	to dust, loosing the eternal horses from the dens of night, crying:
	“Empire is no more! and now the lion and wolf shall cease.”


28. SONGS OF EXPERIENCE

	Hear the voice of the Bard,
	Who present, past, and future, sees;
	Whose ears have heard
	The Holy Word
	That walked among the ancient tree;
	
	Calling the lapsed soul,
	And weeping in the evening dew;
	That might control
	The starry pole,
	And fallen, fallen light renew!
	
	“O Earth, O Earth, return!
	Arise from out the dewy grass!
	Night is worn,
	And the morn
	Rises from the slumbrous mass.
	
	“Turn away no more;
	Why wilt thou turn away?
	The starry floor,
	The watery shore,
	Are given thee till the break of day.”


29. SPRING

	    Sound the flute!
	    Now it’s mute!
	    Bird’s delight,
	    Day and night,
	    Nightingale,
	    In the dale,
	    Lark in sky,--
	    Merrily,
	Merrily merrily, to welcome in the year.
	
	    Little boy,
	    Full of joy;
	    Little girl,
	    Sweet and small;
	    Cock does crow,
	    So do you;
	    Merry voice,
	    Infant noise;
	Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.
	
	    Little lamb,
	    Here I am;
	    Come and lick
	    My white neck;
	    Let me pull
	    Your soft wool;
	    Let me kiss
	    Your soft face;
	Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.


30. TO TIRZAH

	Whate’er is born of mortal birth
	Must be consumed with the earth,
	To rise from generation free:
	Then what have I to do with thee?
	The sexes sprang from shame and pride,
	Blown in the morn, in evening died;
	But mercy changed death into sleep;
	The sexes rose to work and weep.
	
	Thou, mother of my mortal part,
	With cruelty didst mould my heart,
	And with false self-deceiving tears
	Didst bind my nostrils, eyes, and ears,
	
	Didst close my tongue in senseless clay,
	And me to mortal life betray.
	The death of Jesus set me free:
	Then what have I to do with thee?


31. THE TYGER

	Tyger, tyger, burning bright
	In the forests of the night,
	What immortal hand or eye
	Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
	
	In what distant deeps or skies
	Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
	On what wings dare he aspire?
	What the hand dare seize the fire?
	
	And what shoulder and what art
	Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
	And, when thy heart began to beat,
	What dread hand and what dread feet?
	
	What the hammer? what the chain?
	In what furnace was thy brain?
	What the anvil? what dread grasp
	Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
	
	When the stars threw down their spears,
	And watered heaven with their tears,
	Did he smile his work to see?
	Did he who made the lamb make thee?
	
	Tyger, tyger, burning bright
	In the forests of the night,
	What immortal hand or eye
	Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
