1. AS THE DEAD PREY UPON US

	As the dead prey upon us,
	they are the dead in ourselves,
	awake, my sleeping ones, I cry out to you,
	disentangle the nets of being!
	 
	I pushed my car, it had been sitting so long unused.
	I thought the tires looked as though they only needed air.
	But suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the rear tires
	were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together
	 
	as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered
	about my mother, some of them taking care to pass
	beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
	playing on the victrola, and all of them
	desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
	 
	I turned to the young man on my right and asked, “How is it,
	there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
	poor. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
	of brake linings and other automotive accessories, cardboard
	displays, the dead roaming from one to another
	as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed
	to mere equipments
	 
	                               my mother, as alive as ever she was, asleep
	when I entered the house as I often found her in a rocker
	under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever had
	 
	I found out she returns to the house once a week, and with her
	the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in death
	as other like suited and dressed people did in life
	 
	O the dead!
	   
	      and the Indian woman and I
	      enabled the blue deer
	      to walk
	
	      and the blue deer talked,
	      in the next room,
	      a Negro talk
	
	      it was like walking a jackass,
	      and its talk
	      was the pressing gabber of gammers
	      of old women
	
	      and we helped walk it around the room
	      because it was seeking socks
	      or shoes for its hooves
	      now that it was acquiring
	
	      human possibilities
	 
	In the five hindrances men and angels
	stay caught in the net, in the immense nets
	which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
	which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels
	and the demons
	and men
	go up and down
	 
	      Walk the jackass
	      Hear the victrola
	      Let the automobile
	      be tucked into a corner of the white fence
	      when it is a white chair. Purity
	 
	is only an instant of being, the trammels
	
	recur
	 
	In the five hindrances, perfection
	is hidden
	      I shall get
	      to the place
	      10 minutes late.
	
	      It will be 20 minutes
	      of 9. And I don’t know,
	
	      without the car,
	
	      how I shall get there
	 
	O peace, my mother, I do not know
	how differently I could have done
	what I did or did not do.
	
	      That you are back each week
	      that you fall asleep
	      with your face to the right
	
	      that you are present there
	      when I come in as you were
	      when you were alive
	
	      that you are as solid, and your flesh
	      is as I knew it, that you have the company
	      I am used to your having
	
	      but o, that you all find it
	      such a cheapness!
	 
	o peace, mother, for the mammothness
	of the comings and goings
	of the ladders of life
	 
	The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
	my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle
	of  being, let none of the threads and rubber of the tires
	be left upon the earth. Let even your mother
	go. Let there be only paradise
	 
	The desperateness is, that the instant
	which is also paradise (paradise
	is happiness) dissolves
	into the next instant, and power
	flows to meet the next occurrence
	 
	         Is it any wonder
	         my mother comes back?
	         Do not that throng
	         rightly seek the room
	         where they might expect
	         happiness? They did not complain
	         of life, they obviously wanted
	         the movie, each other, merely to pass
	         among each other there,
	      where the real is, even to the display cards,
	      to be out of hell
	
	      The poverty
	      of hell
	
	O souls, in life and in death,
	make, even as you sleep, even in sleep
	know what wind
	even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
	lifts it away, clears the sodden weights of goods,
	equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
	the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
	the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room
	lifts the sodden nets
	 
	      and they disappear as ghosts do,
	      as spider webs, nothing
	      before the hand of man
	
	      The vent! You must have the vent,
	      or you shall die. Which means
	      never to die, the ghastliness
	
	      of going, and forever
	      coming back, returning
	      to the instants which were not lived
	
	      O mother, this I could not have done,
	      I could not have lived what you didn’t,
	      I am myself netted in my own being
	
	      I want to die. I want to make that instant, too,
	      perfect
	
	      O my soul, slip
	      the cog
	 
	 
	II
	 
	The death in life (death itself)
	is endless, eternity
	is the false cause
	 
	The knot is other wise, each topological corner
	presents itself, and no sword
	cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
	 
	each knot of which the net is made
	is for the hands to untake
	the knot’s making. And touch alone
	can turn the knot into its own flame
	
	      (o mother, if you had once touched me
	
	      o mother, if I had once touched you)
	 
	The car did not burn. Its underside
	was not presented to me
	a grotesque corpse. The old man
	 
	merely removed it as I looked up at it,
	and put it in a corner of the picket fence
	like was it my mother’s white dog?
	 
	or a child’s chair
	
	      The woman,
	      playing on the grass,
	      with her son (the woman next door)
	
	      was angry with me whatever it was
	      slipped across the playpen or whatever
	      she had out there on the grass
	
	      And I was quite flip in reply
	      that anyone who used plastic
	      had to expect things to skid
	
	      and break, that I couldn’t worry
	      that her son might have been hurt
	      by whatever it was I sent skidding
	
	      down on them.
	
	      It was just then I went into my house
	      and to my utter astonishment
	      found my mother sitting there
	
	      as she always had sat, as must she always
	      forever sit there her head lolling
	      into sleep? Awake, awake my mother
	
	      what wind will lift you too
	      forever from the tawdriness,
	      make you rich as all those souls
	
	      crave crave crave
	
	      to be rich?
	 
	They are right. We must have
	what we want. We cannot afford
	not to. We have only one course:
	 
	the nets which entangle us are flames
	
	      O souls, burn
	      alive, burn now
	
	      that you may forever
	      have peace, have
	
	      what you crave
	
	      O souls,
	      go into everything,
	      let not one knot pass
	      through your fingers
	
	      let not any they tell you
	      you must sleep as the net
	      comes through your authentic hands
	
	      What passes
	      is what is, what shall be, what has
	      been, what hell and heaven is
	      is earth to be rent, to shoot you
	      through the screen of flame which each knot
	      hides as all knots are a wall ready
	      to be shot open by you
	
	                                             the nets of being
	      are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
	      ought to be busy. Method, method
	
	      I too call on you to come
	      to the aid of all men, to women most
	      who know most, to woman to tell
	      men to awake. Awake, men,
	      awake
	
	I ask my mother
	to sleep. I ask her
	to stay in the chair.
	My chair
	is in the corner of the fence.
	She sits by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue deer
	need not trouble either of us.
	 
	And if she sits in happiness the souls
	who trouble her and me
	will also rest. The automobile
	 
	has been hauled away.


2. THE KINGFISHERS

	1
	 
	What does not change / is the will to change
	 
	He woke, fully clothed, in his bed. He
	remembered only one thing, the birds, how
	when he came in, he had gone around the rooms
	and got them back in their cage, the green one first,
	she with the bad leg, and then the blue,
	the one they had hoped was a male
	 
	Otherwise? Yes, Fernand, who had talked lispingly of Albers & Angkor Vat.
	He had left the party without a word. How he got up, got into his coat,
	I do not know. When I saw him, he was at the door, but it did not matter,
	he was already sliding along the wall of the night, losing himself
	in some crack of the ruins. That it should have been he who said, “The kingfishers!
	who cares
	for their feathers
	now?”
	 
	His last words had been, “The pool is slime.” Suddenly everyone,
	ceasing their talk, sat in a row around him, watched
	they did not so much hear, or pay attention, they
	wondered, looked at each other, smirked, but listened,
	he repeated and repeated, could not go beyond his thought
	“The pool    the kingfishers’ feathers were wealth    why
	did the export stop?”
	 
	It was then he left
	 
	 
	2
	 
	I thought of the E on the stone, and of what Mao said
	la lumiere”
	                    but the kingfisher
	de l’aurore”
	                    but the kingfisher flew west
	est devant nous!
	                    he got the color of his breast
	                    from the heat of the setting sun!
	 
	The features are, the feebleness of the feet (syndactylism of the 3rd & 4th digit)
	the bill, serrated, sometimes a pronounced beak, the wings
	where the color is, short and round, the tail
	inconspicuous.
	 
	But not these things were the factors. Not the birds.
	The legends are
	legends. Dead, hung up indoors, the kingfisher
	will not indicate a favoring wind,
	or avert the thunderbolt. Nor, by its nesting,
	still the waters, with the new year, for seven days.
	It is true, it does nest with the opening year, but not on the waters.
	It nests at the end of a tunnel bored by itself in a bank. There,
	six or eight white and translucent eggs are laid, on fishbones
	not on bare clay, on bones thrown up in pellets by the birds.
	 
	                                                   On these rejectamenta
	(as they accumulate they form a cup-shaped structure) the young are born.
	And, as they are fed and grow, this nest of excrement and decayed fish becomes
	                                                              a dripping, fetid mass
	 
	Mao concluded:
	                   nous devons
	                                       nous lever
	                                                         et agir!
	 
	 
	3
	 
	When the attentions change / the jungle
	leaps in
	             even the stones are split
	                                             they rive
	 
	Or,
	enter
	that other conqueror we more naturally recognize
	he so resembles ourselves
	 
	But the E
	cut so rudely on that oldest stone
	sounded otherwise,
	was differently heard
	 
	as, in another time, were treasures used:
	 
	(and, later, much later, a fine ear thought
	a scarlet coat)
	 
	                       “of green feathers    feet, beaks and eyes
	                        of gold
	 
	                       “animals likewise,
	                        resembling snails
	 
	                       “a large wheel, gold, with figures of unknown four-foots,
	                        and worked with tufts of leaves, weight
	                        3800 ounces
	 
	                       “last, two birds, of thread and featherwork, the quills
	                        gold, the feet
	                        gold, the two birds perched on two reeds
	 
	                        gold, the reeds arising from two embroidered mounds,
	                        one yellow, the other
	                        white.
	 
	                                     “And from each reed hung
	                                      seven feathered tassels.
	 
	In this instance, the priests
	(in dark cotton robes, and dirty,
	their disheveled hair matted with blood, and flowing wildly
	over their shoulders)
	rush in among the people, calling on them
	to protect their gods
	 
	And all now is war
	where so lately there was peace,
	and the sweet brotherhood, the use
	of tilled fields.
	 
	 
	4
	 
	Not one death but many,
	not accumulation but change, the feed-back proves, the feed-back is
	the law
	 
	                 Into the same river no man steps twice
	                 When fire dies air dies
	                 No one remains, nor is, one
	 
	Around an appearance, one common model, we grow up
	many. Else how is it,
	if we remain the same,
	we take pleasure now
	in what we did not take pleasure before? love
	contrary objects? admire and / or find fault? use
	other words, feel other passions, have
	nor figure, appearance, disposition, tissue
	the same?
	         To be in different states without a change
	         is not a possibility
	 
	We can be precise. The factors are
	in the animal and / or the machine the factors are
	communication and / or control, both involve
	the message. And what is the message? The message is
	a discrete or continuous sequence of measurable events distributed in time
	 
	is the birth of the air, is
	the birth of water, is
	a state between
	the origin and
	the end, between
	birth and the beginning of
	another fetid nest
	 
	is change, presents
	no more than itself
	 
	And the too strong grasping of it,
	when it is pressed together and condensed,
	loses it
	 
	This very thing you are
	 
	 
	                                                II
	 
	                  They buried their dead in a sitting posture
	                  serpent    cane    razor   ray of the sun
	 
	                  And she sprinkled water on the head of my child, crying
	                  “Cioa-coatl! Cioa-coatl!”
	                  with her face to the west
	 
	                Where the bones are found, in each personal heap
	                with what each enjoyed, there is always
	                the Mongolian louse
	 
	The light is in the east. Yes. And we must rise, act. Yet
	in the west, despite the apparent darkness (the whiteness
	which covers all), if you look, if you can bear, if you can, long enough
	 
	                       as long as it was necessary for him, my guide
	                       to look into the yellow of that longest-lasting rose
	 
	so you must, and, in that whiteness, into that face, with what candor, look
	 
	and, considering the dryness of the place
	              the long absence of an adequate race
	 
	                   (of the two who first came, each a conquistador, one healed, the other
	                   tore the eastern idols down, toppled
	                   the temple walls, which, says the excuser
	                   were black from human gore)
	 
	hear
	hear, where the dry blood talks
	         where the old appetite walks
	 
	                                                                   la piu saporita et migliore
	                                                                   che si possa truovar al mondo
	 
	where it hides, look
	in the eye how it runs
	in the flesh / chalk
	 
	                       but under these petals
	                       in the emptiness
	                       regard the light, contemplate
	                       the flower
	 
	whence it arose
	 
	               with what violence benevolence is bought
	               what cost in gesture justice brings
	               what wrongs domestic rights involve
	               what stalks
	               this silence
	 
	               what pudor pejorocracy affronts
	               how awe, night-rest and neighborhood can rot
	               what breeds where dirtiness is law
	               what crawls
	               below
	 
	 
	                                                    III
	 
	                      I am no Greek, hath not th’advantage.
	                      And of course, no Roman:
	                      he can take no risk that matters,
	                      the risk of beauty least of all.
	 
	                      But I have my kin, if for no other reason than
	                      (as he said, next of kin) I commit myself, and,
	                      given my freedom, I’d be a cad
	                      if I didn’t. Which is most true.
	 
	                      It works out this way, despite the disadvantage.
	                      I offer, in explanation, a quote:
	                      si j’ai du goût, ce n’est guères
	                      que pour la terre et les pierres.
	 
	                      Despite the discrepancy (an ocean    courage    age)
	                      this is also true: if I have any taste
	                      it is only because I have interested myself
	                      in what was slain in the sun
	 
	                              I pose you your question:
	 
	                      shall you uncover honey / where maggots are?
	 
	                              I hunt among stones


3. THE LIBRARIAN

	The landscape (the landscape!) again: Gloucester,
	the shore one of me is (duplicates), and from which
	(from offshore, I, Maximus) am removed, observe.
	 
	In this night I moved on the territory with combinations
	(new mixtures) of old and known personages: the leader,
	my father, in an old guise, here selling books and manuscripts.
	 
	My thought was, as I looked in the window of his shop,
	there should be materials here for Maximus, when, then,
	I saw he was the young musician has been there (been before me)
	 
	before. It turned out it wasn’t a shop, it was a loft (wharf-
	house) in which, as he walked me around, a year ago
	came back (I had been there before, with my wife and son,
	 
	I didn’t remember, he presented me insinuations via
	himself and his girl) both of whom I had known for years.
	But never in Gloucester. I had moved them in, to my country.
	 
	His previous appearance had been in my parents’ bedroom where I
	found him intimate with my former wife: this boy
	was now the Librarian of Gloucester, Massachusetts!
	 
	
	                         Black space,
	                         old fish-house.
	                         Motions
	                         of ghosts.
	                         I,
	                         dogging
	                         his steps.
	                         He
	                         (not my father,
	                         by name himself
	                         with his face
	                         twisted
	                         at birth)
	                         possessed of knowledge
	                         pretentious
	                         giving me
	                         what in the instant
	                         I knew better of.
	 
	                         But the somber
	                         place, the flooring
	                         crude like a wharf’s
	                         and a barn’s
	                         space
	 
	 
	I was struck by the fact I was in Gloucester, and that my daughter
	was there—that I would see her! She was over the Cut. I
	hadn’t even connected her with my being there, that she was
	 
	here. That she was there (in the Promised Land—the Cut!
	But there was this business, of poets, that all my Jews
	were in the fish-house too, that the Librarian had made a party
	 
	I was to read. They were. There were many of them, slumped
	around. It was not for me. I was outside. It was the Fort.
	The Fort was in East Gloucester—old Gorton’s Wharf, where the Library
	 
	was. It was a region of coal houses, bins. In one a gang
	was beating someone to death, in a corner of the labyrinth
	of fences. I could see their arms and shoulders whacking
	 
	down. But not the victim. I got out of there. But cops
	tailed me along the Fort beach toward the Tavern
	 
	                         The places still
	                         half-dark, mud,
	                         coal dust.
	 
	                         There is no light
	                         east
	                         of the Bridge
	 
	                         Only on the headland
	                         toward the harbor
	                         from Cressy’s
	 
	                         have I seen it (once
	                         when my daughter ran
	                         out on a spit of sand
	 
	                         isn’t even there.) Where
	                         is Bristow? when does I-A
	                         get me home? I am caught
	 
	                         in Gloucester. (What’s buried
	                         behind Lufkin’s
	                         Diner? Who is
	 
	                         Frank Moore?
