1. AND THEN NO MORE

	I SAW her once, one little while, and then no more: 
	’Twas Eden’s light on Earth a while, and then no more. 
	Amid the throng she passed along the meadow-floor: 
	Spring seemed to smile on Earth awhile, and then no more; 
	But whence she came, which way she went, what garb she wore
	I noted not; I gazed a while, and then no more! 
	
	I saw her once, one little while, and then no more: 
	’Twas Paradise on Earth a while, and then no more. 
	Ah! what avail my vigils pale, my magic lore? 
	She shone before mine eyes awhile, and then no more. 
	The shallop of my peace is wrecked on Beauty’s shore. 
	Near Hope’s fair isle it rode awhile, and then no more! 
	
	I saw her once, one little while, and then no more: 
	Earth looked like Heaven a little while, and then no more. 
	Her presence thrilled and lighted to its inner core 
	My desert breast a little while, and then no more. 
	So may, perchance, a meteor glance at midnight o’er 
	Some ruined pile a little while, and then no more! 
	
	I saw her once, one little while, and then no more: 
	The earth was Peri-land awhile, and then no more. 
	Oh, might I see but once again, as once before, 
	Through chance or wile, that shape awhile, and then no more! 
	Death soon would heal my griefs! This heart, now sad and sore, 
	Would beat anew a little while, and then no more.


2. CAHAL MÓR OF THE WINE-RED HAND

	I WALKED entranced 
	Through a land of Morn: 
	The sun, with wondrous excess of light, 
	Shone down and glanced 
	Over seas of corn 
	And lustrous gardens aleft and right. 
	Even in the clime 
	Of resplendent Spain, 
	Beams no such sun upon such a land; 
	But it was the time, 
	’T was in the reign, 
	Of Cahal Mór of the Wine-red Hand. 
	
	Anon stood nigh 
	By my side a man 
	Of princely aspect and port sublime 
	Him queried I-- 
	“Oh, my Lord and Khan, 
	What clime is this, and what golden time?” 
	When he--“The clime 
	Is a clime to praise, 
	The clime is Erin’s, the green and bland; 
	And it is the time, 
	These be the days, 
	Of Cahal Mór of the Wine-red Hand.” 
	
	Then saw I thrones 
	And circling fires, 
	And a Dome rose near me, as by a spell, 
	Whence flowed the tones 
	Of silver lyres, 
	And many voices in wreathèd swell; 
	And their thrilling chime 
	Fell on mine ears 
	As the heavenly hymn of an angel-band-- 
	“It is now the time 
	These be the years, 
	Of Cahal Mór of the Wine-red Hand.” 
	
	I sought the hall, 
	And behold!--a change 
	From light to darkness, from joy to woe! 
	Kings, nobles, all, 
	Looked aghast and strange; 
	The minstrel group sate in dumbest show! 
	Had some great crime 
	Wrought this dread amaze, 
	This terror? None seemed to understand 
	’Twas then the time, 
	We were in the days, 
	Of Cahal Mór of the Wine-red Hand. 
	
	I again walked forth; 
	But lo! the sky 
	Showed flecked with blood, and an alien sun 
	Glared from the north, 
	And there stood on high, 
	Amid his shorn beams, a skeleton! 
	It was by the stream 
	Of the castled Maine, 
	One Autumn eve, in the Teuton’s land, 
	That I dreamed this dream 
	Of the time and reign 
	Of Cahal Mór of the Wine-red Hand.


3. DARK ROSALEEN

	OH! my Dark Rosaleen,
	Do no sigh, do not weep!
	The priests are on the ocean green,
	They march along the Deep.
	There’s wine from the royal Pope
	Upon the ocean green;
	And Spanish ale shall give you hope,
	My Dark Rosaleen!
	My own Rosaleen!
	Shall glad your heart, shall give you hope,
	Shall give you health, and help, and hope,
	My Dark Rosaleen.
	
	Over hills and through dales
	Have I roamed for your sake;
	All yesterday I sailed with sails
	On river and on lake.
	The Erne, at its highest flood,
	I dashed across unseen,
	For there was lightning in my blood,
	My Dark Rosaleen!
	My own Rosaleen!
	Oh! there was lightning in my blood,
	Red lightning lightened through my blood,
	My Dark Rosaleen!
	
	All day long in unrest
	To and fro do I move,
	The very soul within my breast
	Is wasted for you love!
	The heart in my bosom faints
	To think of you, my Queen,
	My life of life, my saint of saints,
	My Dark Rosaleen!
	My own Rosaleen!
	To hear your sweet and sad complaints,
	My life, my love, my saint of saints,
	My Dark Rosaleen!
	
	Woe and pain, pain and woe,
	Are my lot night and noon,
	To see your bright face clouded so,
	Like to the mournful moon.
	But yet will I rear your throne
	Again in golden sheen;
	‘Tis you shall reign, shall reign alone,
	My Dark Rosaleen!
	My own Rosaleen!
	‘Tis you shall have the golden throne,
	‘Tis you shall reign, and reign alone,
	My Dark Rosaleen!
	
	Over dews, over sands
	Will I fly for your weal;
	Your holy delicate white hands
	Shall girdle me with steel.
	At home in your emerald bowers,
	From morning’s dawn till e’en,
	You’ll pray for me, my flower of flowers,
	My Dark Rosaleen!
	My fond Rosaleen!
	You’ll think of me through daylight’s hours,
	My virgin flower, my flower of flowers,
	My Dark Rosaleen!
	
	I could scale the blue air,
	I could plough the high hills,
	Oh, I could kneel all night in prayer,
	To heal your many ills!
	And one beamy smile for you
	Would float like light between
	My toils and me, my own, my true,
	My Dark Rosaleen!
	My fond Rosaleen!
	Would give me life and soul anew,
	A second life, a soul anew,
	My Dark Rosaleen!
	
	O! the Erne shall run red
	With redundance of blood,
	The earth shall rock beneath our tread,
	And flames wrap hill and wood,
	And gun-peal, a slogan cry,
	Wake many a glen serene,
	Ere you shall fade, ere you shall die,
	My Dark Rosaleen!
	My own Rosaleen!
	The Judgement Hour must first be nigh,
	Ere you can fade, ere you can die,
	My Dark Rosaleen!


4. KATHALEEN NY-HOULAHAN

	LONG they pine in weary woe--the nobles of our land--
	Long they wander to and fro, proscribed, alas! and banned;
	Feastless, houseless, altarless, they bear the exie’s brand,
	But their hope is in the coming-to of Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan.
	
	Think not her a ghastly hag, too hideous to be seen;
	Call her not unseemly names, our matchless Kathaleen;
	Young she is, and fair she is, and would be crowned a qeeen,
	Were the king’s son at home here with Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan.
	
	Sweet and mild would look her face--Oh! none so sweet and mild--
	Could she crush the foes by whom her beauty is reviled;
	Woolen plaids would grace herself and robes of silk her child,
	If the king’s son were living here with Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan.
	
	Sore disgrace it is to see the Arbitress of thrones
	Vassal to a Saxoneen of cold and hapless bones!
	Bitter anguish wrings our souls--with heavy sighs and groans
	We wait the Young Deliverer of Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan.
	
	Let us pray to Him who holds life’s issues in His hands,
	Him who formed the mighty globe, with all his thousand lands;
	Girding them with sea and mountains, rivers deep, and strands,
	To cast a look of pity upon Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan.
	
	He, who over sands and waves led Israel along--
	He who fed, with heavenly bread, that chosen tribe and throng;
	He who stood by Moses when his foes were fierce and strong,
	May He show forth His might in saving Kathaleen Ny-Houlahan.


5. THE NAMELESS ONE

	ROLL forth, my song, like the rushing river, 
	  That sweeps along to the mighty sea; 
	God will inspire me while I deliver 
	  My soul of thee! 
	
	Tell thou the world, when my bones lie whitening 
	  Amid the last homes of youth and eld, 
	That once there was one whose veins ran lightning 
	  No eye beheld. 
	
	Tell how his boyhood was one drear night-hour, 
	  How shone for him, through his griefs and gloom, 
	No star of all heaven sends to light our 
	  Path to the tomb. 
	
	Roll on, my song, and to after ages 
	  Tell how, disdaining all earth can give, 
	He would have taught men, from wisdom’s pages, 
	  The way to live. 
	
	And tell how trampled, derided, hated, 
	  And worn by weakness, disease, and wrong, 
	He fled for shelter to God, who mated 
	  His soul with song. 
	
	--With song which alway, sublime or vapid, 
	  Flow’d like a rill in the morning beam, 
	Perchance not deep, but intense and rapid-- 
	  A mountain stream. 
	
	Tell how this Nameless, condemn’d for years long 
	  To herd with demons from hell beneath, 
	Saw things that made him, with groans and tears, long 
	  For even death. 
	
	Go on to tell how, with genius wasted, 
	  Betray’d in friendship, befool’d in love, 
	With spirit shipwreck’d, and young hopes blasted, 
	  He still, still strove; 
	
	Till, spent with toil, dreeing death for others 
	  (And some whose hands should have wrought for him, 
	If children live not for sires and mothers), 
	  His mind grew dim; 
	
	And he fell far through that pit abysmal, 
	  The gulf and grave of Maginn and Burns, 
	And pawn’d his soul for the devil’s dismal 
	  Stock of returns. 
	
	But yet redeem’d it in days of darkness, 
	  And shapes and signs of the final wrath, 
	When death, in hideous and ghastly starkness, 
	  Stood on his path. 
	
	And tell how now, amid wreck and sorrow, 
	  And want, and sickness, and houseless nights, 
	He bides in calmness the silent morrow, 
	  That no ray lights. 
	
	And lives he still, then? Yes! Old and hoary 
	  At thirty-nine, from despair and woe, 
	He lives, enduring what future story 
	  Will never know. 
	
	Him grant a grave to, ye pitying noble, 
	  Deep in your bosoms: there let him dwell! 
	He, too, had tears for all souls in trouble, 
	  Here and in hell.


6. SHAPES AND SIGNS

	I SEE black dragons mount the sky,
	I see earth yawn beneath my feet--
	I feel within the asp, the worm
	That will not sleep and cannot die,
	Fair though may show the winding-sheet!
	I hear all night as through a storm
	Hoarse voices calling, calling
	My name upon the wind--
	All omens monstrous and appalling
	Affright my guilty mind.
	
	I exult alone in one wild hour--
	That hour in which the red cup drowns
	The memories it anon renews
	In ghastlier guise, in fiercer power--
	Then Fancy brings me golden crowns,
	And visions of all brilliant hues
	Lap my lost soul in gladness,
	Until I awake again,
	And the dark lava-fires of madness
	Once more sweep through my brain.


7. SIBERIA

	IN Siberia’s wastes
	The ice-wind’s breath
	Woundeth like the toothed steel;
	Lost Siberia doth reveal
	Only blight and death.
	
	Blight and death alone.
	No Summer shines.
	Night is interblent with Day.
	In Siberia’s wastes alway
	The blood blackens, the heart pines.
	
	In Siberia’s wastes
	No tears are shed,
	For they freeze within the brain.
	Nought is felt but dullest pain,
	Pain acute, yet dead;
	
	Pain as in a dream,
	When years go by
	Funeral-paced, yet fugitive,
	When man lives, and doth not live.
	Doth not live--nor die.
	
	In Siberia’s wastes
	Are sands and rocks
	Nothing blooms of green or soft,
	But the snow-peaks rise aloft
	And the gaunt ice-blocks.
	
	And the exile there
	Is one with those;
	They are part, and lie is part,
	For the sands are in his heart,
	And the killing snows.
	
	Therefore, in those wastes
	None curse the Czar.
	Each man’s tongue is cloven by
	The North Blast, that heweth nigh
	With sharp scymitar.
	
	And such doom each sees,
	Till, hunger-gnawn,
	And cold-slain, he at length sinks there,
	Yet scarce more a corpse than ere
	His last breath was drawn.
