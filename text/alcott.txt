*** Louisa May Alcott (1832 - 1888)


1. DON’T DRIVE ME AWAY

	Don’t drive me away, 
	But hear what I say: 
	Bad men want the gold; 
	They will steal it to-night, 
	And you must take flight; 
	So be quiet and busy and bold.
	
	Slip away with me, 
	And you will see 
	What a wise little thing am I; 
	For the road I show 
	No man can know, 
	Since it’s up in the pathless sky.


2. MY KINGDOM

	A little kingdom I possess 
	where thoughts and feelings dwell, 
	And very hard I find the task 
	of governing it well; 
	For passion tempts and troubles me, 
	A wayward will misleads, 
	And selfishness its shadow casts 
	On all my words and deeds. 
	
	How can I learn to rule myself, 
	to be the child I should, 
	Honest and brave, nor ever tire 
	Of trying to be good? 
	How can I keep a sunny soul 
	To shine along life’s way? 
	How can I tune my little heart 
	To sweetly sing all day? 
	
	Dear Father, help me with the love 
	that casteth out my fear; 
	Teach me to lean on thee, and feel 
	That thou art very near, 
	That no temptation is unseen 
	No childish grief too small, 
	Since thou, with patience infinite, 
	Doth soothe and comfort all. 
	
	I do not ask for any crown 
	But that which all may win 
	Nor seek to conquer any world 
	Except the one within. 
	Be thou my guide until I find, 
	Led by a tender hand, 
	Thy happy kingdom in myself 
	And dare to take command.
