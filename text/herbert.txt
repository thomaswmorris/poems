*** George Herbert (1593 - 1633)


1. THE AFFLICTION

	When first thou didst entice to thee my heart,
	I thought the service brave;
	So many joys I writ down for my part,
	Besides what I might have
	Out of my stock of natural delights,
	Augmented with thy gracious benefits.
	
	I looked on thy furniture so fine,
	And made it fine to me;
	Thy glorious household-stuff did me entwine,
	And ‘tice me unto thee.
	Such stars I counted mine: both heav’n and earth;
	Paid me my wages in a world of mirth.
	
	What pleasures could I want, whose King I serv’d,
	Where joys my fellows were?
	Thus argu’d into hopes, my thoughts reserv’d
	No place for grief or fear.
	Therefore my sudden soul caught at the place,
	And made her youth and fierceness seek thy face.
	
	At first thou gav’st me milk and sweetnesses;
	I had my wish and way;
	My days were straw’d with flow’rs and happiness;
	There was no month but May.
	But with my years sorrow did twist and grow,
	And made a party unawares for woe.
	
	My flesh began unto my soul in pain,
	“Sicknesses cleave my bones;
	Consuming agues dwell in ev’ry vein,
	And tune my breath to groans.”
	Sorrow was all my soul; I scarce believ’d,
	Till grief did tell me roundly, that I liv’d.
	
	When I got health, thou took’st away my life,
	And more, for my friends die;
	My mirth and edge was lost, a blunted knife
	Was of more use than I.
	Thus thin and lean without a fence or friend,
	I was blown through with ev’ry storm and wind.
	
	Whereas my birth and spirit rather took
	The way that takes the town;
	Thou didst betray me to a ling’ring book,
	And wrap me in a gown.
	I was entangled in the world of strife,
	Before I had the power to change my life.
	
	Yet, for I threaten’d oft the siege to raise,
	Not simp’ring all mine age,
	Thou often didst with academic praise
	Melt and dissolve my rage.
	I took thy sweet’ned pill, till I came where
	I could not go away, nor persevere.
	
	Yet lest perchance I should too happy be
	In my unhappiness,
	Turning my purge to food, thou throwest me
	Into more sicknesses.
	Thus doth thy power cross-bias me, not making
	Thine own gift good, yet me from my ways taking.
	
	Now I am here, what thou wilt do with me
	None of my books will show;
	I read, and sigh, and wish I were a tree,
	For sure then I should grow
	To fruit or shade: at least some bird would trust
	Her household to me, and I should be just.
	
	Yet, though thou troublest me, I must be meek;
	In weakness must be stout;
	Well, I will change the service, and go seek
	Some other master out.
	Ah my dear God! though I am clean forgot,
	Let me not love thee, if I love thee not.


2. DEATH

	Death, thou wast once an uncouth hideous thing,
	                          Nothing but bones,
	     The sad effect of sadder groans:
	Thy mouth was open, but thou couldst not sing.
	
	For we considered thee as at some six
	                          Or ten years hence,
	     After the loss of life and sense,
	Flesh being turned to dust, and bones to sticks.
	
	We looked on this side of thee, shooting short;
	                        Where we did find
	     The shells of fledge souls left behind,
	Dry dust, which sheds no tears, but may extort.
	
	But since our Savior’s death did put some blood
	                          Into thy face,
	     Thou art grown fair and full of grace,
	Much in request, much sought for as a good.
	
	For we do now behold thee gay and glad,
	                          As at Doomsday;
	     When souls shall wear their new array,
	And all thy bones with beauty shall be clad.
	
	Therefore we can go die as sleep, and trust
	                          Half that we have
	     Unto an honest faithful grave;
	Making our pillows either down, or dust.


3. DISCIPLINE

	Throw away thy rod,
	Throw away thy wrath:
	                 O my God,
	Take the gentle path.
	
	For my heart’s desire
	Unto thine is bent:
	                 I aspire
	To a full consent.
	
	Not a word or look
	I affect to own,
	                 But by book,
	And thy book alone.
	
	Though I fail, I weep:
	Though I halt in pace,
	                 Yet I creep
	To the throne of grace.
	
	Then let wrath remove;
	Love will do the deed:
	                 For with love
	Stony hearts will bleed.
	
	Love is swift of foot;
	Love’s a man of war,
	                 And can shoot,
	And can hit from far.
	
	Who can ’scape his bow?
	That which wrought on thee,
	                 Brought thee low,
	Needs must work on me.
	
	Throw away thy rod;
	Though man frailties hath,
	        Thou art God:
	Throw away thy wrath.


4. THE FLOWER

	How fresh, oh Lord, how sweet and clean
	Are thy returns! even as the flowers in spring;
	        To which, besides their own demean,
	The late-past frosts tributes of pleasure bring.
	                     Grief melts away
	                     Like snow in May,
	        As if there were no such cold thing.
	
	        Who would have thought my shriveled heart
	Could have recovered greenness? It was gone
	        Quite underground; as flowers depart
	To see their mother-root, when they have blown,
	                     Where they together
	                     All the hard weather,
	        Dead to the world, keep house unknown.
	
	        These are thy wonders, Lord of power,
	Killing and quickening, bringing down to hell
	        And up to heaven in an hour;
	Making a chiming of a passing-bell.
	                     We say amiss
	                     This or that is:
	        Thy word is all, if we could spell.
	
	        Oh that I once past changing were,
	Fast in thy Paradise, where no flower can wither!
	        Many a spring I shoot up fair,
	Offering at heaven, growing and groaning thither;
	                     Nor doth my flower
	                     Want a spring shower,
	        My sins and I joining together.
	
	        But while I grow in a straight line,
	Still upwards bent, as if heaven were mine own,
	        Thy anger comes, and I decline:
	What frost to that? what pole is not the zone
	                     Where all things burn,
	                     When thou dost turn,
	        And the least frown of thine is shown?
	
	        And now in age I bud again,
	After so many deaths I live and write;
	        I once more smell the dew and rain,
	And relish versing. Oh, my only light,
	                     It cannot be
	                     That I am he
	        On whom thy tempests fell all night.
	
	        These are thy wonders, Lord of love,
	To make us see we are but flowers that glide;
	        Which when we once can find and prove,
	Thou hast a garden for us where to bide;
	                     Who would be more,
	                     Swelling through store,
	        Forfeit their Paradise by their pride.


5. LIFE

	I made a posy, while the day ran by:
	“Here will I smell my remnant out, and tie
	                          My life within this band.”
	But Time did beckon to the flowers, and they
	By noon most cunningly did steal away,
	                          And withered in my hand.
	
	My hand was next to them, and then my heart;
	I took, without more thinking, in good part
	                          Time’s gentle admonition;
	Who did so sweetly death’s sad taste convey,
	Making my mind to smell my fatal day,
	                          Yet, sug’ring the suspicion.
	
	Farewell dear flowers, sweetly your time ye spent,
	Fit, while ye lived, for smell or ornament,
	                          And after death for cures.
	I follow straight without complaints or grief,
	Since, if my scent be good, I care not if
	                          It be as short as yours.


6. THE QUIP

	The merry World did on a day
	With his train-bands and mates agree
	To meet together where I lay,
	And all in sport to jeer at me.
	
	First Beauty crept into a rose,
	Which when I pluck’d not, “Sir,“ said she,
	“Tell me, I pray, whose hands are those?”
	But Thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.
	
	Then Money came, and chinking still,
	“What tune is this, poor man?“ said he;
	“I heard in music you had skill:”
	But Thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.
	
	Then came brave Glory puffing by
	In silks that whistled, who but he?
	He scarce allow’d me half an eye:
	But Thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.
	
	Then came quick Wit and Conversation,
	And he would needs a comfort be,
	And, to be short, make an oration:
	But Thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.
	
	Yet when the hour of Thy design
	To answer these fine things shall come,
	Speak not at large, say, I am Thine;
	And then they have their answer home.


7. VIRTUE

	Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,
	The bridal of the earth and sky:
	The dew shall weep thy fall to-night;
	   For thou must die.
	
	Sweet rose, whose hue angry and brave
	Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye:
	Thy root is ever in its grave,
	   And thou must die.
	
	Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,
	A box where sweets compacted lie;
	My music shows ye have your closes,
	   And all must die.
	
	Only a sweet and virtuous soul,
	Like season’d timber, never gives;
	But though the whole world turn to coal,
	   Then chiefly lives.


8. THE WINDOWS

	Lord, how can man preach thy eternal word?
	   He is a brittle crazy glass;
	Yet in thy temple thou dost him afford
	   This glorious and transcendent place,
	   To be a window, through thy grace.
	
	But when thou dost anneal in glass thy story,
	   Making thy life to shine within
	The holy preachers, then the light and glory
	   More reverend grows, and more doth win;
	   Which else shows waterish, bleak, and thin.
	
	Doctrine and life, colors and light, in one
	   When they combine and mingle, bring
	A strong regard and awe; but speech alone
	   Doth vanish like a flaring thing,
	   And in the ear, not conscience, ring.
