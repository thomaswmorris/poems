*** Federico García Lorca (1898 - 1936)


1. THE CITY THAT DOES NOT SLEEP

	In the sky there is nobody asleep. Nobody, nobody.
	Nobody is asleep.
	The creatures of the moon sniff and prowl about their cabins.
	The living iguanas will come and bite the men who do not dream,
	and the man who rushes out with his spirit broken will meet on the
	street corner
	the unbelievable alligator quiet beneath the tender protest of the
	stars.
	
	Nobody is asleep on earth. Nobody, nobody.
	Nobody is asleep.
	In a graveyard far off there is a corpse
	who has moaned for three years
	because of a dry countryside on his knee;
	and that boy they buried this morning cried so much
	it was necessary to call out the dogs to keep him quiet.
	
	Life is not a dream. Careful! Careful! Careful!
	We fall down the stairs in order to eat the moist earth
	or we climb to the knife edge of the snow with the voices of the dead
	dahlias.
	But forgetfulness does not exist, dreams do not exist;
	flesh exists. Kisses tie our mouths
	in a thicket of new veins,
	and whoever his pain pains will feel that pain forever
	and whoever is afraid of death will carry it on his shoulders.
	
	One day
	the horses will live in the saloons
	and the enraged ants
	will throw themselves on the yellow skies that take refuge in the
	eyes of cows.
	
	Another day
	we will watch the preserved butterflies rise from the dead
	and still walking through a country of gray sponges and silent boats
	we will watch our ring flash and roses spring from our tongue.
	Careful! Be careful! Be careful!
	The men who still have marks of the claw and the thunderstorm,
	and that boy who cries because he has never heard of the invention
	of the bridge,
	or that dead man who possesses now only his head and a shoe,
	we must carry them to the wall where the iguanas and the snakes
	are waiting,
	where the bear’s teeth are waiting,
	where the mummified hand of the boy is waiting,
	and the hair of the camel stands on end with a violent blue shudder.
	
	Nobody is sleeping in the sky. Nobody, nobody.
	Nobody is sleeping.
	If someone does close his eyes,
	a whip, boys, a whip!
	Let there be a landscape of open eyes
	and bitter wounds on fire.
	No one is sleeping in this world. No one, no one.
	I have said it before.
	
	No one is sleeping.
	But if someone grows too much moss on his temples during the
	night,
	open the stage trapdoors so he can see in the moonlight
	the lying goblets, and the poison, and the skull of the theaters.


2. THE FAITHLESS WIFE

	So I took her to the river
	believing she was a maiden,
	but she already had a husband.
	It was on St. James night
	and almost as if I was obliged to.
	The lanterns went out
	and the crickets lighted up.
	In the farthest street corners
	I touched her sleeping breasts
	and they opened to me suddenly
	like spikes of hyacinth.
	The starch of her petticoat
	sounded in my ears
	like a piece of silk
	rent by ten knives.
	Without silver light on their foliage
	the trees had grown larger
	and a horizon of dogs
	barked very far from the river.
	
	Past the blackberries,
	the reeds and the hawthorne
	underneath her cluster of hair
	I made a hollow in the earth
	I took off my tie,
	she too off her dress.
	I, my belt with the revolver,
	She, her four bodices.
	Nor nard nor mother-o’-pearl
	have skin so fine,
	nor does glass with silver
	shine with such brilliance.
	Her thighs slipped away from me
	like startled fish,
	half full of fire,
	half full of cold.
	That night I ran
	on the best of roads
	mounted on a nacre mare
	without bridle stirrups.
	
	As a man, I won’t repeat
	the things she said to me.
	The light of understanding
	has made me more discreet.
	Smeared with sand and kisses
	I took her away from the river.
	The swords of the lilies
	battled with the air.
	
	I behaved like what I am,
	like a proper gypsy.
	I gave her a large sewing basket,
	of straw-colored satin,
	but I did not fall in love
	for although she had a husband
	she told me she was a maiden
	when I took her to the river.
