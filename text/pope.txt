*** Alexander Pope (1688 - 1744)


1. ODE ON SOLITUDE

	Happy the man, whose wish and care 
	  A few paternal acres bound, 
	Content to breathe his native air, 
	                           In his own ground. 
	
	Whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread, 
	  Whose flocks supply him with attire, 
	Whose trees in summer yield him shade, 
	                           In winter fire. 
	
	Blest, who can unconcernedly find 
	  Hours, days, and years slide soft away, 
	In health of body, peace of mind, 
	                           Quiet by day, 
	
	Sound sleep by night; study and ease, 
	  Together mixed; sweet recreation; 
	And innocence, which most does please, 
	                           With meditation. 
	
	Thus let me live, unseen, unknown; 
	  Thus unlamented let me die; 
	Steal from the world, and not a stone 
	                           Tell where I lie.


2. THE RIDDLE OF THE WORLD

	Know then thyself, presume not God to scan
	The proper study of Mankind is Man.
	Placed on this isthmus of a middle state,
	A Being darkly wise, and rudely great:
	With too much knowledge for the Sceptic side,
	With too much weakness for the Stoic’s pride,
	He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest;
	In doubt to deem himself a God, or Beast;
	In doubt his mind and body to prefer;
	Born but to die, and reas’ning but to err;
	Whether he thinks to little, or too much;
	Chaos of Thought and Passion, all confus’d;
	Still by himself, abus’d or disabus’d;
	Created half to rise and half to fall;
	Great Lord of all things, yet a prey to all,
	Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurl’d;
	The glory, jest and riddle of the world.


3. SUMMER

	See what delights in sylvan scenes appear!
	Descending Gods have found Elysium here.
	In woods bright Venus with Adonis stray’d,
	And chaste Diana haunts the forest shade.
	Come lovely nymph, and bless the silent hours,
	When swains from shearing seek their nightly bow’rs;
	When weary reapers quit the sultry field,
	And crown’d with corn, their thanks to Ceres yield.
	This harmless grove no lurking viper hides,
	But in my breast the serpent Love abides.
	Here bees from blossoms sip the rosy dew,
	But your Alexis knows no sweets but you.
	Oh deign to visit our forsaken seats,
	The mossy fountains, and the green retreats!
	Where-e’er you walk, cool gales shall fan the glade,
	Trees, where you sit, shall crowd into a shade,
	Where-e’er you tread, the blushing flow’rs shall rise,
	And all things flourish where you turn your eyes.
	Oh! How I long with you to pass my days,
	Invoke the muses, and resound your praise;
	Your praise the birds shall chant in ev’ry grove,
	And winds shall waft it to the pow’rs above.
	But wou’d you sing, and rival Orpheus’ strain,
	The wond’ring forests soon shou’d dance again,
	The moving mountains hear the pow’rful call,
	And headlong streams hang list’ning in their fall!
	But see, the shepherds shun the noon-day heat,
	The lowing herds to murm’ring brooks retreat,
	To closer shades the panting flocks remove,
	Ye Gods! And is there no relief for Love?
	But soon the sun with milder rays descends
	To the cool ocean, where his journey ends;
	On me Love’s fiercer flames for every prey,
	By night he scorches, as he burns by day.
