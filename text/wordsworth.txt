*** William Wordsworth (1770 - 1850)


1. LINES WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING

	I heard a thousand blended notes, 
	While in a grove I sate reclined, 
	In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts 
	Bring sad thoughts to the mind. 
	
	To her fair works did Nature link 
	The human soul that through me ran; 
	And much it grieved my heart to think 
	What man has made of man. 
	
	Through primrose tufts, in that green bower, 
	The periwinkle trailed its wreaths; 
	And ’tis my faith that every flower 
	Enjoys the air it breathes. 
	
	The birds around me hopped and played, 
	Their thoughts I cannot measure:-- 
	But the least motion which they made 
	It seemed a thrill of pleasure. 
	
	The budding twigs spread out their fan, 
	To catch the breezy air; 
	And I must think, do all I can, 
	That there was pleasure there. 
	
	If this belief from heaven be sent, 
	If such be Nature’s holy plan, 
	Have I not reason to lament 
	What man has made of man?


2. ODE TO DUTY

	_Jam non consilio bonus, sed more eo perductus, ut non tantum recte facere possim, sed nisi recte facere non possim“_
	
	“I am no longer good through deliberate intent, but by long habit have reached a point where I am not only able to do right, but am unable to do anything but what is right.“ 
	--_Seneca, Letters 120.10_
	
	Stern Daughter of the Voice of God! 
	O Duty! if that name thou love 
	Who art a light to guide, a rod 
	To check the erring, and reprove; 
	Thou, who art victory and law 
	When empty terrors overawe; 
	From vain temptations dost set free; 
	And calm’st the weary strife of frail humanity! 
	
	There are who ask not if thine eye 
	Be on them; who, in love and truth, 
	Where no misgiving is, rely 
	Upon the genial sense of youth: 
	Glad Hearts! without reproach or blot; 
	Who do thy work, and know it not: 
	Oh! if through confidence misplaced 
	They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them cast. 
	
	Serene will be our days and bright, 
	And happy will our nature be, 
	When love is an unerring light, 
	And joy its own security. 
	And they a blissful course may hold 
	Even now, who, not unwisely bold, 
	Live in the spirit of this creed; 
	Yet seek thy firm support, according to their need. 
	
	I, loving freedom, and untried; 
	No sport of every random gust, 
	Yet being to myself a guide, 
	Too blindly have reposed my trust: 
	And oft, when in my heart was heard 
	Thy timely mandate, I deferred 
	The task, in smoother walks to stray; 
	But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I may. 
	
	Through no disturbance of my soul, 
	Or strong compunction in me wrought, 
	I supplicate for thy control; 
	But in the quietness of thought: 
	Me this unchartered freedom tires; 
	I feel the weight of chance-desires: 
	My hopes no more must change their name, 
	I long for a repose that ever is the same. 
	
	Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear 
	The Godhead’s most benignant grace; 
	Nor know we anything so fair 
	As is the smile upon thy face: 
	Flowers laugh before thee on their beds 
	And fragrance in thy footing treads; 
	Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong; 
	And the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are fresh and strong. 
	
	To humbler functions, awful Power! 
	I call thee: I myself commend 
	Unto thy guidance from this hour; 
	Oh, let my weakness have an end! 
	Give unto me, made lowly wise, 
	The spirit of self-sacrifice; 
	The confidence of reason give; 
	And in the light of truth thy Bondman let me live!


3. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE

	There was a roaring in the wind all night; 
	The rain came heavily and fell in floods; 
	But now the sun is rising calm and bright; 
	The birds are singing in the distant woods; 
	Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods; 
	The Jay makes answer as the Magpie chatters; 
	And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters. 
	
	All things that love the sun are out of doors; 
	The sky rejoices in the morning’s birth; 
	The grass is bright with rain-drops;--on the moors 
	The hare is running races in her mirth; 
	And with her feet she from the plashy earth 
	Raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun, 
	Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run. 
	
	I was a Traveller then upon the moor; 
	I saw the hare that raced about with joy; 
	I heard the woods and distant waters roar; 
	Or heard them not, as happy as a boy: 
	The pleasant season did my heart employ: 
	My old remembrances went from me wholly; 
	And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy. 
	
	But, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might 
	Of joys in minds that can no further go, 
	As high as we have mounted in delight 
	In our dejection do we sink as low; 
	To me that morning did it happen so; 
	And fears and fancies thick upon me came; 
	Dim sadness--and blind thoughts, I knew not, nor could name. 
	
	I heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky; 
	And I bethought me of the playful hare: 
	Even such a happy Child of earth am I; 
	Even as these blissful creatures do I fare; 
	Far from the world I walk, and from all care; 
	But there may come another day to me-- 
	Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty. 
	
	My whole life I have lived in pleasant thought, 
	As if life’s business were a summer mood; 
	As if all needful things would come unsought 
	To genial faith, still rich in genial good; 
	But how can He expect that others should 
	Build for him, sow for him, and at his call 
	Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all? 
	
	I thought of Chatterton, the marvellous Boy, 
	The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride; 
	Of Him who walked in glory and in joy 
	Following his plough, along the mountain-side: 
	By our own spirits are we deified: 
	We Poets in our youth begin in gladness; 
	But thereof come in the end despondency and madness. 
	
	Now, whether it were by peculiar grace, 
	A leading from above, a something given, 
	Yet it befell that, in this lonely place, 
	When I with these untoward thoughts had striven, 
	Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven 
	I saw a Man before me unawares: 
	The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs. 
	
	As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie 
	Couched on the bald top of an eminence; 
	Wonder to all who do the same espy, 
	By what means it could thither come, and whence; 
	So that it seems a thing endued with sense: 
	Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf 
	Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself; 
	
	Such seemed this Man, not all alive nor dead, 
	Nor all asleep--in his extreme old age: 
	His body was bent double, feet and head 
	Coming together in life’s pilgrimage; 
	As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage 
	Of sickness felt by him in times long past, 
	A more than human weight upon his frame had cast. 
	
	Himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face, 
	Upon a long grey staff of shaven wood: 
	And, still as I drew near with gentle pace, 
	Upon the margin of that moorish flood 
	Motionless as a cloud the old Man stood, 
	That heareth not the loud winds when they call, 
	And moveth all together, if it move at all. 
	
	At length, himself unsettling, he the pond 
	Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look 
	Upon the muddy water, which he conned, 
	As if he had been reading in a book: 
	And now a stranger’s privilege I took; 
	And, drawing to his side, to him did say, 
	“This morning gives us promise of a glorious day.“ 
	
	A gentle answer did the old Man make, 
	In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew: 
	And him with further words I thus bespake, 
	“What occupation do you there pursue? 
	This is a lonesome place for one like you.“ 
	Ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise 
	Broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes. 
	
	His words came feebly, from a feeble chest, 
	But each in solemn order followed each, 
	With something of a lofty utterance drest-- 
	Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach 
	Of ordinary men; a stately speech; 
	Such as grave Livers do in Scotland use, 
	Religious men, who give to God and man their dues. 
	
	He told, that to these waters he had come 
	To gather leeches, being old and poor: 
	Employment hazardous and wearisome! 
	And he had many hardships to endure: 
	From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor; 
	Housing, with God’s good help, by choice or chance; 
	And in this way he gained an honest maintenance. 
	
	The old Man still stood talking by my side; 
	But now his voice to me was like a stream 
	Scarce heard; nor word from word could I divide; 
	And the whole body of the Man did seem 
	Like one whom I had met with in a dream; 
	Or like a man from some far region sent, 
	To give me human strength, by apt admonishment. 
	
	My former thoughts returned: the fear that kills; 
	And hope that is unwilling to be fed; 
	Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills; 
	And mighty Poets in their misery dead. 
	--Perplexed, and longing to be comforted, 
	My question eagerly did I renew, 
	“How is it that you live, and what is it you do?“ 
	
	He with a smile did then his words repeat; 
	And said that, gathering leeches, far and wide 
	He travelled; stirring thus about his feet 
	The waters of the pools where they abide. 
	“Once I could meet with them on every side; 
	But they have dwindled long by slow decay; 
	Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may.“ 
	
	While he was talking thus, the lonely place, 
	The old Man’s shape, and speech--all troubled me: 
	In my mind’s eye I seemed to see him pace 
	About the weary moors continually, 
	Wandering about alone and silently. 
	While I these thoughts within myself pursued, 
	He, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed. 
	
	And soon with this he other matter blended, 
	Cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind, 
	But stately in the main; and, when he ended, 
	I could have laughed myself to scorn to find 
	In that decrepit Man so firm a mind. 
	“God,“ said I, “be my help and stay secure; 
	I’ll think of the Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!”


4. SEPTEMBER

	Departing summer hath assumed 
	An aspect tenderly illumed, 
	The gentlest look of spring; 
	That calls from yonder leafy shade 
	Unfaded, yet prepared to fade, 
	A timely carolling. 
	
	No faint and hesitating trill, 
	Such tribute as to winter chill 
	The lonely redbreast pays! 
	Clear, loud, and lively is the din, 
	From social warblers gathering in 
	Their harvest of sweet lays. 
	
	Nor doth the example fail to cheer 
	Me, conscious that my leaf is sere, 
	And yellow on the bough:-- 
	Fall, rosy garlands, from my head! 
	Ye myrtle wreaths, your fragrance shed 
	Around a younger brow! 
	
	Yet will I temperately rejoice; 
	Wide is the range, and free the choice 
	Of undiscordant themes; 
	Which, haply, kindred souls may prize 
	Not less than vernal ecstasies, 
	And passion’s feverish dreams. 
	
	For deathless powers to verse belong, 
	And they like Demi-gods are strong 
	On whom the Muses smile; 
	But some their function have disclaimed, 
	Best pleased with what is aptliest framed 
	To enervate and defile. 
	
	Not such the initiatory strains 
	Committed to the silent plains 
	In Britain’s earliest dawn: 
	Trembled the groves, the stars grew pale, 
	While all-too-daringly the veil 
	Of nature was withdrawn! 
	
	Nor such the spirit-stirring note 
	When the live chords Alcæus smote, 
	Inflamed by sense of wrong; 
	Woe! woe to Tyrants! from the lyre 
	Broke threateningly, in sparkles dire 
	Of fierce vindictive song. 
	
	And not unhallowed was the page 
	By wingèd Love inscribed, to assuage 
	The pangs of vain pursuit; 
	Love listening while the Lesbian Maid 
	With finest touch of passion swayed 
	Her own Æolian lute. 
	
	O ye, who patiently explore 
	The wreck of Herculanean lore, 
	What rapture! could ye seize 
	Some Theban fragment, or unroll 
	One precious, tender-hearted scroll 
	Of pure Simonides. 
	
	That were, indeed, a genuine birth 
	Of poesy; a bursting forth 
	Of genius from the dust: 
	What Horace gloried to behold, 
	What Maro loved, shall we enfold? 
	Can haughty Time be just! 


5. THE TABLES TURNED

	Up! up! my Friend, and quit your books; 
	Or surely you’ll grow double: 
	Up! up! my Friend, and clear your looks; 
	Why all this toil and trouble? 
	
	The sun above the mountain’s head, 
	A freshening lustre mellow 
	Through all the long green fields has spread, 
	His first sweet evening yellow. 
	
	Books! ‘tis a dull and endless strife: 
	Come, hear the woodland linnet, 
	How sweet his music! on my life, 
	There’s more of wisdom in it. 
	
	And hark! how blithe the throstle sings! 
	He, too, is no mean preacher: 
	Come forth into the light of things, 
	Let Nature be your teacher. 
	
	She has a world of ready wealth, 
	Our minds and hearts to bless-- 
	Spontaneous wisdom breathed by health, 
	Truth breathed by cheerfulness. 
	
	One impulse from a vernal wood 
	May teach you more of man, 
	Of moral evil and of good, 
	Than all the sages can. 
	
	Sweet is the lore which Nature brings; 
	Our meddling intellect 
	Mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things:-- 
	We murder to dissect. 
	
	Enough of Science and of Art; 
	Close up those barren leaves; 
	Come forth, and bring with you a heart 
	That watches and receives. 


6. THERE WAS A BOY

	There was a Boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs 
	And islands of Winander! many a time, 
	At evening, when the earliest stars began 
	To move along the edges of the hills, 
	Rising or setting, would he stand alone, 
	Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake; 
	And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands 
	Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth 
	Uplifted, he, as through an instrument, 
	Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls 
	That they might answer him.--And they would shout 
	Across the watery vale, and shout again, 
	Responsive to his call,--with quivering peals, 
	And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud 
	Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild 
	Of jocund din! And, when there came a pause 
	Of silence such as baffled his best skill: 
	Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung 
	Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise 
	Has carried far into his heart the voice 
	Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene 
	Would enter unawares into his mind 
	With all its solemn imagery, its rocks, 
	Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received 
	Into the bosom of the steady lake. 
	
	This boy was taken from his mates, and died 
	In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old. 
	Pre-eminent in beauty is the vale 
	Where he was born and bred: the churchyard hangs 
	Upon a slope above the village-school; 
	And through that churchyard when my way has led 
	On summer-evenings, I believe that there 
	A long half-hour together I have stood 
	Mute--looking at the grave in which he lies!
