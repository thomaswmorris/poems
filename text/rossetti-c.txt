*** Christina Rossetti (1830 - 1894)


1. ADVENT

	This Advent moon shines cold and clear
	These Advent nights are long;
	Our lamps have burned year after year
	And still their flame is strong.
	“Watchman what of the night?“ we cry
	Heart-sick with hope deferred:
	“No speaking signs are in the sky”
	Is still the watchman’s word.

	The Porter watches at the gate
	The servants watch within;
	The watch is long betimes and late
	The prize is slow to win.
	“Watchman what of the night?“ but still
	His answer sounds the same:
	“No daybreak tops the utmost hill
	Nor pale our lamps of flame.”

	One to another hear them speak
	The patient virgins wise:
	“Surely He is not far to seek“--
	“All night we watch and rise.”
	“The days are evil looking back
	The coming days are dim;
	Yet count we not His promise slack
	But watch and wait for Him.”

	One with another soul with soul
	They kindle fire from fire:
	“Friends watch us who have touched the goal.”
	“They urge us come up higher.”
	“With them shall rest our waysore feet
	With them is built our home
	With Christ.“ “They sweet but He most sweet
	Sweeter than honeycomb.”

	There no more parting no more pain
	The distant ones brought near
	The lost so long are found again
	Long lost but longer dear:
	Eye hath not seen ear hath not heard
	Nor heart conceived that rest
	With them our good things long deferred
	With Jesus Christ our Best.

	We weep because the night is long
	We laugh for day shall rise
	We sing a slow contented song
	And knock at Paradise.
	Weeping we hold Him fast Who wept
	For us--we hold Him fast;
	And will not let Him go except
	He bless us first or last.

	Weeping we hold Him fast to-night;
	We will not let Him go
	Till daybreak smite our wearied sight
	And summer smite the snow:
	Then figs shall bud and dove with dove
	Shall coo the livelong day;
	Then He shall say “Arise My love
	My fair one come away.”



2. AFTER DEATH

	The curtains were half drawn, the floor was swept
	And strewn with rushes, rosemary and may
	Lay thick upon the bed on which I lay,
	Where through the lattice ivy-shadows crept.
	He leaned above me, thinking that I slept
	And could not hear him; but I heard him say,
	‘Poor child, poor child’: and as he turned away
	Came a deep silence, and I knew he wept.
	He did not touch the shroud, or raise the fold
	That hid my face, or take my hand in his,
	Or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head:
	He did not love me living; but once dead
	He pitied me; and very sweet it is
	To know he still is warm though I am cold.



3. ALL SAINTS

	They are flocking from the East
	And the West
	They are flocking from the North
	And the South
	Every moment setting forth
	From realm of snake or lion
	Swamp or sand
	Ice or burning;
	Greatest and least
	Palm in hand
	And praise in mouth
	They are flocking up the path
	To their rest
	Up the path that hath
	No returning.

	Up the steeps of Zion
	They are mounting
	Coming coming
	Throngs beyond man’s counting;
	With a sound
	Like innumerable bees
	Swarming humming
	Where flowering trees
	Many-tinted
	Many-scented
	All alike abound
	With honey--
	With a swell
	Like a blast upswaying unrestrainable
	From a shadowed dell
	To the hill-tops sunny--
	With a thunder
	Like the ocean when in strength
	Breadth and length
	It sets to shore;
	More and more
	Waves on waves redoubled pour
	Leaping flashing to the shore
	(Unlike the under
	Drain of ebb that loseth ground
	For all its roar.)

	They are thronging
	From the East and West
	From the North and South
	Saints are thronging loving longing
	To their land
	Of rest
	Palm in hand
	And praise in mouth.



4. AMOR MUNDI

	“Oh where are you going with your love-locks flowing
	On the west wind blowing along this valley track?”
	“The downhill path is easy, come with me an it please ye,
	We shall escape the uphill by never turning back.”

	So they two went together in glowing August weather,
	The honey-breathing heather lay to their left and right;
	And dear she was to dote on, her swift feet seemed to float on
	The air like soft twin pigeons too sportive to alight.

	“Oh what is that in heaven where gray cloud-flakes are seven,
	Where blackest clouds hang riven just at the rainy skirt?”
	“Oh that’s a meteor sent us, a message dumb, portentous,
	An undeciphered solemn signal of help or hurt.”

	“Oh what is that glides quickly where velvet flowers grow thickly,
	Their scent comes rich and sickly?”--“A scaled and hooded worm.”
	“Oh what’s that in the hollow, so pale I quake to follow?”
	“Oh that’s a thin dead body which waits the eternal term.”

	“Turn again, O my sweetest,--turn again, false and fleetest:
	This beaten way thou beatest I fear is hell’s own track.”
	“Nay, too steep for hill-mounting; nay, too late for cost-counting:
	This downhill path is easy, but there’s no turning back.”



5. ASCENSION DAY

	_“A Cloud received Him out of their sight.”_

	When Christ went up to Heaven the Apostles stayed
	Gazing at Heaven with souls and wills on fire
	Their hearts on flight along the track He made
	Winged by desire.

	Their silence spake: “Lord why not follow Thee?
	Home is not home without Thy Blessed Face
	Life is not life. Remember Lord and see
	Look back embrace.

	“Earth is one desert waste of banishment
	Life is one long-drawn anguish of decay.
	Where Thou wert wont to go we also went:
	Why not today?”

	Nevertheless a cloud cut off their gaze:
	They tarry to build up Jerusalem
	Watching for Him while thro’ the appointed days
	He watches them.

	They do His Will and doing it rejoice
	Patiently glad to spend and to be spent:
	Still He speaks to them still they hear His Voice
	And are content.

	For as a cloud received Him from their sight
	So with a cloud will He return ere long:
	Therefore they stand on guard by day by night
	Strenuous and strong.

	They do they dare they beyond seven times seven
	Forgive they cry God’s mighty word aloud:
	Yet sometimes haply lift tired eyes to Heaven--
	“Is that His cloud?”



6. A BETTER RESURRECTION

	I have no wit, no words, no tears;
	My heart within me like a stone
	Is numb’d too much for hopes or fears;
	Look right, look left, I dwell alone;
	I lift mine eyes, but dimm’d with grief
	No everlasting hills I see;
	My life is in the falling leaf:
	O Jesus, quicken me.

	My life is like a faded leaf,
	My harvest dwindled to a husk:
	Truly my life is void and brief
	And tedious in the barren dusk;
	My life is like a frozen thing,
	No bud nor greenness can I see:
	Yet rise it shall--the sap of Spring;
	O Jesus, rise in me.

	My life is like a broken bowl,
	A broken bowl that cannot hold
	One drop of water for my soul
	Or cordial in the searching cold;
	Cast in the fire the perish’d thing;
	Melt and remould it, till it be
	A royal cup for Him, my King:
	O Jesus, drink of me.



7. A CANDLEMAS DIALOGUE

	“Love brought Me down; and cannot love make thee
	Carol for joy to Me?
	Hear cheerful robin carol from his tree
	Who owes not half to Me
	I won for thee.”

	“Yea Lord I hear his carol’s wordless voice;
	And well may he rejoice
	Who hath not heard of death’s discordant noise.
	So might I too rejoice
	With such a voice.”

	“True thou hast compassed death; but hast not thou
	The tree of life’s own bough?
	Am I not Life and Resurrection now?
	My Cross balm-bearing bough
	For such as thou?”

	“Ah me Thy Cross!--but that seems far away;
	Thy Cradle-song to-day
	I too would raise and worship Thee and pray:
	Not empty Lord to-day
	Send me away.”

	“If thou wilt not go empty spend thy store;
	And I will give thee more
	Yea make thee ten times richer than before.
	Give more and give yet more
	Out of thy store.”

	“Because Thou givest me Thyself I will
	Thy blessed word fulfil
	Give with both hands and hoard by giving still;
	Thy pleasure to fulfil
	And work Thy Will.”



8. CRYING, MY LITTLE ONE

	Crying, my little one, footsore and weary?
	Fall asleep, pretty one, warm on my shoulder:
	I must tramp on through the winter night dreary,
	While the snow falls on me colder and colder.

	You are my one, and I have not another;
	Sleep soft, my darling, my trouble and treasure;
	Sleep warm and soft in the arms of your mother,
	Dreaming of pretty things, dreaming of pleasure.



9. A DAUGHTER OF EVE

	A fool I was to sleep at noon,
	And wake when night is chilly
	Beneath the comfortless cold moon;
	A fool to pluck my rose too soon,
	A fool to snap my lily.

	My garden-plot I have not kept;
	Faded and all-forsaken,
	I weep as I have never wept:
	Oh it was summer when I slept,
	It’s winter now I waken.

	Talk what you please of future spring
	And sun-warm’d sweet to-morrow:--
	Stripp’d bare of hope and everything,
	No more to laugh, no more to sing,
	I sit alone with sorrow.



10. DE PROFUNDIS

	Oh why is heaven built so far,
	Oh why is earth set so remote?
	I cannot reach the nearest star
	That hangs afloat.

	I would not care to reach the moon,
	One round monotonous of change;
	Yet even she repeats her tune
	Beyond my range.

	I never watch the scatter’d fire
	Of stars, or sun’s far-trailing train,
	But all my heart is one desire,
	And all in vain:

	For I am bound with fleshly bands,
	Joy, beauty, lie beyond my scope;
	I strain my heart, I stretch my hands,
	And catch at hope.



11. A DIRGE

	Why were you born when the snow was falling?
	You should have come to the cuckoo’s calling,
	Or when grapes are green in the cluster,
	Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster
	For their far off flying
	From summer dying.

	Why did you die when the lambs were cropping?
	You should have died at the apples’ dropping,
	When the grasshopper comes to trouble,
	And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble,
	And all winds go sighing
	For sweet things dying.



12. DREAM LAND

	Where sunless rivers weep
	Their waves into the deep,
	She sleeps a charmed sleep:
	Awake her not.
	Led by a single star,
	She came from very far
	To seek where shadows are
	Her pleasant lot.

	She left the rosy morn,
	She left the fields of corn,
	For twilight cold and lorn
	And water springs.
	Through sleep, as through a veil,
	She sees the sky look pale,
	And hears the nightingale
	That sadly sings.

	Rest, rest, a perfect rest
	Shed over brow and breast;
	Her face is toward the west,
	The purple land.
	She cannot see the grain
	Ripening on hill and plain;
	She cannot feel the rain
	Upon her hand.

	Rest, rest, for evermore
	Upon a mossy shore;
	Rest, rest at the heart’s core
	Till time shall cease:
	Sleep that no pain shall wake;
	Night that no morn shall break
	Till joy shall overtake
	Her perfect peace.



13. ECHO

	Come to me in the silence of the night;
	Come in the speaking silence of a dream;
	Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright
	As sunlight on a stream;
	Come back in tears,
	O memory, hope, love of finished years.

	Oh dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet,
	Whose wakening should have been in Paradise,
	Where souls brimfull of love abide and meet;
	Where thirsting longing eyes
	Watch the slow door
	That opening, letting in, lets out no more.

	Yet come to me in dreams, that I may live
	My very life again tho’ cold in death:
	Come back to me in dreams, that I may give
	Pulse for pulse, breath for breath:
	Speak low, lean low,
	As long ago, my love, how long ago.



14. EPIPHANY

	“Lord Babe, if Thou art He
	We sought for patiently,
	Where is Thy court?
	Hither may prophecy and star resort;
	Men heed not their report.”--
	“Bow down and worship, righteous man:
	This Infant of a span
	Is He man sought for since the world began!”--
	“Then, Lord, accept my gold, too base a thing
	For Thee, of all kings King.”--

	“Lord Babe, despite Thy youth
	I hold Thee of a truth
	Both Good and Great:
	But wherefore dost Thou keep so mean a state,
	Low-lying desolate?”--
	“Bow down and worship, righteous seer:
	The Lord our God is here
	Approachable, Who bids us all draw near.”--
	“Wherefore to Thee I offer frankincense,
	Thou Sole Omnipotence.”--

	“But I have only brought
	Myrrh; no wise afterthought
	Instructed me
	To gather pearls or gems, or choice to see
	Coral or ivory.”--
	“Not least thine offering proves thee wise:
	For myrrh means sacrifice,
	And He that lives, this Same is He that dies.”--
	“Then here is myrrh: alas! yea, woe is me
	That myrrh befitteth Thee.”--

	Myrrh, frankincense, and gold:
	And lo! from wintry fold
	Good-will doth bring
	A Lamb, the innocent likeness of this King
	Whom stars and seraphs sing:
	And lo! the bird of love, a Dove
	Flutters and coos above:
	And Dove and Lamb and Babe agree in love:--
	Come all mankind, come all creation hither,
	Come, worship Christ together.



15. EPIPHANYTIDE

	Trembling before Thee we fall down to adore Thee,
	Shamefaced and trembling we lift our eyes to Thee:
	O First and with the last! annul our ruined past,
	Rebuild us to Thy glory, set us free
	From sin and from sorrow to fall down and worship Thee.

	Full of pity view us, stretch Thy sceptre to us,
	Bid us live that we may give ourselves to Thee:
	O faithful Lord and True! stand up for us and do,
	Make us lovely, make us new, set us free--
	Heart and soul and spirit--to bring all and worship Thee.



16. FROM THE ANTIQUE

	It’s a weary life, it is, she said:
	Doubly blank in a woman’s lot:
	I wish and I wish I were a man:
	Or, better then any being, were not:

	Were nothing at all in all the world,
	Not a body and not a soul:
	Not so much as a grain of dust
	Or a drop of water from pole to pole.

	Still the world would wag on the same,
	Still the seasons go and come:
	Blossoms bloom as in days of old,
	Cherries ripen and wild bees hum.

	None would miss me in all the world,
	How much less would care or weep:
	I should be nothing, while all the rest
	Would wake and weary and fall asleep.



17. GOBLIN MARKET

	Morning and evening
	Maids heard the goblins cry:
	“Come buy our orchard fruits
	Come buy come buy:
	Apples and quinces
	Lemons and oranges
	Plump unpeck’d cherries
	Melons and raspberries
	Bloom-down-cheek’d peaches
	Swart-headed mulberries
	Wild free-born cranberries
	Crab-apples dewberries
	Pine-apples blackberries
	Apricots strawberries;--
	All ripe together
	In summer weather--
	Morns that pass by
	Fair eves that fly;
	Come buy come buy:
	Our grapes fresh from the vine
	Pomegranates full and fine
	Dates and sharp bullaces
	Rare pears and greengages
	Damsons and bilberries
	Taste them and try:
	Currants and gooseberries
	Bright-fire-like barberries
	Figs to fill your mouth
	Citrons from the South
	Sweet to tongue and sound to eye;
	Come buy come buy.”

	Evening by evening
	Among the brookside rushes
	Laura bow’d her head to hear
	Lizzie veil’d her blushes:
	Crouching close together
	In the cooling weather
	With clasping arms and cautioning lips
	With tingling cheeks and finger tips.
	“Lie close” Laura said
	Pricking up her golden head:
	“We must not look at goblin men
	We must not buy their fruits:
	Who knows upon what soil they fed
	Their hungry thirsty roots?”
	“Come buy” call the goblins
	Hobbling down the glen.

	“Oh” cried Lizzie “Laura Laura
	You should not peep at goblin men.”
	Lizzie cover’d up her eyes
	Cover’d close lest they should look;
	Laura rear’d her glossy head
	And whisper’d like the restless brook:
	“Look Lizzie look Lizzie
	Down the glen tramp little men.
	One hauls a basket
	One bears a plate
	One lugs a golden dish
	Of many pounds weight.
	How fair the vine must grow
	Whose grapes are so luscious;
	How warm the wind must blow
	Through those fruit bushes.”
	“No” said Lizzie “No no no;
	Their offers should not charm us
	Their evil gifts would harm us.”
	She thrust a dimpled finger
	In each ear shut eyes and ran:
	Curious Laura chose to linger
	Wondering at each merchant man.
	One had a cat’s face
	One whisk’d a tail
	One tramp’d at a rat’s pace
	One crawl’d like a snail
	One like a wombat prowl’d obtuse and furry
	One like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry.
	She heard a voice like voice of doves
	Cooing all together:
	They sounded kind and full of loves
	In the pleasant weather.

	Laura stretch’d her gleaming neck
	Like a rush-imbedded swan
	Like a lily from the beck
	Like a moonlit poplar branch
	Like a vessel at the launch
	When its last restraint is gone.

	Backwards up the mossy glen
	Turn’d and troop’d the goblin men
	With their shrill repeated cry
	“Come buy come buy.”
	When they reach’d where Laura was
	They stood stock still upon the moss
	Leering at each other
	Brother with queer brother;
	Signalling each other
	Brother with sly brother.
	One set his basket down
	One rear’d his plate;
	One began to weave a crown
	Of tendrils leaves and rough nuts brown
	(Men sell not such in any town);
	One heav’d the golden weight
	Of dish and fruit to offer her:
	“Come buy come buy” was still their cry.
	Laura stared but did not stir
	Long’d but had no money:
	The whisk-tail’d merchant bade her taste
	In tones as smooth as honey
	The cat-faced purr’d
	The rat-faced spoke a word
	Of welcome and the snail-paced even was heard;
	One parrot-voiced and jolly
	Cried “Pretty Goblin” still for “Pretty Polly;”--
	One whistled like a bird.

	But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:
	“Good folk I have no coin;
	To take were to purloin:
	I have no copper in my purse
	I have no silver either
	And all my gold is on the furze
	That shakes in windy weather
	Above the rusty heather.”
	“You have much gold upon your head”
	They answer’d all together:
	“Buy from us with a golden curl.”
	She clipp’d a precious golden lock
	She dropp’d a tear more rare than pearl
	Then suck’d their fruit globes fair or red:
	Sweeter than honey from the rock
	Stronger than man-rejoicing wine
	Clearer than water flow’d that juice;
	She never tasted such before
	How should it cloy with length of use?
	She suck’d and suck’d and suck’d the more
	Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;
	She suck’d until her lips were sore;
	Then flung the emptied rinds away
	But gather’d up one kernel stone
	And knew not was it night or day
	As she turn’d home alone.

	Lizzie met her at the gate
	Full of wise upbraidings:
	“Dear you should not stay so late
	Twilight is not good for maidens;
	Should not loiter in the glen
	In the haunts of goblin men.
	Do you not remember Jeanie
	How she met them in the moonlight
	Took their gifts both choice and many
	Ate their fruits and wore their flowers
	Pluck’d from bowers
	Where summer ripens at all hours?
	But ever in the noonlight
	She pined and pined away;
	Sought them by night and day
	Found them no more but dwindled and grew grey;
	Then fell with the first snow
	While to this day no grass will grow
	Where she lies low:
	I planted daisies there a year ago
	That never blow.
	You should not loiter so.”
	“Nay hush” said Laura:
	“Nay hush my sister:
	I ate and ate my fill
	Yet my mouth waters still;
	To-morrow night I will
	Buy more;” and kiss’d her:
	“Have done with sorrow;
	I’ll bring you plums to-morrow
	Fresh on their mother twigs
	Cherries worth getting;
	You cannot think what figs
	My teeth have met in
	What melons icy-cold
	Piled on a dish of gold
	Too huge for me to hold
	What peaches with a velvet nap
	Pellucid grapes without one seed:
	Odorous indeed must be the mead
	Whereon they grow and pure the wave they drink
	With lilies at the brink
	And sugar-sweet their sap.”

	Golden head by golden head
	Like two pigeons in one nest
	Folded in each other’s wings
	They lay down in their curtain’d bed:
	Like two blossoms on one stem
	Like two flakes of new-fall’n snow
	Like two wands of ivory
	Tipp’d with gold for awful kings.
	Moon and stars gaz’d in at them
	Wind sang to them lullaby
	Lumbering owls forbore to fly
	Not a bat flapp’d to and fro
	Round their rest:
	Cheek to cheek and breast to breast
	Lock’d together in one nest.

	Early in the morning
	When the first cock crow’d his warning
	Neat like bees as sweet and busy
	Laura rose with Lizzie:
	Fetch’d in honey milk’d the cows
	Air’d and set to rights the house
	Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat
	Cakes for dainty mouths to eat
	Next churn’d butter whipp’d up cream
	Fed their poultry sat and sew’d;
	Talk’d as modest maidens should:
	Lizzie with an open heart
	Laura in an absent dream
	One content one sick in part;
	One warbling for the mere bright day’s delight
	One longing for the night.

	At length slow evening came:
	They went with pitchers to the reedy brook;
	Lizzie most placid in her look
	Laura most like a leaping flame.
	They drew the gurgling water from its deep;
	Lizzie pluck’d purple and rich golden flags
	Then turning homeward said: “The sunset flushes
	Those furthest loftiest crags;
	Come Laura not another maiden lags.
	No wilful squirrel wags
	The beasts and birds are fast asleep.”
	But Laura loiter’d still among the rushes
	And said the bank was steep.

	And said the hour was early still
	The dew not fall’n the wind not chill;
	Listening ever but not catching
	The customary cry
	“Come buy come buy”
	With its iterated jingle
	Of sugar-baited words:
	Not for all her watching
	Once discerning even one goblin
	Racing whisking tumbling hobbling;
	Let alone the herds
	That used to tramp along the glen
	In groups or single
	Of brisk fruit-merchant men.

	Till Lizzie urged “O Laura come;
	I hear the fruit-call but I dare not look:
	You should not loiter longer at this brook:
	Come with me home.
	The stars rise the moon bends her arc
	Each glowworm winks her spark
	Let us get home before the night grows dark:
	For clouds may gather
	Though this is summer weather
	Put out the lights and drench us through;
	Then if we lost our way what should we do?”

	Laura turn’d cold as stone
	To find her sister heard that cry alone
	That goblin cry
	“Come buy our fruits come buy.”
	Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit?
	Must she no more such succous pasture find
	Gone deaf and blind?
	Her tree of life droop’d from the root:
	She said not one word in her heart’s sore ache;
	But peering thro’ the dimness nought discerning
	Trudg’d home her pitcher dripping all the way;
	So crept to bed and lay
	Silent till Lizzie slept;
	Then sat up in a passionate yearning
	And gnash’d her teeth for baulk’d desire and wept
	As if her heart would break.

	Day after day night after night
	Laura kept watch in vain
	In sullen silence of exceeding pain.
	She never caught again the goblin cry:
	“Come buy come buy;”--
	She never spied the goblin men
	Hawking their fruits along the glen:
	But when the noon wax’d bright
	Her hair grew thin and grey;
	She dwindled as the fair full moon doth turn
	To swift decay and burn
	Her fire away.

	One day remembering her kernel-stone
	She set it by a wall that faced the south;
	Dew’d it with tears hoped for a root
	Watch’d for a waxing shoot
	But there came none;
	It never saw the sun
	It never felt the trickling moisture run:
	While with sunk eyes and faded mouth
	She dream’d of melons as a traveller sees
	False waves in desert drouth
	With shade of leaf-crown’d trees
	And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.

	She no more swept the house
	Tended the fowls or cows
	Fetch’d honey kneaded cakes of wheat
	Brought water from the brook:
	But sat down listless in the chimney-nook
	And would not eat.

	Tender Lizzie could not bear
	To watch her sister’s cankerous care
	Yet not to share.
	She night and morning
	Caught the goblins’ cry:
	“Come buy our orchard fruits
	Come buy come buy;”--
	Beside the brook along the glen
	She heard the tramp of goblin men
	The yoke and stir
	Poor Laura could not hear;
	Long’d to buy fruit to comfort her
	But fear’d to pay too dear.
	She thought of Jeanie in her grave
	Who should have been a bride;
	But who for joys brides hope to have
	Fell sick and died
	In her gay prime
	In earliest winter time
	With the first glazing rime
	With the first snow-fall of crisp winter time.

	Till Laura dwindling
	Seem’d knocking at Death’s door:
	Then Lizzie weigh’d no more
	Better and worse;
	But put a silver penny in her purse
	Kiss’d Laura cross’d the heath with clumps of furze
	At twilight halted by the brook:
	And for the first time in her life
	Began to listen and look.

	Laugh’d every goblin
	When they spied her peeping:
	Came towards her hobbling
	Flying running leaping
	Puffing and blowing
	Chuckling clapping crowing
	Clucking and gobbling
	Mopping and mowing
	Full of airs and graces
	Pulling wry faces
	Demure grimaces
	Cat-like and rat-like
	Ratel- and wombat-like
	Snail-paced in a hurry
	Parrot-voiced and whistler
	Helter skelter hurry skurry
	Chattering like magpies
	Fluttering like pigeons
	Gliding like fishes--
	Hugg’d her and kiss’d her:
	Squeez’d and caress’d her:
	Stretch’d up their dishes
	Panniers and plates:
	“Look at our apples
	Russet and dun
	Bob at our cherries
	Bite at our peaches
	Citrons and dates
	Grapes for the asking
	Pears red with basking
	Out in the sun
	Plums on their twigs;
	Pluck them and suck them
	Pomegranates figs.”--

	“Good folk” said Lizzie
	Mindful of Jeanie:
	“Give me much and many: --
	Held out her apron
	Toss’d them her penny.
	“Nay take a seat with us
	Honour and eat with us”
	They answer’d grinning:
	“Our feast is but beginning.
	Night yet is early
	Warm and dew-pearly
	Wakeful and starry:
	Such fruits as these
	No man can carry:
	Half their bloom would fly
	Half their dew would dry
	Half their flavour would pass by.
	Sit down and feast with us
	Be welcome guest with us
	Cheer you and rest with us.”--
	“Thank you” said Lizzie: “But one waits
	At home alone for me:
	So without further parleying
	If you will not sell me any
	Of your fruits though much and many
	Give me back my silver penny
	I toss’d you for a fee.”--
	They began to scratch their pates
	No longer wagging purring
	But visibly demurring
	Grunting and snarling.
	One call’d her proud
	Cross-grain’d uncivil;
	Their tones wax’d loud
	Their looks were evil.
	Lashing their tails
	They trod and hustled her
	Elbow’d and jostled her
	Claw’d with their nails
	Barking mewing hissing mocking
	Tore her gown and soil’d her stocking
	Twitch’d her hair out by the roots
	Stamp’d upon her tender feet
	Held her hands and squeez’d their fruits
	Against her mouth to make her eat.

	White and golden Lizzie stood
	Like a lily in a flood--
	Like a rock of blue-vein’d stone
	Lash’d by tides obstreperously--
	Like a beacon left alone
	In a hoary roaring sea
	Sending up a golden fire--
	Like a fruit-crown’d orange-tree
	White with blossoms honey-sweet
	Sore beset by wasp and bee--
	Like a royal virgin town
	Topp’d with gilded dome and spire
	Close beleaguer’d by a fleet
	Mad to tug her standard down.

	One may lead a horse to water
	Twenty cannot make him drink.
	Though the goblins cuff’d and caught her
	Coax’d and fought her
	Bullied and besought her
	Scratch’d her pinch’d her black as ink
	Kick’d and knock’d her
	Maul’d and mock’d her
	Lizzie utter’d not a word;
	Would not open lip from lip
	Lest they should cram a mouthful in:
	But laugh’d in heart to feel the drip
	Of juice that syrupp’d all her face
	And lodg’d in dimples of her chin
	And streak’d her neck which quaked like curd.
	At last the evil people
	Worn out by her resistance
	Flung back her penny kick’d their fruit
	Along whichever road they took
	Not leaving root or stone or shoot;
	Some writh’d into the ground
	Some div’d into the brook
	With ring and ripple
	Some scudded on the gale without a sound
	Some vanish’d in the distance.

	In a smart ache tingle
	Lizzie went her way;
	Knew not was it night or day;
	Sprang up the bank tore thro’ the furze
	Threaded copse and dingle
	And heard her penny jingle
	Bouncing in her purse--
	Its bounce was music to her ear.
	She ran and ran
	As if she fear’d some goblin man
	Dogg’d her with gibe or curse
	Or something worse:
	But not one goblin scurried after
	Nor was she prick’d by fear;
	The kind heart made her windy-paced
	That urged her home quite out of breath with haste
	And inward laughter.

	She cried “Laura” up the garden
	“Did you miss me?
	Come and kiss me.
	Never mind my bruises
	Hug me kiss me suck my juices
	Squeez’d from goblin fruits for you
	Goblin pulp and goblin dew.
	Eat me drink me love me;
	Laura make much of me;
	For your sake I have braved the glen
	And had to do with goblin merchant men.”

	Laura started from her chair
	Flung her arms up in the air
	Clutch’d her hair:
	“Lizzie Lizzie have you tasted
	For my sake the fruit forbidden?
	Must your light like mine be hidden
	Your young life like mine be wasted
	Undone in mine undoing
	And ruin’d in my ruin
	Thirsty canker’d goblin-ridden?”--
	She clung about her sister
	Kiss’d and kiss’d and kiss’d her:
	Tears once again
	Refresh’d her shrunken eyes
	Dropping like rain
	After long sultry drouth;
	Shaking with aguish fear and pain
	She kiss’d and kiss’d her with a hungry mouth.

	Her lips began to scorch
	That juice was wormwood to her tongue
	She loath’d the feast:
	Writhing as one possess’d she leap’d and sung
	Rent all her robe and wrung
	Her hands in lamentable haste
	And beat her breast.
	Her locks stream’d like the torch
	Borne by a racer at full speed
	Or like the mane of horses in their flight
	Or like an eagle when she stems the light
	Straight toward the sun
	Or like a caged thing freed
	Or like a flying flag when armies run.

	Swift fire spread through her veins knock’d at her heart
	Met the fire smouldering there
	And overbore its lesser flame;
	She gorged on bitterness without a name:
	Ah! fool to choose such part
	Of soul-consuming care!
	Sense fail’d in the mortal strife:
	Like the watch-tower of a town
	Which an earthquake shatters down
	Like a lightning-stricken mast
	Like a wind-uprooted tree
	Spun about
	Like a foam-topp’d waterspout
	Cast down headlong in the sea
	She fell at last;
	Pleasure past and anguish past
	Is it death or is it life?

	Life out of death.
	That night long Lizzie watch’d by her
	Counted her pulse’s flagging stir
	Felt for her breath
	Held water to her lips and cool’d her face
	With tears and fanning leaves:
	But when the first birds chirp’d about their eaves
	And early reapers plodded to the place
	Of golden sheaves
	And dew-wet grass
	Bow’d in the morning winds so brisk to pass
	And new buds with new day
	Open’d of cup-like lilies on the stream
	Laura awoke as from a dream
	Laugh’d in the innocent old way
	Hugg’d Lizzie but not twice or thrice;
	Her gleaming locks show’d not one thread of grey
	Her breath was sweet as May
	And light danced in her eyes.

	Days weeks months years
	Afterwards when both were wives
	With children of their own;
	Their mother-hearts beset with fears
	Their lives bound up in tender lives;
	Laura would call the little ones
	And tell them of her early prime
	Those pleasant days long gone
	Of not-returning time:
	Would talk about the haunted glen
	The wicked quaint fruit-merchant men
	Their fruits like honey to the throat
	But poison in the blood;
	(Men sell not such in any town):
	Would tell them how her sister stood
	In deadly peril to do her good
	And win the fiery antidote:
	Then joining hands to little hands
	Would bid them cling together
	“For there is no friend like a sister
	In calm or stormy weather;
	To cheer one on the tedious way
	To fetch one if one goes astray
	To lift one if one totters down
	To strengthen whilst one stands.”



18. GOOD FRIDAY

	Am I a stone and not a sheep
	That I can stand O Christ beneath Thy Cross
	To number drop by drop Thy Blood’s slow loss
	And yet not weep?

	Not so those women loved
	Who with exceeding grief lamented Thee;
	Not so fallen Peter weeping bitterly;
	Not so the thief was moved;

	Not so the Sun and Moon
	Which hid their faces in a starless sky
	A horror of great darkness at broad noon--
	I only I.

	Yet give not o’er
	But seek Thy sheep true Shepherd of the flock;
	Greater than Moses turn and look once more
	And smite a rock.



19. I LOVED YOU FIRST

	_Poca favilla gran fiamma seconda._ --Dante

	Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,
	E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore. --Petrarca

	I loved you first: but afterwards your love
	Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
	As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.
	Which owes the other most? my love was long,
	And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;
	I loved and guessed at you, you construed me
	And loved me for what might or might not be--
	Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
	For verily love knows not ‘mine’ or ‘thine;’
	With separate ‘I’ and ‘thou’ free love has done,
	For one is both and both are one in love:
	Rich love knows nought of ‘thine that is not mine;’
	Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
	Both of us, of the love which makes us one.



20. I WISH I COULD REMEMBER 

	_Era gia l’ora che volge il desio._ --Dante
	Ricorro al tempo ch’io vi vidi prima. --Petrarca

	I wish I could remember that first day,
	First hour, first moment of your meeting me,
	If bright or dim the season, it might be
	Summer or Winter for aught I can say;
	So unrecorded did it slip away,
	So blind was I to see and to foresee,
	So dull to mark the budding of my tree
	That would not blossom yet for many a May.
	If only I could recollect it, such
	A day of days! I let it come and go
	As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;
	It seemed to mean so little, meant so much;
	If only now I could recall that touch,
	First touch of hand in hand--Did one but know!



21. IF THOU SAYEST BEHOLD WE KNEW IT NOT

	--_Proverbs xxiv. 11 12._

	I

	I have done I know not what--what have I done?
	My brother’s blood my brother’s soul doth cry:
	And I find no defence find no reply
	No courage more to run this race I run
	Not knowing what I have done have left undone;
	Ah me these awful unknown hours that fly
	Fruitless it may be fleeting fruitless by
	Rank with death-savor underneath the sun.
	For what avails it that I did not know
	The deed I did? what profits me the plea
	That had I known I had not wronged him so?
	Lord Jesus Christ my God him pity Thou;
	Lord if it may be pity also me:
	In judgment pity and in death and now.


	II

	Thou Who hast borne all burdens bear our load
	Bear Thou our load whatever load it be;
	Our guilt our shame our helpless misery
	Bear Thou Who only canst O God my God.
	Seek us and find us for we cannot Thee
	Or seek or find or hold or cleave unto:
	We cannot do or undo; Lord undo
	Our self-undoing for Thine is the key
	Of all we are not though we might have been.
	Dear Lord if ever mercy moved Thy mind
	If so be love of us can move Thee yet
	If still the nail-prints in Thy Hands are seen
	Remember us--yea how shouldst Thou forget?
	Remember us for good and seek and find.


	III

	Each soul I might have succored may have slain
	All souls shall face me at the last Appeal
	That great last moment poised for woe or weal
	That final moment for man’s bliss or bane.
	Vanity of vanities yea all is vain
	Which then will not avail or help or heal:
	Disfeatured faces worn-out knees that kneel
	Will more avail than strength or beauty then.
	Lord by Thy Passion--when Thy Face was marred
	In sight of earth and hell tumultuous
	And Thy heart failed in Thee like melting wax
	And Thy Blood dropped more precious than the nard--
	Lord for Thy sake not ours supply our lacks
	For Thine own sake not ours Christ pity us.



22. IN AN ARTIST’S STUDIO

	One face looks out from all his canvases,
	One selfsame figure sits or walks or leans:
	We found her hidden just behind those screens,
	That mirror gave back all her loveliness.
	A queen in opal or in ruby dress,
	A nameless girl in freshest summer-greens,
	A saint, an angel--every canvas means
	The same one meaning, neither more or less.
	He feeds upon her face by day and night,
	And she with true kind eyes looks back on him,
	Fair as the moon and joyful as the light:
	Not wan with waiting, not with sorrow dim;
	Not as she is, but was when hope shone bright;
	Not as she is, but as she fills his dream.



23. IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER

	In the bleak midwinter frosty wind made moan
	Earth stood hard as iron water like a stone;
	Snow had fallen snow on snow snow on snow
	In the bleak midwinter long ago.

	Our God Heaven cannot hold Him nor earth sustain;
	Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.
	In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
	The Lord God Almighty Jesus Christ.

	Enough for Him whom cherubim worship night and day
	Breastful of milk and a mangerful of hay;
	Enough for Him whom angels fall before
	The ox and ass and camel which adore.

	Angels and archangels may have gathered there
	Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
	But His mother only in her maiden bliss
	Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.

	What can I give Him poor as I am?
	If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb;
	If I were a Wise Man I would do my part;
	Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.



24. LOVE CAME DOWN AT CHRISTMAS

	Love came down at Christmas,
	Love all lovely, Love Divine,
	Love was born at Christmas,
	Star and Angels gave the sign.

	Worship we the Godhead,
	Love Incarnate, Love Divine,
	Worship we our Jesus,
	But wherewith for sacred sign?

	Love shall be our token,
	Love be yours and love be mine,
	Love to God and all men,
	Love for plea and gift and sign.



25. MANY IN AFTERTIMES WILL SAY OF YOU

	_Vien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti._ --Dante
	Contando i casi della vita nostra. --Petrarca

	Many in aftertimes will say of you
	‘He loved her’--while of me what will they say?
	Not that I loved you more than just in play,
	For fashion’s sake as idle women do.
	Even let them prate; who know not what we knew
	Of love and parting in exceeding pain.
	Of parting hopeless here to meet again,
	Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.
	But by my heart of love laid bare to you.
	My love that you can make not void nor vain,
	Love that foregoes you but to claim anew
	Beyond this passage of the gate of death,
	I charge you at the Judgment make it plain
	My love of you was life and not a breath.



26. MY SECRET

	I tell my secret? No indeed not I:
	Perhaps some day who knows?
	But not to-day; it froze and blows and snows
	And you’re too curious: fie!
	You want to hear it? well:
	Only my secret’s mine and I won’t tell.

	Or after all perhaps there’s none:
	Suppose there is no secret after all
	But only just my fun.
	To-day’s a nipping day a biting day;
	In which one wants a shawl
	A veil a cloak and other wraps:
	I cannot ope to every one who taps
	And let the draughts come whistling through my hall;
	Come bounding and surrounding me
	Come buffeting astounding me
	Nipping and clipping through my wraps and all.
	I wear my mask for warmth: who ever shows
	His nose to Russian snows
	To be pecked at by every wind that blows?
	You would not peck? I thank you for good-will
	Believe but leave that truth untested still.

	Spring’s an expansive time: yet I don’t trust
	March with its peck of dust
	Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers
	Nor even May whose flowers
	One frost may wither through the sunless hours.

	Perhaps some languid summer day
	When drowsy birds sing less and less
	And golden fruit is ripening to excess
	If there’s not too much sun nor too much cloud
	And the warm wind is neither still nor loud
	Perhaps my secret I may say
	Or you may guess.



27. NO, THANK YOU, JOHN

	I never said I loved you, John:
	Why will you tease me, day by day,
	And wax a weariness to think upon
	With always “do” and “pray”?

	You know I never loved you, John;
	No fault of mine made me your toast:
	Why will you haunt me with a face as wan
	As shows an hour--old ghost?

	I dare say Meg or Moll would take
	Pity upon you, if you’d ask:
	And pray don’t remain single for my sake
	Who can’t perform that task.

	I have no heart?--Perhaps I have not;
	But then you’re mad to take offence
	That I don’t give you what I have not got:
	Use your common sense.

	Let bygones be bygones:
	Don’t call me false, who owed not to be true:
	I’d rather answer “No” to fifty Johns
	Than answer “Yes” to you.

	Let’s mar our pleasant days no more,
	Song-birds of passage, days of youth:
	Catch at to-day, forget the days before:
	I’ll wink at your untruth.

	Let us strike hands as hearty friends;
	No more, no less: and friendship’s good:
	Only don’t keep in view ulterior ends,
	And points not understood

	In open treaty. Rise above
	Quibbles and shuffling off and on:
	Here’s friendship for you if you like; but love,--
	No, thank you, John.




28. OLD AND NEW YEAR DITTIES

	I

	New Year met me somewhat sad:
	Old Year leaves me tired
	Stripped of favorite things I had
	Balked of much desired:
	Yet farther on my road to-day
	God willing farther on my way.

	New Year coming on apace
	What have you to give me?
	Bring you scathe or bring you grace
	Face me with an honest face;
	You shall not deceive me:
	Be it good or ill be it what you will
	It needs shall help me on my road
	My rugged way to heaven please God.


	II

	Watch with me men women and children dear
	You whom I love for whom I hope and fear
	Watch with me this last vigil of the year.
	Some hug their business some their pleasure-scheme;
	Some seize the vacant hour to sleep or dream;
	Heart locked in heart some kneel and watch apart.

	Watch with me blessed spirits who delight
	All through the holy night to walk in white
	Or take your ease after the long-drawn fight.
	I know not if they watch with me: I know
	They count this eve of resurrection slow
	And cry “How long?“ with urgent utterance strong.

	Watch with me Jesus in my loneliness:
	Though others say me nay yet say Thou yes;
	Though others pass me by stop Thou to bless.
	Yea Thou dost stop with me this vigil night;
	To-night of pain to-morrow of delight:
	I Love am Thine; Thou Lord my God art mine.


	III

	Passing away saith the World passing away:
	Chances beauty and youth sapped day by day:
	Thy life never continueth in one stay.
	Is the eye waxen dim is the dark hair changing to gray
	That hath won neither laurel nor bay?
	I shall clothe myself in Spring and bud in May:
	Thou root-stricken shalt not rebuild thy decay
	On my bosom for aye.
	Then I answered: Yea.

	Passing away saith my Soul passing away:
	With its burden of fear and hope of labor and play;
	Hearken what the past doth witness and say:
	Rust in thy gold a moth is in thine array
	A canker is in thy bud thy leaf must decay.
	At midnight at cock-crow at morning one certain day
	Lo the Bridegroom shall come and shall not delay:
	Watch thou and pray.
	Then I answered: Yea.

	Passing away saith my God passing away:
	Winter passeth after the long delay:
	New grapes on the vine new figs on the tender spray
	Turtle calleth turtle in Heaven’s May.
	Though I tarry wait for Me trust Me watch and pray.
	Arise come away night is past and lo it is day
	My love My sister My spouse thou shalt hear Me say.
	Then I answered: Yea.



29. A PROCESSIONAL OF CREATION

	_All._

	I All-Creation sing my song of praise
	To God Who made me and vouchsafes my days
	And sends me forth by multitudinous ways.


	_Seraph._

	I like my Brethren burn eternally
	With love of Him Who is Love and loveth me;
	The Holy Holy Holy Unity.


	_Cherub._

	I with my Brethren gaze eternally
	On Him Who is Wisdom and Who knoweth me;
	The Holy Holy Holy Trinity.


	_All Angels._

	We rule we serve we work we store His treasure
	Whose vessels are we brimmed with strength and pleasure;
	Our joys fulfil yea overfill our measure.


	_Heavens._

	We float before the Presence Infinite
	We cluster round the Throne in our delight
	Revolving and rejoicing in God’s sight.


	_Firmament._

	I blue and beautiful and framed of air
	At sunrise and at sunset grow most fair;
	His glory by my glories I declare.


	_Powers._

	We Powers are powers because He makes us strong;
	Wherefore we roll all rolling orbs along
	We move all moving things and sing our song.


	_Sun._

	I blaze to Him in mine engarlanding
	Of rays I flame His whole burnt-offering
	While as a bridegroom I rejoice and sing.


	_Moon._

	I follow and am fair and do His Will;
	Through all my changes I am faithful still
	Full-orbed or strait His mandate to fulfil.


	_Stars._

	We Star-hosts numerous innumerous
	Throng space with energy untumultuous
	And work His Will Whose eye beholdeth us.


	_Galaxies and Nebulæ._

	No thing is far or near; and therefore we
	Float neither far nor near; but where we be
	Weave dances round the Throne perpetually.


	_Comets and Meteors._

	Our lights dart here and there whirl to and fro
	We flash and vanish we die down and glow;
	All doing His Will Who bids us do it so.


	_Showers._

	We give ourselves; and be we great or small
	Thus are we made like Him Who giveth all
	Like Him Whose gracious pleasure bids us fall.


	_Dews._

	We give ourselves in silent secret ways
	Spending and spent in silence full of grace;
	And thus are made like God and show His praise.


	_Winds._

	We sift the air and winnow all the earth;
	And God Who poised our weights and weighs our worth
	Accepts the worship of our solemn mirth.


	_Fire._

	My power and strength are His Who fashioned me
	Ordained me image of His Jealousy
	Forged me His weapon fierce exceedingly.


	_Heat._

	I glow unto His glory and do good:
	I glow and bring to life both bud and brood;
	I glow and ripen harvest-crops for food.


	_Winter and Summer._

	Our wealth and joys and beauties celebrate
	His wealth of beauty Who sustains our state
	Before Whose changelessness we alternate.


	_Spring and Autumn._

	I hope--and I remember--we give place
	Either to other with contented grace
	Acceptable and lovely all our days.


	_Frost._

	I make the unstable stable binding fast
	The world of waters prone to ripple past:
	Thus praise I God Whose mercies I forecast.


	_Cold._

	I rouse and goad the slothful apt to nod
	I stir and urge the laggards with my rod:
	My praise is not of men yet I praise God.


	_Snow._

	My whiteness shadoweth Him Who is most fair
	All spotless: yea my whiteness which I wear
	Exalts His Purity beyond compare.


	_Vapors._

	We darken sun and moon and blot the day
	The good Will of our Maker to obey:
	Till to the glory of God we pass away.


	_Night._

	Moon and all stars I don for diadem
	To make me fair: I cast myself and them
	Before His feet Who knows us gem from gem.


	_Day._

	I shout before Him in my plenitude
	Of light and warmth of hope and wealth and food;
	Ascribing all good to the Only Good.


	_Light and Darkness._

	I am God’s dwelling-place--And also I
	Make His pavilion--Lo we bide and fly
	Exulting in the Will of God Most High.


	_Lightning and Thunder._

	We indivisible flash forth His Fame
	We thunder forth the glory of His Name
	In harmony of resonance and flame.


	_Clouds._

	Sweet is our store exhaled from sea or river:
	We wear a rainbow praising God the Giver
	Because His mercy is for ever and ever.


	_Earth._

	I rest in Him rejoicing: resting so
	And so rejoicing in that I am low;
	Yet known of Him and following on to know.


	_Mountains._

	Our heights which laud Him sink abased before
	Him higher than the highest evermore:
	God higher than the highest we adore.


	_Hills._

	We green-tops praise Him and we fruitful heads
	Whereon the sunshine and the dew He sheds:
	We green-tops praise Him rising from out beds.


	_Green Things._

	With plumes of softness and a note of love--
	We praise by divers gifts One God above.

	We border-loving Creatures of the wave--
	We praise our King with voices deep and grave.


	_Small Animals._

	God forms us weak and small but pours out all
	We need and notes us while we stand or fall:
	Wherefore we praise Him weak and safe and small.


	_Lamb._

	I praise my loving Lord Who maketh me
	His type by harmless sweet simplicity:
	Yet He the Lamb of lambs incomparably.

	I praise the Lion of the Royal Race

	With all my might I leap and lavish praise.


	_All Men._

	All creatures sing around us and we sing:
	We bring our own selves as our offering
	Our very selves we render to our King.


	_Israel._

	Flock of our Shepherd’s pasture and His fold

	Praise God praise God praise God His creature saith.



30. REMEMBER

	Remember me when I am gone away
	Gone far away into the silent land;
	When you can no more hold me by the hand
	Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
	Remember me when no more day by day
	You tell me of our future that you planned:
	Only remember me; you understand
	It will be late to counsel then or pray.
	Yet if you should forget me for a while
	And afterwards remember do not grieve:
	For if the darkness and corruption leave
	A vestige of the thoughts that once I had
	Better by far you should forget and smile
	Than that you should remember and be sad.



31. SHUT OUT

	The door was shut. I looked between
	Its iron bars; and saw it lie
	My garden mine beneath the sky
	Pied with all flowers bedewed and green:

	From bough to bough the song-birds crossed
	From flower to flower the moths and bees;
	With all its nests and stately trees
	It had been mine and it was lost.

	A shadowless spirit kept the gate
	Blank and unchanging like the grave.
	I peering through said: “Let me have
	Some buds to cheer my outcast state.”

	He answered not. “Or give me then
	But one small twig from shrub or tree;
	And bid my home remember me
	Until I come to it again.”

	The spirit was silent; but he took
	Mortar and stone to build a wall;
	He left no loophole great or small
	Through which my straining eyes might look:

	So now I sit here quite alone
	Blinded with tears; nor grieve for that
	For naught is left worth looking at
	Since my delightful land is gone.

	A violet bed is budding near
	Wherein a lark has made her nest:
	And good they are but not the best;
	And dear they are but not so dear.



32. SOMEWHERE OR OTHER

	Somewhere or other there must surely be
	The face not seen, the voice not heard,
	The heart that not yet--never yet--ah me!
	Made answer to my word.

	Somewhere or other, may be near or far;
	Past land and sea, clean out of sight;
	Beyond the wandering moon, beyond the star
	That tracks her night by night.

	Somewhere or other, may be far or near;
	With just a wall, a hedge, between;
	With just the last leaves of the dying year
	Fallen on a turf grown green.



33. A STUDY

	She stands as pale as Parian statues stand;
	Like Cleopatra when she turned at bay,
	And felt her strength above the Roman sway,
	And felt the aspic writhing in her hand.
	Her face is steadfast toward the shadowy land,
	For dim beyond it looms the light of day;
	Her feet are steadfast; all the arduous way
	That foot-track hath not wavered on the sand.
	She stands there like a beacon thro’ the night,
	A pale clear beacon where the storm-drift is;
	She stands alone, a wonder deathly white;
	She stands there patient, nerved with inner might,
	Indomitable in her feebleness,
	Her face and will athirst against the light.



34. THE THREE ENEMIES

	_The Flesh_

	“Sweet thou art pale.”
	“More pale to see
	Christ hung upon the cruel tree
	And bore His Father’s wrath for me.”

	“Sweet thou art sad.”
	“Beneath a rod
	More heavy Christ for my sake trod
	The winepress of the wrath of God.”

	“Sweet thou art weary.”
	“Not so Christ:
	Whose mighty love of me sufficed
	For Strength Salvation Eucharist.”

	“Sweet thou art footsore.”
	“If I bleed
	His feet have bled: yea in my need
	His Heart once bled for mine indeed.”


	_The World_

	“Sweet thou art young.”
	“So He was young
	Who for my sake in silence hung
	Upon the Cross with Passion wrung.”

	“Look thou art fair.”
	“He was more fair
	Than men Who deigned for me to wear
	A visage marred beyond compare.”

	“And thou hast riches.”
	“Daily bread:
	All else is His; Who living dead
	For me lacked where to lay His Head.”

	“And life is sweet.”
	“It was not so
	To Him Whose Cup did overflow
	With mine unutterable woe.”


	_The Devil_

	“Thou drinkest deep.”
	“When Christ would sup
	He drained the dregs from out my cup:
	So how should I be lifted up?”

	“Thou shalt win Glory.”
	“In the skies
	Lord Jesus cover up mine eyes
	Lest they should look on vanities.”

	“Thou shalt have Knowledge.”
	“Helpless dust
	In Thee O Lord I put my trust:
	Answer Thou for me Wise and Just.”

	“And Might.”
	“Get thee behind me. Lord
	Who hast redeemed and not abhorred
	My soul O keep it by Thy Word.”



35. A TRIAD

	Three sang of love together: one with lips
	Crimson, with cheeks and bosom in a glow,
	Flushed to the yellow hair and finger tips;
	And one there sang who soft and smooth as snow
	Bloomed like a tinted hyacinth at a show;
	And one was blue with famine after love,
	Who like a harpstring snapped rang harsh and low
	The burden of what those were singing of.
	One shamed herself in love; one temperately
	Grew gross in soulless love, a sluggish wife;
	One famished died for love. Thus two of three
	Took death for love and won him after strife;
	One droned in sweetness like a fattened bee:
	All on the threshold, yet all short of life.



36. TWICE

	I took my heart in my hand
	(O my love O my love)
	I said: Let me fall or stand
	Let me live or die
	But this once hear me speak
	(O my love O my love);
	Yet a woman’s words are weak:
	You should speak not I.

	You took my heart in your hand
	With a friendly smile
	With a critical eye you scanned
	Then set it down
	And said: It is still unripe
	Better wait awhile;
	Wait while the skylarks pipe
	Till the corn grows brown.

	As you set it down it broke--
	Broke but I did not wince;
	I smiled at the speech you spoke
	At your judgment that I heard:
	But I have not often smiled
	Since then nor questioned since
	Nor cared for corn-flowers wild
	Nor sung with the singing bird.

	I take my heart in my hand
	O my God O my God
	My broken heart in my hand:
	Thou hast seen judge Thou.
	My hope was written on sand
	O my God O my God;
	Now let Thy judgment stand--
	Yea judge me now.

	This contemned of a man
	This marred one heedless day
	This heart take Thou to scan
	Both within and without:
	Refine with fire its gold
	Purge Thou its dross away--
	Yea hold it in Thy hold
	Whence none can pluck it out.

	I take my heart in my hand--
	I shall not die but live--
	Before Thy face I stand;
	I for Thou callest such:
	All that I have I bring
	All that I am I give
	Smile Thou and I shall sing
	But shall not question much.



37. UPHILL

	Does the road wind up-hill all the way?
	Yes, to the very end.
	Will the day’s journey take the whole long day?
	From morn to night, my friend.

	But is there for the night a resting-place?
	A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.
	May not the darkness hide it from my face?
	You cannot miss that inn.

	Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?
	Those who have gone before.
	Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?
	They will not keep you standing at that door.

	Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?
	Of labour you shall find the sum.
	Will there be beds for me and all who seek?
	Yea, beds for all who come.



38. WHEN I AM DEAD MY DEAREST

	When I am dead my dearest
	Sing no sad songs for me;
	Plant thou no roses at my head
	Nor shady cypress-tree:
	Be the green grass above me
	With showers and dewdrops wet;
	And if thou wilt remember
	And if thou wilt forget.

	I shall not see the shadows
	I shall not feel the rain;
	I shall not hear the nightingale
	Sing on as if in pain:
	And dreaming through the twilight
	That doth not rise nor set
	Haply I may remember
	And haply may forget.



39. WHO HAS SEEN THE WIND?

	Who has seen the wind?
	Neither I nor you:
	But when the leaves hang trembling,
	The wind is passing through.

	Who has seen the wind?
	Neither you nor I:
	But when the trees bow down their heads,
	The wind is passing by.
