*** Ford Madox Ford (1873 - 1939)


1. ANTWERP

	I
	
	GLOOM! 
	An October like November; 
	August a hundred thousand hours, 
	And all September, 
	A hundred thousand, dragging sunlit days, 
	And half October like a thousand years . . . 
	And doom! 
	That then was Antwerp . . . 
	                             In the name of God, 
	How could they do it? 
	Those souls that usually dived 
	Into the dirty caverns of mines; 
	Who usually hived 
	In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars; 
	Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud, 
	Lumbering to work over the greasy sods. . . 
	Those men there, with the appearance of clods 
	Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God 
	Ever shrived. . . 
	And it is not for us to make them an anthem. 
	If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them 
	To a tune that the trumpets might blow it, 
	Shrill through the heaven that’s ours or yet Allah’s, 
	Or the wide halls of any Valhallas. 
	We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours 
	For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays 
	Is this: 
	“In the name of God, how could they do it?” 
	
	
	II
	
	For there is no new thing under the sun, 
	Only this uncomely man with a smoking gun 
	In the gloom . . . 
	What the devil will he gain by it? 
	Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it 
	Waiting his doom; 
	The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, 
	Till the trench of gray mud 
	Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. 
	Well, there have been scars 
	Won in many wars . . .
	Punic, 
	Lacedæmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, 
	But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, 
	His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, 
	Overspreading his miserable land, 
	Standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . 
	Doom! 
	He finds that in a sudden scrimmage, 
	And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . 
	An image that shall take long to pass! 
	
	
	III
	
	For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses 
	Forever through our brains. 
	The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; 
	And battalions and battalions and battalions-- . . . 
	The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, 
	Pass, for ever staunch, 
	Stand, for ever true; 
	And the small man with the large paunch, 
	And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, 
	Watches them pass 
	In our minds for ever . . . 
	But that clutter of sodden corses 
	On the sodden Belgian grass-- 
	That is a strange new beauty. 
	
	
	IV
	
	With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, 
	Assuredly that is the way of it, 
	The way of beauty . . . 
	And that is the highest word you can find to say of it. 
	For you cannot praise it with words 
	Compounded of lyres and swords, 
	But the thought of the gloom and the rain 
	And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, 
	Shall eat itself into your brain: 
	And you will say of all heroes, “They fought like the Belgians!” 
	And you will say: “He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom.” 
	And you will say: “He bought like a Belgian his doom.” 
	And that shall be an honourable name; 
	“Belgian” shall be an honourable word; 
	As honourable as the fame of the sword, 
	As honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, 
	And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. 
	
	
	V
	
	And what in the world did they bear it for? 
	I don’t know. 
	And what in the world did they dare it for? 
	Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. 
	They could very well have watched a hundred legions go 
	Over their fields and between their cities 
	Down into more southerly regions. 
	They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, 
	And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. 
	I don’t understand. 
	Was it just love of their land? 
	Oh, poor dears! 
	Can any man so love his land? 
	Give them a thousand thousand pities 
	And rivers and rivers of tears 
	To wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. 
	
	
	VI
	
	This is Charing Cross; 
	It is midnight; 
	There is a great crowd 
	And no light. 
	A great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. 
	Surely, that is a dead woman--a dead mother! 
	She has a dead face; 
	She is dressed all in black; 
	She wanders to the bookstall and back, 
	At the back of the crowd; 
	And back again and again back, 
	She sways and wanders. 
	
	This is Charing Cross; 
	It is one o’clock. 
	There is still a great cloud, and very little light; 
	Immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd 
	That hardly whispers aloud. . . 
	And now! . . That is another dead mother, 
	And there is another and another and another . . . 
	And little children, all in black, 
	All with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, 
	Wandering from the doors of the waiting-room 
	In the dim gloom. 
	These are the women of Flanders.
	They await the lost. 
	They await the lost that shall never leave the dock; 
	They await the lost that shall never again come by the train 
	To the embraces of all these women with dead faces; 
	They await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, 
	In the dark of the night. 
	This is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; 
	There is very little light. 
	
	There is so much pain. 
	
	
	_L’Envoi_
	
	And it was for this that they endured this gloom; 
	This October like November, 
	That August like a hundred thousand hours, 
	And that September, 
	A hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, 
	And half October like a thousand years . . . 
	Oh, poor dears!


2. IN TENEBRIS

	All within is warm, 
	Here without it’s very cold, 
	Now the year is grown so old 
	And the dead leaves swarm. 
	
	In your heart is light, 
	Here without it’s very dark, 
	When shall I hear the lark? 
	When see aright? 
	
	Oh, for a moment’s space! 
	Draw the clinging curtains wide 
	Whilst I wait and yearn outside 
	Let the light fall on my face.


3. ON HEAVEN

	I
	
	That day the sunlight lay on the farms; 
	On the morrow the bitter frost that there was! 
	That night my young love lay in my arms, 
	The morrow how bitter it was! 
	
	And because she is very tall and quaint 
	And golden, like a quattrocento saint, 
	I desire to write about Heaven; 
	To tell you the shape and the ways of it, 
	And the joys and the toil in the maze of it, 
	For these there must be in Heaven, 
	Even in Heaven! 
	
	For God is a good man, God is a kind man, 
	And God’s a good brother, and God is no blind man, 
	And God is our father. 
	
	I will tell you how this thing began: 
	How I waited in a little town near Lyons for many years, 
	And yet knew nothing of passing time, or of her tears, 
	But, for nine slow years, lounged away at my table in the shadowy sunlit square 
	Where the small cafes are. 
	
	The Place is small and shaded by great planes, 
	Over a rather human monument 
	Set up to Louis Dixhuit in the year 
	Eighteen fourteen, a funnny thing with dolphins 
	About a pyramid of green-dripped, sordid stone. 
	But the enormous, monumental planes 
	Shade it all in, and in the flecks of sun 
	Sit market women. There’s a paper shop 
	Painted all blue, a shipping agency, 
	Three or four cafes; dank, dark colonnades 
	Of an eighteen-forty Mairie. i’d no wish 
	To wait for her where it was picturesque, 
	Or ancient or historic, or to love 
	Over well any place in the land before she came 
	And loved it too. I didn’t even go 
	To Lyons for the opera, Arles for the bulls, 
	Or Avignon for glimpses of the Rhone. 
	Not even to Beaucaire! I sat about 
	And played long games of dominoes with the maire, 
	Or passing commis-voyageurs. And so 
	I sat and watched the trains come in, and read 
	The Libre Parole and sipped the thin, fresh wine 
	They call Piquette, and got to know the people, 
	The kindly, southern people . . . 
	
	Until, when the years were over, she came in her swift red car, 
	Shooting out past a pram; and she slowed and stopped and lighted absently down, 
	A little dazed, in the heart of the town; 
	And nodded imperceptibly, 
	With a sideways look at me. 
	
	So our days here began. 
	
	And the wrinkled old woman who keeps the cafe, 
	And the man 
	Who sells the Libre Parole, 
	And the sleepy gendarme, 
	And the fat facteur who delivers letters only in the shady, 
	Pleasanter kind of streets; 
	And the boy I often gave a penny, 
	And the maire himself, and the little girl who loves toffee 
	And me because I have given her many sweets; 
	And the one-eyed droll 
	Bookseller of the rue Grand de Provence,-- 
	Chancing to be going home to bed, 
	Smiled with their kindly, fresh benevolence, 
	Because they knew I had waited for a lady 
	Who should come in a swift, red, English car, 
	To the square where the little cafes are. 
	And the old, old woman touched me on the wrist 
	With a wrinkled finger, 
	And said: ‘Why do you linger?-- 
	Too many kisses can never be kissed! 
	And comfort her--nobody here will think harm--
	Take her instantly to your arm! 
	it is a little strange, you know, to your dear, 
	To be dead! 
	
	But one is English, 
	Though one be never so much of a ghost; 
	And if most of your life has been spent in the craze to relinquish 
	What you want most, 
	You will go on relinquishing, 
	You will go on vanquishing 
	Human longings, even 
	in Heaven. 
	
	God! You will have forgotten what the rest of the world is on fire for--
	The madness of desire for the long and quiet embrace, 
	The coming nearer of a tear-wet face; 
	Forgotten the desire to slake 
	The thirst, and the long, slow ache, 
	And to interlace 
	Lash with lash, lip with lip, limb with limb, and the fingers of the hand 
	with the hand 
	And . . . 
	
	You will have forgotten . . . 
	But they will all awake; 
	Aye, all of them shall awaken 
	in this dear place. 
	And all that then we took 
	Of all that we might have taken, 
	Was that one embracing look, 
	Coursing over features, over limbs, between eyes, a making sure, and a 
	long sigh, 
	Having the tranquility 
	Of trees unshaken, 
	And the softness of sweet tears, 
	And the dearness of the dear brook 
	To wash away past years 
	(For that too is the quality of Heaven, 
	That you are conscious always of great pain 
	Only when it is over 
	And shall not come again. 
	Thank God, thank God, it shall not come again, 
	Though your eyes be never so wet with the tears 
	Of many years!) 
	
	
	II
	
	And so she stood a moment by the door 
	Of the long, red car. Royally she stepped down, 
	Settling one long foot and leaning back 
	Amongst her russet fires. And she looked round . . . 
	Of course it must be strange to come from England 
	Straight into Heaven. You must take it in, 
	Slowly, for a long instant, with some fear . . . 
	Now that affiche, in orange, on the kiosque: 
	‘Six Spanish bulls will fight on Sunday next 
	At Arles, in the arena’ . . . Well, it’s strange 
	Till you get used to our ways. And, on the Mairie, 
	The untidy poster telling of the concours 
	De vers de soie, of silkworms. The cocoons 
	Pile, yellow, all across the little Places 
	of ninety townships in the environs 
	Of Lyons, the city famous for her silks. 
	What if she’s pale? it must be more than strange, 
	After these years, to come out here from England 
	To a strange place, to the stretched-out arms of me, 
	A man never fully known, only divined, 
	Loved, guessed at, pledged to, in your Sussex mud, 
	Amongst the frost-bound farms by the yeasty sea. 
	Oh, the long look; the long, long searching look! 
	And how my heart beat! 
	Well, you see, in England 
	She had a husband. And four families--
	His, hers, mine, and another woman’s too--
	Would have gone crazy. And, with all the rest, 
	Eight parents, and the children, seven aunts 
	And sixteen uncles and a grandmother. 
	There were, besides, our names, a few real friends, 
	And the decencies of life. A monstrous heap! 
	They made a monstrous heap. i’ve lain awake 
	Whole aching nights to tot the figures up! 
	Heap after heaps, of complications, griefs, 
	Worries, tongue-clackings, nonsenses and shame 
	For not making good. You see the coil there was! 
	And the poor strained fibres of our tortured brains, 
	And the voice that called from depth in her to depth 
	in me . . . my God, in the dreadful nights, 
	Through the roar of the great black winds, through the sound of the sea! 
	Oh agony! Agony! From out my breast 
	it called whilst the dark house slept, and stairheads creaked; 
	From within my breast it screamed and made no sound; 
	And wailed . . . And made no sound. 
	And howled like the damned . . . No sound! No sound! 
	Only the roar of the wind, the sound of the sea, 
	The tick of the clock . . . 
	And our two voices, noiseless through the dark. 
	Oh God! Oh God! 
	
	(That night my young love lay in my arms . . . 
	
	There was a bitter frost lay on the farms 
	in England, by the shiver 
	And the crawling of the tide; 
	By the broken silver of the English Channel, 
	Beneath the aged moon that watched alone--
	Poor, dreary, lonely old moon to have to watch alone, 
	Over the dreary beaches mangled with ancient foam 
	Like shrunken flannel; 
	The moon, an intent, pale face, looking down 
	Over the English Channel. 
	
	But soft and warm She lay in the crook of my arm. 
	And came to no harm since we had come quietly home 
	Even to Heaven: 
	Which is situate in a little old town 
	Not very far from the side of the Rhone, 
	That mighty river 
	That is, just there by the Crau, in the lower reaches, 
	Far wider than the Channel.) 
	
	But, in the market place of the other little town, 
	Where the Rhone is a narrower, greener affair, 
	When she had looked at me, she beckoned with her long white hand, 
	A little languidly, since it is a strain, if a blessed strain, to have just 
	died, 
	And going back again, 
	into the long, red, English racing-car, 
	Made room for me amongst the furs at her side. 
	And we moved away from the kind looks of the kindly people 
	into the wine of the hurrying air. 
	And very soon even the tall grey steeple 
	of Lyons cathedral behind us grew little and far 
	And was no more there . . . 
	And, thank God, we had nothing any more to think of, 
	And, thank God, we had nothing any more to talk of, 
	Unless, as it chanced, the flashing silver stalk of the pampas 
	Growing down to the brink of the Rhone, 
	On the lawn of a little chateau, giving onto the river. 
	And we were alone, alone, alone . . . 
	At last alone . . . 
	
	The poplars on the hill-crests go marching rank on rank, 
	And far away to the left, like a pyramid, marches the ghost of Mont Blanc. 
	There are vines and vines and vines, all down to the river bank. 
	There will be a castle here, 
	And an abbey there; 
	And huge quarries and a long white farm, 
	With long thatched barns and a long wine shed, 
	As we ran alone, all down to the Rhone. 
	
	And that day there was no puncturing of the tyres to fear; 
	And no trouble at all with the engine and gear; 
	Smoothly and softly we ran between the great poplar alley 
	All down the valley of the Rhone. 
	For the dear, good God knew how we needed rest and to be alone. 
	But, on other days, just as you must have perfect shadows to make perfect 
	Rembrandts, 
	He shall affect us with little lets and hindrances of His own 
	Devising--just to let us be glad that we are dead . . . 
	Just for remembrance. 
	
	
	III
	
	Hard by the castle of God in the Alpilles, 
	in the eternal stone of Alpilles, 
	There’s this little old town, walled round by the old, grey gardens . . . 
	There were never such olives as grew in the gardens of God, 
	The green-grey trees, the wardens of agony 
	And failure of gods, 
	Of hatred and faith, of truth, of treachery 
	They whisper; they whisper that none of the living prevail; 
	They whirl in the great mistral over the white, dry sods, 
	Like hair blown back from white foreheads in the enormous gale 
	Up to the castle walls of God . . . 
	
	But in the town that’s our home, 
	Once you are past the wall, 
	Amongst the trunks of the planes, 
	Though they roar never so mightily overhead in the day, 
	All this tumult is quieted down, and all 
	The windows stand open because of the heat of the night 
	That shall come. 
	And, from each little window, shines in the twilight a light, 
	And, beneath t the eternal planes 
	With the huge, gnarled trunks that were aged and grey 
	At the creation of Time. 
	The Chinese lanthorns, hung out at the doors of hotels, 
	Shimmering in the dusk, here on an orange tree, there on a sweet-scented 
	lime, 
	There on a golden inscription: ‘Hotel of the Three Holy Bells, ’ 
	Or ‘Hotel Sublime, ’ or ‘inn of the Real Good Will’. 
	And yes, it is very warm and still, 
	And all the world is afoot after the heat of the day, 
	in the cool of the even in Heaven. 
	And it is here that I have brought my dear to pay h er all that I owed her, 
	Amidst thus crowd, with the soft voices, the soft footfalls, the rejoicing 
	laughter. 
	And after the twilight there falls such a warm, soft darkness, 
	And still there will come stealing under the planes a drowsy odour, 
	Compounded of all cyclamen, of oranges, or rosemary and bay, 
	To take the remembrance of the toil of the day away. 
	
	So we sat at a little table, under an immense plane, 
	And we remembered again 
	The blisters and foments 
	And terrible harassments of the tired brain, 
	The cold and the frost and the pain, 
	As if we were looking at a picture and saying: ‘This is true! 
	Why this is a truly painted 
	Rendering of that street where--you remember?--I fainted.’ 
	And we remembered again 
	Tranquilly, our poor few tranquil moments, 
	The falling of the sunlight through the panes, 
	The flutter for ever in the chimney of the quiet flame, 
	The mutter of our two poor tortured voices, always a-whisper. 
	And the endless nights when I would cry out, running through all 
	the gamut of misery, even to a lisp, her name; 
	And we remembered our kisses, nine, maybe, or eleven--
	if you count two that I gave and she did not give again. 
	
	And always the crowd drifted by in the cool of the even, 
	And we saw the faces of friends, 
	And the faces of those to who one day we must make amends, 
	Smiling in welcome. 
	And I said: ‘On another day--
	And such a day may well come soon--
	We will play dominoes with Dick and Evelyn and Frances 
	For a while afternoon. 
	And, in the time to come, Genee 
	Shall dance for us, fluttering over the ground as the sunlight dances.’ 
	And Arlesiennes with the beautiful faces went by us, 
	And gipsies and Spanish shepherds, noiseless in sandals of straw, sauntered 
	night us, 
	Wearing slouch hats and old sheep-skins, and casting admiring glances 
	From dark, foreign eyes at my dear . . . 
	(And ah, it is Heaven alone, to have her alone and so near!) 
	So all this world rejoices 
	in the cool of the even 
	in Heaven . . . 
	And, when the cool of the even was fully there, 
	Came a great ha-ha of voices. 
	Many children run together, and all laugh and rejoice and call, 
	Hurrying with little arms flying, and little feet flying, and little 
	hurrying haunches, 
	From the door of a stable, 
	Where, in an olla podrida, they had been playing at the corrida 
	With the black Spanish bull, whose nature 
	is patience with children. And so, through the gaps of the branches 
	Of Jasmine on our screen beneath the planes, 
	We saw, coming down from the road that leads to the olives and Alpilles, 
	A man of great stature, 
	in a great cloak, 
	With a great stride, 
	And a little joke 
	For all and sundry, coming down with a hound at his side. 
	And he stood at the cross-roads, passing the time of day 
	in a great, kind voice, the voice of a man-and-a-half!--
	With a great laugh, and a great clap on the back, 
	For a fellow in black--a priest I should say, 
	Or may be a lover, 
	Wearing black for his mistress’s mood. 
	‘A little toothache, ’ we could hear him say; ‘but that’s so good 
	When it gives over.’ So he passed from sight 
	in the soft twilight, into the soft night, 
	in the soft riot and tumult of the crowd. 
	
	And a magpie flew down, laughing, holding up his beak to us, 
	And I said: ‘That was God! Presently, when he has walked through the town 
	And the night has settled down, 
	So that you may not be afraid, 
	in the darkness, he will come to our table and speak to us.’ 
	And past us many saints went walking in a company--
	The kindly, thoughtful saints, devising and laughing and talking, 
	And smiling at us with their pleasant solicitude. 
	And because the thick of the crowd followed to the one side God, 
	Or to the other the saints, we sat in solitude 
	in the distance the saints went singing all in chorus, 
	And our Lord went on the other side of the street, 
	Holding a little boy. 
	Taking him to pick the musk-roses that open at dusk, 
	For wreathing the statue of Jove, 
	Left on the Alpilles above 
	By the Romans; since Jove, 
	Even Jove, 
	Must not want for his quota of honour and love; 
	But round about him there must be, 
	With all its tender jollity, 
	The laughter of children in Heaven, 
	Making merry with roses in Heaven. 
	
	Yet never he looked at us, knowing that that would be such joy 
	As must be over-great for hearts that needed quiet; 
	Such a riot and tumult of joy as quiet hearts are not able 
	To taste to the full . . . 
	
	. . . And my dear one sat in the shadows; very softly she wept:--
	Such joy is in Heaven, 
	in the cool of the even, 
	After the burden and toil of the days, 
	After the heat and haze 
	in the vine-hills; or in the shady 
	Whispering groves in high passes up in the Alpilles, 
	Guarding the castle of God. 
	
	And I went on talking towards her unseen face: 
	‘So it is, so it goes, in this beloved place, 
	There shall be never a grief but passes; no, not any; 
	There shall be such bright light and no blindness; 
	There shall be so little awe and so much loving-kindness; 
	There shall be a little longing and enough care, 
	There shall be a little labor and enough of toil 
	To bring back the lost flavour of our human coil; 
	Not enough to taint it; 
	And all that we desire shall prove as fair as we can paint it.’ 
	For, though that may be the very hardest trick of all 
	God set Himself, who fashioned this goodly hall. 
	Thus has He made Heaven; 
	Even Heaven. 
	
	For God is a very clever mechanician; 
	And if He made this proud and goodly ship of the world, 
	From the maintop to the hull, 
	Do you think He could not finish it to the full, 
	With a flag and all, 
	And make it sail, tall and brave, 
	On the waters, beyond the grave? 
	it should cost but very little rhetoric 
	To explain for you that last, fine, conjuring trick; 
	To give to each man after his heart 
	Who knows very well what each man has in his heart: 
	To let you pass your life in a night-club where they dance, 
	if that is your idea of heaven; if you will, in the South of France; 
	if you will, on the turbulent sea; if you will, in the peace of the night; 
	Where you will; how you will; 
	Or in the long death of a kiss, that may never pall; 
	He would be a very little God if He could not do all this, 
	And He is still 
	The great God of all. 
	
	For God is a good man; God is a kind man; 
	in the darkness He came walking to our table beneath the planes, And spoke 
	So kindly to my dear, 
	With a little joke, 
	Giving himself some pains 
	To take away her fear 
	Of His stature, 
	So as not to abash her, 
	in no way at all to dash her new pleasure beneath the planes, 
	in the cool of the even 
	in Heaven. 
	
	That, that is God’s nature, 
	For God’s a good brother, and God is no blind man, 
	And God’s a good mother and loves sons who’re rovers, 
	And God is our father and loves all good lovers. 
	He has a kindly smile for many a poor sinner; 
	He takes note to make it up to poor wayfarers on sodden roads; 
	Such as bear heavy loads 
	He takes note of, and of all that toil on bitter seas and frosty lands, 
	He takes care that they shall have good at His hands; 
	Well He takes note of a poor old cook, 
	Cooking your dinner; 
	And much He loves sweet joys in such as ever took 
	Sweet joy on earth. He has a kindly smile for a kiss 
	Given in a shady nook. 
	And in the golden book 
	Where the accounts of His estate are kept, 
	All the round, golden sovereigns of bliss, 
	Known by poor lovers, married or never yet married, 
	While the green world waked, or the black world quietly slept; 
	All joy, all sweetness, each sweet sight that’s sighed-- 
	Their accounts are kept, 
	And carried 
	By the love of God to His own credit’s side. 
	So that is why He came to our table to welcome my dear, dear bride, 
	in the cool of the even 
	in front of a cafe in Heaven.


4. THAT EXPLOIT OF YOURS

	I meet with two soldiers sometimes here in Hell 
	The one, with a tear on the seat of hi red pantaloons 
	Was stuck by a pitchfork, 
	Climbing a wall to steal apples. 
	
	The second has a seeming silver helmet, 
	Having died from a fall from his horse on some tram-lines 
	In Dortmund. 
	
	These two 
	Meeting in the vaulted and vaporous caverns of Hell 
	Exclaim always in identical tones: 
	‘I at least have done my duty to Society and the Fatherland!’ 
	It is strange how the cliché` prevails . . .
	For I will bet my hat that you sent me here to Hell 
	Are saying the selfsame words at this very moment 
	Concerning that exploit of yours.


5. THERE SHALL BE MORE JOY

	The little angels of Heaven 
	Each wear a long white dress, 
	And in the tall arcadings 
	Play ball and play at chess; 
	
	With never a soil on their garments, 
	Not a sigh the whole day long, 
	Not a bitter note in their pleasure, 
	Not a bitter note in their song. 
	
	But they shall know keener pleasure, 
	And they shall know joy more rare--
	Keener, keener pleasure 
	When you, my dear, come there. 
	
	The little angels of Heaven 
	Each wear a long white gown, 
	And they lean over the ramparts 
	Waiting and looking down.


6. WHAT THE ORDERLY DOG SAW

	I
	
	   The seven white peacocks against the castle wall
	In the high trees and the dusk are like tapestry;
	The sky being orange, the high wall a purple barrier,
	The canal dead silver in the dusk:
	And you are far away.
	
	Yet I see infinite miles of mountains,
	Little lights shining in rows in the dark of them--
	Infinite miles of marshes;
	Thin wisps of mist, shimmering like blue webs
	Over the dusk of them.
	
	Great curves and horns of sea,
	And dusk and dusk, and the little village;
			And you, sitting in the firelight.
	
	
	II
	
	   Around me are the two hundred and forty men of B Com-
		pany,
	Mud-colored;
	Going about their avocations,
	Resting between their practice of the art
	Of killing men;
	As I too rest between my practice
	Of the art of killing men.
	Their pipes glow over the mud and their mud-color, moving
		like fireflies beneath the trees--
	I too being mud-colored--
	Beneath the trees and the peacocks.
	When they come up to me in the dusk
	They start, stiffen and salute, almost invisibly.
	And the forty-two prisoners from the battalion guard-room
	Crouch over the tea-cans in the shadow of the wall.
	And the bread hunks glimmer, beneath the peacocks--
			And you are far away.
	
	
	III
	
	   Presently I shall go in
	I shall write down the names of the forty-two
	Prisoners in the battalion guard-room
	On fair white foolscap:
	Their names, rank and regimental numbers;
	Corps, Companies, Punishments and Offences,
	Remarks, and By whom confined.
	Yet in spite of all I shall see only
	The infinite miles of dark mountain,
	The infinite miles of dark marshland,
	Great curves and horns of sea;
	The little village;
	And you,
	Sitting in the firelight.
