*** Khalil Gibran (1883 - 1931)


1. AND WHEN MY SORROW WAS BORN

	And when my Joy was born, I held it in my arms and stood on the
	house-top shouting, “Come ye, my neighbours, come and see, for Joy
	this day is born unto me.  Come and behold this gladsome thing that
	laugheth in the sun.”
	
	But none of my neighbours came to look upon my Joy, and great was
	my astonishment.
	
	And every day for seven moons I proclaimed my Joy from the
	house-top--and yet no one heeded me.  And my Joy and I were alone,
	unsought and unvisited.
	
	Then my Joy grew pale and weary because no other heart but mine
	held its loveliness and no other lips kissed its lips.
	
	Then my Joy died of isolation.
	
	And now I only remember my dead Joy in remembering my dead Sorrow.
	But memory is an autumn leaf that murmurs a while in the wind and
	then is heard no more.


2. DEFEAT

	Defeat, my Defeat, my solitude and my aloofness;
	You are dearer to me than a thousand triumphs,
	And sweeter to my heart than all world-glory.
	
	Defeat, my Defeat, my self-knowledge and my defiance,
	Through you I know that I am yet young and swift of foot
	And not to be trapped by withering laurels.
	And in you I have found aloneness
	And the joy of being shunned and scorned.
	
	Defeat, my Defeat, my shining sword and shield,
	In your eyes I have read
	That to be enthroned is to be enslaved,
	And to be understood is to be leveled down,
	And to be grasped is but to reach one’s fullness
	And like a ripe fruit to fall and be consumed.
	
	Defeat, my Defeat, my bold companion,
	You shall hear my songs and my cries and my silences,
	And none but you shall speak to me of the beating of wings,
	And urging of seas,
	And of mountains that burn in the night,
	And you alone shall climb my steep and rocky soul.
	
	Defeat, my Defeat, my deathless courage,
	You and I shall laugh together with the storm,
	And together we shall dig graves for all that die in us,
	And we shall stand in the sun with a will,
	And we shall be dangerous.


3. DO NOT LOVE HALF LOVERS

	Do not love half lovers
	Do not entertain half friends
	Do not indulge in works of the half talented
	Do not live half a life and do not die a half death
	If you choose silence, then be silent
	When you speak, do so until you are finished
	Do not silence yourself to say something
	And do not speak to be silent
	If you accept, then express it bluntly
	Do not mask it
	If you refuse then be clear about it
	for an ambiguous refusal
	is but a weak acceptance
	Do not accept half a solution
	Do not believe half truths
	Do not dream half a dream
	Do not fantasize about half hopes
	Half a drink will not quench your thirst
	Half a meal will not satiate your hunger
	Half the way will get you no where
	Half an idea will bear you no results
	Your other half is not the one you love
	It is you in another time yet in the same space
	It is you when you are not
	Half a life is a life you didn’t live,
	A word you have not said
	A smile you postponed
	A love you have not had
	A friendship you did not know
	To reach and not arrive
	Work and not work
	Attend only to be absent
	What makes you a stranger to them closest to you
	and they strangers to you
	The half is a mere moment of inability
	but you are able for you are not half a being
	You are a whole that exists
	to live a life not half a life


4. GOD

	In the ancient days, when the first quiver of speech came to my lips,
	I ascended the holy mountain and spoke unto God, saying, “Master,
	I am thy slave.  Thy hidden will is my law and I shall obey thee
	for ever more.”
	
	But God made no answer, and like a mighty tempest passed away.
	
	And after a thousand years I ascended the holy mountain and again
	spoke unto God, saying, “Creator, I am thy creation.  Out of clay
	hast thou fashioned me and to thee I owe mine all.”
	
	And God made no answer, but like a thousand swift wings passed
	away.
	
	And after a thousand years I climbed the holy mountain and spoke
	unto God again, saying, “Father, I am thy son.  In pity and love
	thou hast given me birth, and through love and worship I shall
	inherit thy kingdom.”
	
	And God made no answer, and like the mist that veils the distant
	hills he passed away.
	
	And after a thousand years I climbed the sacred mountain and again
	spoke unto God, saying, “My God, my aim and my fulfillment; I am
	thy yesterday and thou are my tomorrow.  I am thy root in the earth
	and thou art my flower in the sky, and together we grow before the
	face of the sun.”
	
	Then God leaned over me, and in my ears whispered words of sweetness,
	and even as the sea that enfoldeth a brook that runneth down to
	her, he enfolded me.
	
	And when I descended to the valleys and the plains God was there
	also.


5. THE GREAT LONGING

	Here I sit between my brother the mountain and my sister the sea.
	
	We three are one in loneliness, and the love that binds us together
	is deep and strong and strange.  Nay, it is deeper than my sister’s
	depth and stronger than my brother’s strength, and stranger than
	the strangeness of my madness.
	
	Aeons upon aeons have passed since the first grey dawn made us
	visible to one another; and though we have seen the birth and the
	fullness and the death of many worlds, we are still eager and young.
	
	We are young and eager and yet we are mateless and unvisited, and
	though we lie in unbroken half embrace, we are uncomforted.  And
	what comfort is there for controlled desire and unspent passion?
	Whence shall come the flaming god to warm my sister’s bed?  And
	what she-torrent shall quench my brother’s fire?  And who is the
	woman that shall command my heart?
	
	In the stillness of the night my sister murmurs in her sleep the
	fire-god’s unknown name, and my brother calls afar upon the cool
	and distant goddess.  But upon whom I call in my sleep I know not.
	
	Here I sit between my brother the mountain and my sister the sea.
	We three are one in loneliness, and the love that binds us together
	is deep and strong and strange.


6. ON BEAUTY

	And a poet said, Speak to us of Beauty.
	    And he answered:
	    Where shall you seek beauty, and how
	shall you find her unless she herself be your
	way and your guide?
	    And how shall you speak of her except
	she be the weaver of your speech?
	
	    The aggrieved and the injured say,
	“Beauty is kind and gentle.
	    Like a young mother half-shy of her
	own glory she walks among us.”
	    And the passionate say, “Nay, beauty is
	a thing of might and dread.
	    Like the tempest she shakes the earth
	beneath us and the sky above us.”
	
	    The tired and the weary say, “Beauty is
	of soft whisperings. She speaks in our spirit.
	    Her voice yields to our silences like a faint
	light that quivers in fear of the shadow.”
	    But the restless say, “We have heard her
	shouting among the mountains,
	    And with her cries came the sound of
	hoofs, and the beating of wings and
	the roaring of lions.”
	
	    At night the watchmen of the city say,
	“Beauty shall rise with the dawn from the
	east.”
	    And at noontide the toilers and the way-
	farers say, “We have seen her leaning over
	the earth from the windows of the sunset.”
	
	    In winter say the snow-bound, “She shall
	come with the spring leaping upon the hills.”
	    And in the summer heat the reapers say,
	“We have seen her dancing with the autumn
	leaves, and we saw a drift of snow in her
	hair.”
	    All these things have you said of beauty,
	    Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of
	needs unsatisfied,
	    And beauty is not a need but an ecstasy.
	    It is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty
	hand stretched forth,
	    But rather a heart enflamed and a soul en-
	chanted.
	    It is not the image you would see nor the
	song you would hear,
	    But rather an image you see though you
	close your eyes and a song you hear though
	you shut your ears.
	    It is not the sap within the furrowed bark,
	nor a wing attached to a claw,
	    But rather a garden for ever in bloom and
	a flock of angels for ever in flight.
	
	    People of Orphalese, beauty is life when
	life unveils her holy face.
	    But you are life and you are the veil.
	    Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror.
	    But you are eternity and you are the mirror.


7. ON FREEDOM

	And an orator said, Speak to us of Freedom.
	   And he answered:
	   At the city gate and by your fireside I
	have seen you prostrate yourself and worship
	your own freedom,
	   Even as slaves humble themselves before
	a tyrant and praise him though he slays
	them.
	   Ay, in the grove of the temple and in
	the shadow of the citadel I have seen the
	freest among you wear their freedom as a
	yoke and a handcuff.
	   And my heart bled within me; for you
	can only be free when even the desire of
	seeking freedom becomes a harness to you,
	and when you cease to speak of freedom
	as a goal and a fulfilment.
	
	   You shall be free indeed when your days
	are not without a care nor your nights without 
	a want and a grief,
	   But rather when these things girdle your
	life and yet you rise above them naked and
	unbound.
	
	   And how shall you rise beyond your
	days and nights unless you break the chains
	which you at the dawn of your understanding 
	have fastened around your noon
	hour?
	   In truth that which you call freedom is
	the strongest of these chains, though its
	links glitter in the sun and dazzle your eyes.
	
	   And what is it but fragments of your own
	self you would discard that you may become
	free?
	   If it is an unjust law you would abolish,
	that law was written with your own hand
	upon your own forehead.
	   You cannot erase it by burning your law
	books nor by washing the foreheads of your
	judges, though you pour the sea upon them.
	   And if it is a despot you would dethrone,
	see first that his throne erected within you is
	destroyed.
	   For how can a tyrant rule the free and
	the proud, but for a tyranny in their own
	freedom and a shame in their own pride?
	   And if it is a care you would cast off, that
	care has been chosen by you rather than
	imposed upon you.
	   And if it is a fear you would dispel, the
	seat of that fear is in your heart and not in
	the hand of the feared.
	
	   Verily all things move within your being
	in constant half embrace, the desired and
	the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished,
	the pursued and that which you would
	escape.
	   These things move within you as lights
	and shadows in pairs that cling.
	   And when the shadow fades and is no
	more, the light that lingers becomes a
	shadow to another light.
	   And thus your freedom when it loses its
	fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater
	freedom.


8. ON LAWS

	Then a lawyer said, But what of our Laws,
	master?
	   And he answered:
	   You delight in laying down laws,
	   Yet you delight more in breaking them.
	   Like children playing by the ocean who
	build sand-towers with constancy and then
	destroy them with laughter.
	   But while you build your sand-towers the
	ocean brings more sand to the shore,
	   And when you destroy them the ocean
	laughs with you.
	   Verily the ocean laughs always with the
	innocent.
	
	   But what of those to whom life is not an
	ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-towers,
	   But to whom life is a rock, and the law
	a chisel with which they would carve it in
	their own likeness?
	   What of the cripple who hates dancers?
	   What of the ox who loves his yoke and
	deems the elk and deer of the forest
	stray and vagrant things?
	   What of the old serpent who cannot
	shed his skin, and calls all others naked
	and shameless?
	   And of him who comes early to the
	wedding-feast, and when over-fed and tired
	goes his way saying that all feasts are
	violation and all feasters lawbreakers?
	
	   What shall I say of these save that they
	too stand in the sunlight, but with their
	backs to the sun?
	   They see only their shadows, and their
	shadows are their laws.
	   And what is the sun to them but a caster
	of shadows?
	   And what is it to acknowledge the laws
	but to stoop down and trace their shadows
	upon the earth?
	   But you who walk facing the sun, what
	images drawn on the earth can hold you?
	   You who travel with the wind, what
	weather-vane shall direct your course?
	   What man’s law shall bind you if you
	break your yoke but upon no man’s prison
	door?
	   What laws shall you fear if you dance
	but stumble against no man’s iron chains?
	   And who is he that shall bring you to
	judgment if you tear off your garment yet
	leave it in no man’s path?
	
	   People of Orphalese, you can muffle the
	drum, and you can loosen the strings of the
	lyre, but who shall command the skylark
	not to sing?


9. ON LOVE

	Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.
	    And he raised his head and looked upon
	the people, and there fell a stillness upon
	them. And with a great voice he said:
	    When love beckons to you, follow him,
	    Though his ways are hard and steep.
	    And when his wings enfold you yield to
	him,
	    Though the sword hidden among his
	pinions may wound you.
	    And when he speaks to you believe in
	him,
	    Though his voice may shatter your dreams
	as the north wind lays waste the garden.
	
	    For even as love crowns you so shall he
	crucify you. Even as he is for your growth
	so is he for your pruning.
	    Even as he ascends to your height and
	caresses your tenderest branches that quiver
	in the sun,
	    So shall he descend to your roots and
	shake them in their clinging to the earth.
	                                      
	    Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto
	himself.
	    He threshes you to make you naked.
	    He sifts you to free you from your husks.
	    He grinds you to whiteness.
	    He kneads you until you are pliant;
	    And then he assigns you to his sacred
	fire, that you may become sacred bread for
	God’s sacred feast.
	
	    All these things shall love do unto you
	that you may know the secrets of your
	heart, and in that knowledge become a
	fragment of Life’s heart.
	
	    But if in your fear you would seek only
	love’s peace and love’s pleasure,
	    Then it is better for you that you cover
	your nakedness and pass out of love’s
	threshing-floor,
	    Into the seasonless world where you
	shall laugh, but not all of your laughter,
	and weep, but not all of your tears.
	                                     
	    Love gives naught but itself and takes
	naught but from itself.
	    Love possesses not nor would it be
	possessed;
	    For love is sufficient unto love.
	
	    When you love you should not say,
	“God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am
	in the heart of God.”
	    And think not you can direct the course
	of love, for love, if it finds you worthy,
	directs your course.
	
	    Love has no other desire but to fulfil
	itself.
	    But if you love and must needs have
	desires, let these be your desires:
	    To melt and be like a running brook
	that sings its melody to the night.
	    To know the pain of too much tenderness.
	    To be wounded by your own under-
	standing of love;
	    And to bleed willingly and joyfully.
	    To wake at dawn with a winged heart
	and give thanks for another day of loving;
	    To rest at the noon hour and meditate
	love’s ecstasy;
	    To return home at eventide with grati-
	tude;
	    And then to sleep with a prayer for the
	beloved in your heart and a song of praise
	upon your lips.


10. ON PLEASURE

	Then a hermit, who visited the city once
	a year, came forth and said, Speak to us of
	Pleasure.
	   And he answered, saying:
	   Pleasure is a freedom-song,
	   But it is not freedom.
	   It is the blossoming of your desires,
	   But it is not their fruit.
	   It is a depth calling unto a height,
	   But it is not the deep nor the high.
	   It is the caged taking wing,
	   But it is not space encompassed.
	   Ay, in very truth, pleasure is a freedom-song.
	   And I fain would have you sing it with
	fullness of heart; yet I would not have you
	lose your hearts in the singing.
	
	   Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it
	were all, and they are judged and rebuked.
	   I would not judge nor rebuke them. I
	would have them seek.
	   For they shall find pleasure, but not her
	alone;
	   Seven are her sisters, and the least of them
	is more beautiful than pleasure.
	   Have you not heard of the man who was
	digging in the earth for roots and found a
	treasure?
	
	   And some of your elders remember
	pleasures with regret like wrongs committed in drunkenness.
	   But regret is the beclouding of the mind
	and not its chastisement.
	   They should remember their pleasures with
	gratitude, as they would the harvest of a
	summer.
	   Yet if it comforts them to regret, let them
	be comforted.
	
	   And there are among you those who are
	neither young to seek nor old to remember;
	   And in their fear of seeking and remembering 
	they shun all pleasures, lest they
	neglect the spirit or offend against it.
	   But even in their foregoing is their
	pleasure.
	   And thus they too find a treasure though
	they dig for roots with quivering hands.
	   But tell me, who is he that can offend the
	spirit?
	   Shall the nightingale offend the stillness of
	the night, or the firefly the stars?
	   And shall your flame or your smoke
	burden the wind?
	   Think you the spirit is a still pool which
	you can trouble with a staff?
	
	   Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure
	you do but store the desire in the recesses
	of your being.
	   Who knows but that which seems omitted
	today, waits for tomorrow?
	   Even your body knows its heritage and
	its rightful need and will not be deceived.
	   And your body is the harp of your soul,
	   And it is yours to bring forth sweet
	music from it or confused sounds.
	
	    And now you ask in your heart, “How
	shall we distinguish that which is good in
	pleasure from that which is not good?”
	    Go to your fields and your gardens, and
	you shall learn that it is the pleasure of
	the bee to gather honey of the flower,
	    But it is also the pleasure of the flower
	to yield its honey to the bee.
	    For to the bee a flower is a fountain of
	life,
	    And to the flower a bee is a messenger of
	love,
	    And to both, bee and flower, the giving
	and the receiving of pleasure is a need and
	an ecstasy.
	
	    People of Orphalese, be in your pleasures 
	like the flowers and the bees.


11. ON TEACHING

	Then said a teacher, Speak to us of Teaching.
	   And he said:
	   No man can reveal to you aught but that
	which already lies half asleep in the dawning 
	of your knowledge.
	   The teacher who walks in the shadow of
	the temple, among his followers, gives not
	of his wisdom but rather of his faith and
	his lovingness.
	   If he is indeed wise he does not bid you
	enter the house of his wisdom, but rather
	leads you to the threshold of your own
	mind.
	  The astronomer may speak to you of his
	understanding of space, but he cannot give
	you his understanding.
	  The musician may sing to you of the
	rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot
	give you the ear which arrests the rhythm
	nor the voice that echoes it.
	  And he who is versed in the science of
	numbers can tell of the regions of weight
	and measure, but he cannot conduct you
	thither.
	  For the vision of one man lends not its
	wings to another man.
	  And even as each one of you stands alone
	in God’s knowledge, so must each one of
	you be alone in his knowledge of God and
	in his understanding of the earth.


12. THE POMEGRANATE

	Once when I was living in the heart of a pomegranate, I heard a seed
	saying, “Someday I shall become a tree, and the wind will sing in
	my branches, and the sun will dance on my leaves, and I shall be
	strong and beautiful through all the seasons.”
	
	Then another seed spoke and said, “When I was as young as you, I
	too held such views; but now that I can weigh and measure things,
	I see that my hopes were vain.”
	
	And a third seed spoke also, “I see in us nothing that promises so
	great a future.”
	
	And a fourth said, “But what a mockery our life would be, without
	a greater future!”
	
	Said a fifth, “Why dispute what we shall be, when we know not even
	what we are.”
	
	But a sixth replied, “Whatever we are, that we shall continue to
	be.”
	
	And a seventh said, “I have such a clear idea how everything will
	be, but I cannot put it into words.”
	
	Then an eight spoke--and a ninth--and a tenth--and then many--until
	all were speaking, and I could distinguish nothing for the many
	voices.
	
	And so I moved that very day into the heart of a quince, where the
	seeds are few and almost silent.
