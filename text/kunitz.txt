*** Stanley Kunitz (1905 - 2006)


1. FATHER AND SON

	Now in the suburbs and the falling light
	I followed him, and now down sandy road
	Whitter than bone-dust, through the sweet
	Curdle of fields, where the plums
	Dropped with their load of ripeness, one by one.
	Mile after mile I followed, with skimming feet,
	After the secret master of my blood,
	Him, steeped in the odor of ponds, whose indomitable love
	Kept me in chains. Strode years; stretched into bird;
	Raced through the sleeping country where I was young,
	The silence unrolling before me as I came,
	The night nailed like an orange to my brow.
	
	How should I tell him my fable and the fears,
	How bridge the chasm in a casual tone,
	Saying, “The house, the stucco one you built,
	We lost. Sister married and went from home,
	And nothing comes back, it’s strange, from where she goes.
	I lived on a hill that had too many rooms;
	Light we could make, but not enough of warmth,
	And when the light failed, I climbed under the hill.
	The papers are delivered every day;
	I am alone and never shed a tear.”
	
	At the water’s edge, where the smothering ferns lifted
	Their arms, “Father!“ I cried, “Return! You know
	The way. I’ll wipe the mudstains from your clothes;
	No trace, I promise, will remain. Instruct
	You son, whirling between two wars,
	In the Gemara of your gentleness,
	For I would be a child to those who mourn
	And brother to the foundlings of the field
	And friend of innocence and all bright eyes.
	0 teach me how to work and keep me kind.”
	
	Among the turtles and the lilies he turned to me
	The white ignorant hollow of his face.


2. KING OF THE RIVER

	If the water were clear enough,
	if the water were still,
	but the water is not clear,
	the water is not still,
	you would see yourself,
	slipped out of your skin,
	nosing upstream,
	slapping, thrashing,
	tumbling
	over the rocks
	till you paint them
	with your belly’s blood:
	Finned Ego,
	yard of muscle that coils,
	uncoils.
	If the knowledge were given you,
	but it is not given,
	for the membrane is clouded
	with self-deceptions
	and the iridescent image swims
	through a mirror that flows,
	you would surprise yourself
	in that other flesh
	heavy with milt,
	bruised, battering toward the dam
	that lips the orgiastic pool.
	
	Come. Bathe in these waters.
	Increase and die.
	
	If the power were granted you
	to break out of your cells,
	but the imagination fails
	and the doors of the senses close
	on the child within,
	you would dare to be changed,
	as you are changing now,
	into the shape you dread
	beyond the merely human.
	A dry fire eats you.
	Fat drips from your bones.
	The flutes of your gills discolor.
	You have become a ship for parasites.
	The great clock of your life
	is slowing down,
	and the small clocks run wild.
	For this you were born.
	You have cried to the wind
	and heard the wind’s reply:
	“I did not choose the way,
	the way chose me.”
	You have tasted the fire on your tongue
	till it is swollen black
	with a prophetic joy:
	“Burn with me!
	The only music is time,
	the only dance is love.”
	
	If the heart were pure enough,
	but it is not pure,
	you would admit
	that nothing compels you
	any more, nothing
	at all abides,
	but nostalgia and desire,
	the two-way ladder
	between heaven and hell.
	On the threshold
	of the last mystery,
	at the brute absolute hour,
	you have looked into the eyes
	of your creature self,
	which are glazed with madness,
	and you say
	he is not broken but endures,
	limber and firm
	in the state of his shining,
	forever inheriting his salt kingdom,
	from which he is banished
	forever.


3. THE LAYERS

	I have walked through many lives,
	some of them my own,
	and I am not who I was,
	though some principle of being
	abides, from which I struggle
	not to stray.
	When I look behind,
	as I am compelled to look
	before I can gather strength
	to proceed on my journey,
	I see the milestones dwindling
	toward the horizon
	and the slow fires trailing
	from the abandoned camp-sites,
	over which scavenger angels
	wheel on heavy wings.
	Oh, I have made myself a tribe
	out of my true affections,
	and my tribe is scattered!
	How shall the heart be reconciled
	to its feast of losses?
	In a rising wind
	the manic dust of my friends,
	those who fell along the way,
	bitterly stings my face.
	Yet I turn, I turn,
	exulting somewhat,
	with my will intact to go
	wherever I need to go,
	and every stone on the road
	precious to me.
	In my darkest night,
	when the moon was covered
	and I roamed through wreckage,
	a nimbus-clouded voice
	directed me:
	“Live in the layers,
	not on the litter.”
	Though I lack the art
	to decipher it,
	no doubt the next chapter
	in my book of transformations
	is already written.
	I am not done with my changes.


4. MASTER AND MISTRESS

	As if I were composed of dust and air,
	The shape confronting me upon the stair
	(Athlete of shadow, lighted by a stain
	On its disjunctive breast--I saw it plain--)
	Moved through my middle flesh. I turned around,
	Shaken and it was marching without sound
	Beyond the door; and when my hand was taken
	
	From my mouth to beat the standing heart, I cried
	My distant name, thinking myself had died.
	One moment I was entered; one moment then
	I knew a total century of pain
	Between the twinkling of two thoughts. The ghost
	Knocked on my ribs, demanding, “Host! Host!
	I am diseased with motion. Give me bread
	Before I quickly go. Shall I be fed?”
	Yielding, I begged of him: “Partake of me.
	Whatever runneth from the artery,
	This body and its unfamiliar wine,
	Stored in whatever dark of love, are thine.”
	But he denied me, saying, “Every part
	of thee is given, yea, thy flesh, thy heart.”


5. PASSING THROUGH

	Nobody in the widow’s household
	ever celebrated anniversaries.
	In the secrecy of my room
	I would not admit I cared
	that my friends were given parties.
	Before I left town for school
	my birthday went up in smoke
	in a fire at City Hall that gutted
	the Department of Vital Statistics.
	If it weren’t for a census report
	of a five-year-old White Male
	sharing my mother’s address
	at the Green Street tenement in Worcester
	I’d have no documentary proof
	that I exist. You are the first,
	my dear, to bully me
	into these festive occasions.
	
	Sometimes, you say, I wear
	an abstracted look that drives you
	up the wall, as though it signified
	distress or disaffection.
	Don’t take it so to heart.
	Maybe I enjoy not-being as much
	as being who I am. Maybe
	it’s time for me to practice
	growing old. The way I look
	at it, I’m passing through a phase:
	gradually I’m changing to a word.
	Whatever you choose to claim
	of me is always yours:
	nothing is truly mine
	except my name. I only
	borrowed this dust.


6. RIVER ROAD

	That year of the cloud, when my marriage failed,
	I slept in a chair, by the flagstone hearth,
	fighting my sleep,
	and one night saw a Hessian soldier
	stand at attention there in full
	regalia, till his head broke into flames.
	My only other callers were the FBI
	sent to investigate me as a Russian spy
	by patriotic neighbors on the river road;
	and flying squirrels parachuting from the elms
	who squeaked in rodent heat between the walls
	and upstairs rumbled at their nutty games.
	I never dared open the attic door.
	Even my nervous Leghorns joined the act,
	indulging their taste for chicken from behind.
	A glazed look swam into the survivors’ eyes;
	they caught a sort of dancing-sickness,
	a variation of the blind staggers,
	that hunched their narrow backs and struck
	a stiffened wing akimbo,
	as round and round the poultry yard
	they flapped and dropped and flapped again.
	The county agent shook his head:
	not one of them was spared the cyanide.
	
	That year of the cloud, when my marriage failed,
	I paced up and down the bottom-fields,
	tamping the mud-puddled nurslings in
	with a sharp blow of the heel
	timed to the chop-chop of the hoe:
	red pine and white, larch, balsam fir,
	one stride apart, two hundred to the row,
	until I heard from Rossiter’s woods
	the downward spiral of a veery’s song
	unwinding on the eve of war.
	
	Lord! Lord! who has lived so long?
	Count it ten thousand trees ago,
	five houses and ten thousand trees,
	since the swallows exploded from Bowman Tower
	over the place where the hermit sang,
	while I held a fantail of squirming roots
	that kissed the palm of my dirty hand,
	as if in reply to a bird.
	The stranger who hammers No Trespass signs
	to the staghorn sumac along the road
	must think he owns this property.
	I park my car below the curve
	and climbing over the tumbled stones
	where the wild foxgrape perseveres,
	I walk into the woods I made,
	my dark and resinous, blistered land,
	through the deep litter of the years.


7. THE ROUND

	Light splashed this morning
	on the shell-pink anemones
	swaying on their tall stems;
	down blue-spiked veronica
	light flowed in rivulets
	over the humps of the honeybees;
	this morning I saw light kiss
	the silk of the roses
	in their second flowering,
	my late bloomers
	flushed with their brandy.
	A curious gladness shook me.
	So I have shut the doors of my house,
	so I have trudged downstairs to my cell,
	so I am sitting in semi-dark
	hunched over my desk
	with nothing for a view
	to tempt me
	but a bloated compost heap,
	steamy old stinkpile,
	under my window;
	and I pick my notebook up
	and I start to read aloud
	the still-wet words I scribbled
	on the blotted page:
	“Light splashed . . .”
	
	I can scarcely wait till tomorrow
	when a new life begins for me,
	as it does each day,
	as it does each day.


8. THE SNAKES OF SEPTEMBER

	All summer I heard them
	rustling in the shrubbery,
	outracing me from tier
	to tier in my garden,
	a whisper among the viburnums,
	a signal flashed from the hedgerow,
	a shadow pulsing
	in the barberry thicket.
	Now that the nights are chill
	and the annuals spent,
	I should have thought them gone,
	in a torpor of blood
	slipped to the nether world
	before the sickle frost.
	Not so. In the deceptive balm
	of noon, as if defiant of the curse
	that spoiled another garden,
	these two appear on show
	through a narrow slit
	in the dense green brocade
	of a north-country spruce,
	dangling head-down, entwined
	in a brazen love-knot.
	I put out my hand and stroke
	the fine, dry grit of their skins.
	After all,
	we are partners in this land,
	co-signers of a covenant.
	At my touch the wild
	braid of creation
	trembles.


9. THE TESTING-TREE

	I
	
	On my way home from school
	up tribal Providence Hill
	past the Academy ballpark
	where I could never hope to play
	I scuffed in the drainage ditch
	among the sodden seethe of leaves
	hunting for perfect stones
	rolled out of glacial time
	into my pitcher’s hand;
	then sprinted lickety-
	split on my magic Keds
	from a crouching start,
	scarcely touching the ground
	with my flying skin
	as I poured it on
	for the prize of the mastery
	over that stretch of road,
	with no one no where to deny
	when I flung myself down
	that on the given course
	I was the world’s fastest human.
	
	
	II
	
	Around the bend
	that tried to loop me home
	dawdling came natural
	across a nettled field
	riddled with rabbit-life
	where the bees sank sugar-wells
	in the trunks of the maples
	and a stringy old lilac
	more than two stories tall
	blazing with mildew
	remembered a door in the
	long teeth of the woods.
	All of it happened slow:
	brushing the stickseed off,
	wading through jewelweed
	strangled by angel’s hair,
	spotting the print of the deer
	and the red fox’s scats.
	Once I owned the key
	to an umbrageous trail
	thickened with mosses
	where flickering presences
	gave me right of passage
	as I followed in the steps
	of straight-backed Massassoit
	soundlessly heel-and-toe
	practicing my Indian walk.
	
	
	III
	
	Past the abandoned quarry
	where the pale sun bobbed
	in the sump of the granite,
	past copperhead ledge,
	where the ferns gave foothold,
	I walked, deliberate,
	on to the clearing,
	with the stones in my pocket
	changing to oracles
	and my coiled ear tuned
	to the slightest leaf-stir.
	I had kept my appointment.
	There I stood int he shadow,
	at fifty measured paces,
	of the inexhaustible oak,
	tyrant and target,
	Jehovah of acorns,
	watchtower of the thunders,
	that locked King Philip’s War
	in its annulated core
	under the cut of my name.
	Father wherever you are
	I have only three throws
	bless my good right arm.
	In the haze of afternoon,
	while the air flowed saffron,
	I played my game for keeps--
	for love, for poetry,
	and for eternal life--
	after the trials of summer.
	
	
	IV
	
	In the recurring dream
	my mother stands
	in her bridal gown
	under the burning lilac,
	with Bernard Shaw and Bertie
	Russell kissing her hands;
	the house behind her is in ruins;
	she is wearing an owl’s face
	and makes barking noises.
	Her minatory finger points.
	I pass through the cardboard doorway
	askew in the field
	and peer down a well
	where an albino walrus huffs.
	He has the gentlest eyes.
	If the dirt keeps sifting in,
	staining the water yellow,
	why should I be blamed?
	Never try to explain.
	That single Model A
	sputtering up the grade
	unfurled a highway behind
	where the tanks maneuver,
	revolving their turrets.
	In a murderous time
	the heart breaks and breaks
	and lives by breaking.
	It is necessary to go
	through dark and deeper dark
	and not to turn.
	I am looking for the trail.
	Where is my testing-tree?
	Give me back my stones!
