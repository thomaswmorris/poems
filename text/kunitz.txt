*** Stanley Kunitz (1905 - 2006)


1. AFTER THE LAST DYNASTY

	Reading in Li Po
	how “the peach blossom follows the water”
	I keep thinking of you
	because you were so much like
	Chairman Mao,
	naturally with the sex
	transposed
	and the figure slighter.
	Loving you was a kind
	of Chinese guerrilla war.
	Thanks to your lightfoot genius
	no Eighth Route Army
	kept its lines more fluid,
	traveled with less baggage,
	so nibbled the advantage.
	Even with your small bad heart
	you made a dance of departures.
	In the cold spring rains
	when last you failed me
	I had nothing left to spend
	but a red crayon language
	on the character of the enemy
	to break appointments,
	to fight us not
	with his strength
	but with his weakness,
	to kill us
	not with his health
	but with his sickness.
	
	Pet, spitfire, blue-eyed pony,
	here is a new note
	I want to pin on your door,
	though I am ten years late
	and you are nowhere:
	Tell me,
	are you still mistress of the valley,
	what trophies drift down-river,
	why did you keep me waiting?



2. BENEDICTION

	God banish from your house
	The fly, the roach, the mouse
	
	That riots in the walls
	Until the plaster falls;
	
	Admonish from your door
	The hypocrite and liar;
	
	No shy, soft, tigrish fear
	Permit upon your stair,
	
	Nor agents of your doubt.
	God drive them whistling out.
	
	Let nothing touched with evil,
	Let nothing that can shrivel
	
	Heart’s tenderest frond, intrude
	Upon your still, deep blood.
	
	Against the drip of night
	God keep all windows tight,
	
	Protect your mirrors from
	Surprise, delirium,
	
	Admit no trailing wind
	Into your shuttered mind
	
	To plume the lake of sleep
	With dreams. If you must weep
	
	God give you tears, but leave
	You secrecy to grieve,
	
	And islands for your pride,
	And love to nest in your side.



3. BETWEEN THE ACTS

	Fate hired me once to play a villain’s part.
	I did it badly, wasting valued blood;
	Now when the call is given to the good
	It is that knave who answers in my heart.



4. THE DARK AND THE FAIR

	A roaring company that festive night;
	The beast of dialectic dragged his chains,
	Prowling from chair to chair in the smoking light,
	While the snow hissed against the windowpanes.
	
	Our politics, our science, and our faith
	Were whiskey on the tongue; I, being rent
	By the fierce divisions of our time, cried death
	And death again, and my own dying meant.
	
	Out of her secret life, that griffin-land
	Where ivory empires build their stage, she came,
	Putting in mine her small impulsive hand,
	Five-fingered gift, and the palm not tame.
	
	The moment clanged: beauty and terror danced
	To the wild vibration of a sister-bell,
	Whose unremitting stroke discountenanced
	The marvel that the mirrors blazed to tell.
	
	A darker image took this fairer form
	Who once, in the purgatory of my pride,
	When innocence betrayed me in a room
	Of mocking elders, swept handsome to my side,
	
	Until we rose together, arm in arm,
	And fled together back into the world.
	What brought her now, in the semblance of the warm.
	Out of cold spaces, damned by colder blood?
	
	That furied woman did me grievous wrong,
	But does it matter much, given our years?
	We learn, as the thread plays out, that we belong
	Less to what flatters us than to what scars;
	
	So, freshly turning, as the turn condones,
	For her I killed the propitiatory bird,
	Kissing her down. Peace to her bitter bones,
	Who taught me the serpent’s word, but yet the word.



5. A DAUGHTER OF THE SUN IS SHE

	A daughter of the sun is she,
	Delicate and neat,
	Whom a divine geometry
	Has made complete.
	
	The subtle air was spun with fire
	For a body bright and wild,
	Immaculate in clean desire,
	A strange wise child.
	
	With elemental grace of wind
	Her symmetry is plain;
	Precisely is each thought defined
	In her dainty brain.
	
	Her secret will not keep the night.
	What will her lover say
	When, springing on a horse of light,
	She rides away?



6. THE DAUGHTERS OF THE HORSELEECH

	The daughters of the horseleech crying “Give! Give!”
	Implore the young men for the blood of martyrs.
	How shall we keep the old senator alive
	Unless we satisfy his thirst for cultures?
	
	Entreat the rat, the weasel, and the fox
	To forage for their toothless master;
	Have mercy, boys, on the monkey in his box;
	Dear Judas goat, lead out the sheep to slaughter,
	
	For if the warlock with the gilded claws
	Withers away, and of his bones are waters,
	Who will transmute our foreheads into brass,
	And who will keep his five charming daughters?



7. THE END OF SUMMER

	An agitation of the air, A perturbation of the light
	Admonished me the unloved year
	Would turn on its hinge that night.
	 
	I stood in the disenchanted field
	Amid the stubble and the stones,
	Amazed, while a small worm lisped to me
	The song of my marrow-bones.
	 
	Blue poured into summer blue,
	A hawk broke from his cloudless tower,
	The roof of the silo blazed, and I knew
	That part of my life was over.
	 
	Already the iron door of the north
	Clangs open: birds, leaves, snows
	Order their populations forth,
	And a cruel wind blows.



8. FATHER AND SON

	Now in the suburbs and the falling light
	I followed him, and now down sandy road
	Whitter than bone-dust, through the sweet
	Curdle of fields, where the plums
	Dropped with their load of ripeness, one by one.
	Mile after mile I followed, with skimming feet,
	After the secret master of my blood,
	Him, steeped in the odor of ponds, whose indomitable love
	Kept me in chains. Strode years; stretched into bird;
	Raced through the sleeping country where I was young,
	The silence unrolling before me as I came,
	The night nailed like an orange to my brow.
	
	How should I tell him my fable and the fears,
	How bridge the chasm in a casual tone,
	Saying, “The house, the stucco one you built,
	We lost. Sister married and went from home,
	And nothing comes back, it’s strange, from where she goes.
	I lived on a hill that had too many rooms;
	Light we could make, but not enough of warmth,
	And when the light failed, I climbed under the hill.
	The papers are delivered every day;
	I am alone and never shed a tear.”
	
	At the water’s edge, where the smothering ferns lifted
	Their arms, “Father!“ I cried, “Return! You know
	The way. I’ll wipe the mudstains from your clothes;
	No trace, I promise, will remain. Instruct
	You son, whirling between two wars,
	In the Gemara of your gentleness,
	For I would be a child to those who mourn
	And brother to the foundlings of the field
	And friend of innocence and all bright eyes.
	0 teach me how to work and keep me kind.”
	
	Among the turtles and the lilies he turned to me
	The white ignorant hollow of his face.



9. FIRST LOVE

	At his incipient sun
	The ice of twenty winters broke,
	Crackling, in her eyes.
	
	Her mirroring, still mind,
	That held the world (made double) calm,
	Went Auid, and it ran.
	
	There was a stir of music,
	Mixed with flowers, in her blood;
	A swift impulsive balm
	
	From obscure roots; gold bees
	Of clinging light swarmed in her brow.
	This Beautiful is good,
	
	This Wonderful is true.
	Love’s large, slow, motherly hands have touched
	Like years; quietly now
	
	The blind impalpable lids
	Of prescient selves, opening, start
	Upon an astral view.
	
	Her throat is full of songs,
	She hums, she is sensible of wings
	Growing on her heart.
	
	She is a tree in spring
	Trembling with the hope of leaves,
	Of which the leaves are tongues.



10. THE GAME

	Let’s spin the bottle
	No I don’t want to be kissed
	
	Sometimes I feel my arm
	Is turning into a tree
	
	Or hardening to stone
	Past memory of green
	
	I’ve a long way to go
	Who never learned to pray
	
	O the night is coming on
	And I am nobody’s son
	
	Father it’s true
	But only for a day



11. GOOSE POND

	Goose Pond’s imaginable snows,
	The fall of twenty years at once,
	Like subtler moons reflect the rose
	Decompositions of the sun.
	
	A feather tumbling from a cloud
	Scrolls thunders of the natural law;
	The cat-tails rattle; cinnamon-fern
	Raises rag banners towards the thaw,
	
	And early-footed ghost-flowers scour
	Through willow-dapplings to a cave
	Where secrecy grows fur. Self burns
	At the pulpits where Jack-preachers rave!
	
	Now a sulky weather dogs the heart,
	There is no bottom to the day,
	The water-lily’s Chinese stalk
	Drags heavy, as the white-lipped boy
	
	Climbs from detritus of his birth,
	The rusted hoop, the broken wheels,
	The sunken boat of little worth,
	Past balconies of limber eels
	
	Until, along that marshy brink,
	The springy trails devoid of plan,
	He meets his childhood beating back
	To find what furies made him man.



12. THE GUILTY MAN

	The years of my life were odd that now are even.
	Think! to be young, amused, and not a fool;
	Playing the world’s game--think!--with world’s own rules,
	And nothing lost, I think, I think . . . but years.
	Heart against mouth is singing out of tune,
	Night’s whisperings and blanks betrayed; this is
	The end of lies: my bones are angry with me.
	
	Father, the darkness of the self goes out
	And spreads contagion on the flowing air.
	I walk obscurely in a cloud of dark:
	Yea, when I kneeled, the dark kneeled down with me.
	Touch me: my folds and my defenses fall;
	I stand within myself, myself my shield.
	
	Teach me my reasons, I would know their names,
	Cry havoc, drive my secrets out, because
	I hate the excellence that spoils the world.
	Depart from me, therefore, you virtuous men
	Whose treason is to turn the conscience kind.
	None may forgive us for the ancient wrongs.



13. THE HARSH JUDGMENT

	Inside, a hundred doors by which to leave;
	Outside, you never can come in again.
	The gesture made is woven in the sleeve,
	The spiral echo sinks into the grain,
	What died in me will warn me if you turn
	Not to be tender-minded, though I burn,
	In time so cruel, so difficult for love.
	
	The burden of the personal, the life
	By profit ploughed, the tapping of our power--
	You know the long rebellion and the spleen.
	Last night, last year, with the tumbling of a leaf
	The autumn came. Dark leaf from darker tower
	Falls miles, deeper than coals, and still goes down.
	Courage! That pity made our hearts unclean.



14. I DREAMED THAT I WAS OLD

	I dreamed that I was old: in stale declension   
	Fallen from my prime, when company
	Was mine, cat-nimbleness, and green invention,   
	Before time took my leafy hours away.
	
	My wisdom, ripe with body’s ruin, found   
	Itself tart recompense for what was lost
	In false exchange: since wisdom in the ground   
	Has no apocalypse or pentecost.
	
	I wept for my youth, sweet passionate young thought,
	And cozy women dead that by my side   
	Once lay: I wept with bitter longing, not   
	Remembering how in my youth I cried.



15. THE ILLUSIONIST

	My name is sand: I make
	Dumbshows on windowshades;
	Wring hands; dissolve; swirl back;
	Play furious, grim charades.
	In airless room confined.
	Thick with the curds of night,
	I live upon my mind,
	Am six-foot parasite;
	Am envy, like a vein
	Run dry; am hypocrite,
	Whose bonecase (melted down)
	Shimmers with scaly wit.
	What have I not permitted?
	What flagrant postures taken?
	Nor shown the head matted
	Nor the white forehead broken,
	But parodied my life,
	Assumed eccentric forms,
	Retreated into leaf,
	Made branches of my arms;
	Groveled; ah clung in hiding
	To my father’s rotten wall.
	
	_Kneel, spirit. At this beheading
	Thy spongy faces fall._



16. KING OF THE RIVER

	If the water were clear enough,
	if the water were still,
	but the water is not clear,
	the water is not still,
	you would see yourself,
	slipped out of your skin,
	nosing upstream,
	slapping, thrashing,
	tumbling
	over the rocks
	till you paint them
	with your belly’s blood:
	Finned Ego,
	yard of muscle that coils,
	uncoils.
	If the knowledge were given you,
	but it is not given,
	for the membrane is clouded
	with self-deceptions
	and the iridescent image swims
	through a mirror that flows,
	you would surprise yourself
	in that other flesh
	heavy with milt,
	bruised, battering toward the dam
	that lips the orgiastic pool.
	
	Come. Bathe in these waters.
	Increase and die.
	
	If the power were granted you
	to break out of your cells,
	but the imagination fails
	and the doors of the senses close
	on the child within,
	you would dare to be changed,
	as you are changing now,
	into the shape you dread
	beyond the merely human.
	A dry fire eats you.
	Fat drips from your bones.
	The flutes of your gills discolor.
	You have become a ship for parasites.
	The great clock of your life
	is slowing down,
	and the small clocks run wild.
	For this you were born.
	You have cried to the wind
	and heard the wind’s reply:
	“I did not choose the way,
	the way chose me.”
	You have tasted the fire on your tongue
	till it is swollen black
	with a prophetic joy:
	“Burn with me!
	The only music is time,
	the only dance is love.”
	
	If the heart were pure enough,
	but it is not pure,
	you would admit
	that nothing compels you
	any more, nothing
	at all abides,
	but nostalgia and desire,
	the two-way ladder
	between heaven and hell.
	On the threshold
	of the last mystery,
	at the brute absolute hour,
	you have looked into the eyes
	of your creature self,
	which are glazed with madness,
	and you say
	he is not broken but endures,
	limber and firm
	in the state of his shining,
	forever inheriting his salt kingdom,
	from which he is banished
	forever.



17. THE LAST QUESTION

	Oh the good times! the laughter on the hill!
	The parties down at Larry’s in the spring!
	Your sovereign pleasure, careless itself to save,
	Goes naked at the heart. Touching, you bring
	Rumors of heaven and its generous spoils
	Here, even, where our hooded shadows rise
	To play the stab-scene, the end of love,
	While grief intones, ever the third that stays.
	Now that your pity shines in other hall,
	Now that your grain again comes to the mill,
	Shall I be happy soon, shall I rejoice,
	Or wrestle with that stranger whom you praise?



18. LAST WORDS

	Listen: from sleep’s long pillow I arise
	To go away. One moment let me lean
	On falling air before I lock my eyes.
	Are the leaves red now? No matter. Trees are green.
	
	The colors of the world are permanent
	Despite the bleach of change. Pure stain on stain
	The bow of light’s eternal forms is bent
	Across steep heaven in the general brain.
	
	Who cries,
	“The beautiful, the proud, are fallen!”
	(O silly child, it was myself that cried.)
	Death, eater of the heads of flowers, spills pollen:
	Our little strength, our beauty, and our pride
	
	Are for the race to keep; we can discover
	Secrets with our broken skulls; our dead feet run
	Under the lid of earth that closes over
	The generations marching to the sun.



19. THE LAYERS

	I have walked through many lives,
	some of them my own,
	and I am not who I was,
	though some principle of being
	abides, from which I struggle
	not to stray.
	When I look behind,
	as I am compelled to look
	before I can gather strength
	to proceed on my journey,
	I see the milestones dwindling
	toward the horizon
	and the slow fires trailing
	from the abandoned camp-sites,
	over which scavenger angels
	wheel on heavy wings.
	Oh, I have made myself a tribe
	out of my true affections,
	and my tribe is scattered!
	How shall the heart be reconciled
	to its feast of losses?
	In a rising wind
	the manic dust of my friends,
	those who fell along the way,
	bitterly stings my face.
	Yet I turn, I turn,
	exulting somewhat,
	with my will intact to go
	wherever I need to go,
	and every stone on the road
	precious to me.
	In my darkest night,
	when the moon was covered
	and I roamed through wreckage,
	a nimbus-clouded voice
	directed me:
	“Live in the layers,
	not on the litter.”
	Though I lack the art
	to decipher it,
	no doubt the next chapter
	in my book of transformations
	is already written.
	I am not done with my changes.



20. THE MAN IN THE PARK

	The people made a ring
	Around the man in the park.
	He was our banished king
	Of blames and staunchless flows,
	Exhibitor of the dark
	Abominable rose;
	
	Our chief, returned at last
	From exile, with the grim
	Stamina of the lost,
	To show his sovereign hurt.
	Wildly we dreaded him
	And the menace of his heart
	
	Unbosomed, crawling down
	Ditches where papers blow,
	Smearing the sills of the town,
	Strangling the hydra-drains
	Coiled under. Stop! we know
	How much a man contains.
	
	We picnicked all that day,
	Dishonored signs that nayed us,
	Pulled marigolds, were gay
	Before the apes, smashed glass.
	Rifles could not have made us
	Keep off the bloody grass;
	
	For we were sick of crimes
	Against us, and the head
	Pitched on the absorbing _Times_,
	And no one to accuse,
	And nothing paid for, and we read,
	We read that day what blotted out the news.



21. MASTER AND MISTRESS

	As if I were composed of dust and air,
	The shape confronting me upon the stair
	(Athlete of shadow, lighted by a stain
	On its disjunctive breast--I saw it plain--)
	Moved through my middle flesh. I turned around,
	Shaken and it was marching without sound
	Beyond the door; and when my hand was taken
	
	From my mouth to beat the standing heart, I cried
	My distant name, thinking myself had died.
	One moment I was entered; one moment then
	I knew a total century of pain
	Between the twinkling of two thoughts. The ghost
	Knocked on my ribs, demanding, “Host! Host!
	I am diseased with motion. Give me bread
	Before I quickly go. Shall I be fed?”
	Yielding, I begged of him: “Partake of me.
	Whatever runneth from the artery,
	This body and its unfamiliar wine,
	Stored in whatever dark of love, are thine.”
	But he denied me, saying, “Every part
	of thee is given, yea, thy flesh, thy heart.”



22. THE MULCH

	A man with a leaf in his head
	watches an indefatigable gull
	dropping a piss-clam on the rocks
	to break it open.
	Repeat. Repeat.
	He is an inlander
	who loves the margins of the sea,
	and everywhere he goes he carries
	a bag of earth on his back.
	Why is he down in the tide marsh?
	Why is he gathering salt hay
	in bushel baskets crammed to his chin?
	“It is a blue and northern air,”
	he says, as if the shiftings of the sky
	had taught him husbandry.
	Birthdays for him are when he wakes
	and falls into the news of weather.
	“Try! Try!” clicks the beetle in his wrist,
	his heart is an educated swamp,
	and he is mindful of his garden,
	which prepares to die.



23. MY SURGEONS

	My surgeons are a savage band,
	Surely their patient is ill-fated.
	Their tricks are coarse: the small sweet hand
	I seized was wax, or amputated.
	With the humiliated swollen-footed
	And the lost persecuted their traps are baited.
	
	Deftly they opened the brain of a child,
	And it was full of flying dreams;
	Father was prowling in a field
	With speckled tongue and a collar of flame.
	They labeled it, “Polluted Streams,
	The body floating with the name.
	
	They studied a prostrate fever-chart
	With unmitigating eyes; one said,
	“Bohemian germs, Weltschmerz, bad art
	And Spanish fly. Off with his head.”
	Another, “Fascist. His boot is filled with blood.”
	They cut me up till I was red.
	
	Lastly they squeezed out of my veins
	The bright liquor of sympathy;
	I lost the touch of souls, the reins
	On white revenge, and I was free
	Of pity, a solid man of snow.
	But in the night to whom could I go?
	
	Lie down with me, dear girl, before
	My butcher-boys begin to rave.
	“No hope for persons any more,”
	They cry, “on either side of the grave.”
	Tell them I say the heart forgives
	The world. Yes, I believe. In love.



24. OFF POINT LOTUS

	Three years I lolled in that country of the girls,
	Thick with their wine, their loose idolatry,
	Nor saw that I was only prince of gulls,
	Nor heard the ambiguous whisper of the sea.
	
	Used . . . used! Eating their morphine leaf,
	I breathed a cloud of self-congratulations
	To pillow me, while my boat slapped on the wharf
	And twenty spiders scribbled invitations.
	
	All right, my bully-boys, you who connived
	My fall, I thank you for your dirty part,
	I kiss you for each lie you took to wife
	And for that salt you packed around my heart.
	
	Goodbye, old things, I am forever lost!
	My crazy vessel dances to the rail,
	Sea-drunken since I left that barbarous coast,
	The stain of anger spreading on my sail.



25. THE OLD CLOTHES MAN

	Have you any old clothes to sell?
	The years make a stain you can’t conceal,
	Your fabric’s eaten, you discard
	That part of your life for which you cared.
	
	You pluck a thread from your cuff; it winces
	Straight to your shoulder. Ambition grieves
	In trunks and bags; moth-featured, minces
	From closets, beating empty sleeves.
	
	History stagnates in your house.
	I smelt the ruinous time, will buy
	Your waste of talent. There’s an ooze
	Of souls too virulent to die
	
	Contagious on the baffling walls.
	You sit and watch the ceiling crack;
	Horror sifts through and softly falls
	From worlds beyond the zodiac.
	
	You fear the penitential bone
	That growls in your breast, and the mind’s long feather,
	The heart that imitates a stone,
	And if your hands should grow together
	
	And violence unstring your voice.
	I know what hangs behind your stair,
	Spoiling with conscience and disuse:
	The uniform you never wear,
	
	The fitness and the pride, so vilely
	Dishonored, the smiling target mouth,
	Innocence ambushed, in the sharp volley
	Reeling before the huntsmen of youth.
	
	Therefore I come to mobilize
	Your poor blind wounds, as in the coat,
	The form betrayed, the defeated eyes,
	My brother my groom, my dear recruit.
	
	There will be skirmishing and loot
	And fires to light our marches. Let
	The enemies of life beware
	When these old clothes shall go to war.



26. PASSING THROUGH

	Nobody in the widow’s household
	ever celebrated anniversaries.
	In the secrecy of my room
	I would not admit I cared
	that my friends were given parties.
	Before I left town for school
	my birthday went up in smoke
	in a fire at City Hall that gutted
	the Department of Vital Statistics.
	If it weren’t for a census report
	of a five-year-old White Male
	sharing my mother’s address
	at the Green Street tenement in Worcester
	I’d have no documentary proof
	that I exist. You are the first,
	my dear, to bully me
	into these festive occasions.
	
	Sometimes, you say, I wear
	an abstracted look that drives you
	up the wall, as though it signified
	distress or disaffection.
	Don’t take it so to heart.
	Maybe I enjoy not-being as much
	as being who I am. Maybe
	it’s time for me to practice
	growing old. The way I look
	at it, I’m passing through a phase:
	gradually I’m changing to a word.
	Whatever you choose to claim
	of me is always yours:
	nothing is truly mine
	except my name. I only
	borrowed this dust.



27. POEM

	O Heart: this is a dream I had, or not a dream.
	Lovingly, lovingly, I wept, but my tears did not rhyme.
	
	In the year of my mother’s blood, when I was born,
	She buried my innocent head in a field, because the earth
	
	Was sleepy with the winter. And I spoke the corn,
	And I cried the clover up, with the dewy mouth of my mirth.
	
	In the honey of summer my brain conceived: a child, I flowered
	Over the maiden-stalks, drinking sweet upper light,
	
	For I was intimate with the sun, till he devoured
	Me utterly, O Heart, his tenderest neophyte.
	
	So I died. Small gluttonous birds picked on my limpid brow,
	My pale drooped feet were manacled with rushing worms;
	
	And when I was sufficiently dead (torturer thou!)
	I was born again. Dissolving, memory reforms
	
	The cyclic hour I pulled life’s bony root, slow inch
	By inch, from its loamy trap; shrilly, like a mandrake, screamed
	
	To rip the cord, suck liberal air, after the pinch
	Of planetary rock. Womanly, a shadow combed
	
	Her dark tremendous hair beyond the violet border
	Of my sleep. Strong passionate hands I had, but could not find
	
	The red position of her heart, nor the subtle order
	Of her lips and breasts, nor the breathing cities of her mind.
	
	Lovingly, lovingly, I wept for her absent eyes,
	Large pity of her thought; I broke the spine of my pride
	
	Upon a stone, seeing she did not recognize
	My tears, because our sorrows did not coincide.
	
	Softly grieving, ironic with a smile forlorn,
	I took my baffled head and buried it under the corn.
	
	O Heart: this is a dream I had, or not a dream.



28. POSTSCRIPT

	Darling, darling, by narrow ambages
	Of fate, by gardens flowering with beasts,
	I came unto this place. The forest marches
	Behind the stalker, and the running grass
	Steps lightly over his defeated bones.
	This is the perilous way without return.
	In glassy prison now of contemplation
	I, fugitive from progress, leap erect
	In analytic dance on time’s acute
	And bitter needle. Crueler than a spine,
	It penetrates the body till it pricks
	The bubbling brain, exploding life’s grey tumor
	Together with its iridescent world.
	I lost by winning, and I shall not win
	Again except by loss. The smoky past,
	Mixed with the wind, will not evaporate
	Into the color of air. Let life be false,
	But in our circular trap the blood remembers
	Its throbbing on the lip; the hands observe
	Communion, touching in the sleep of thought;
	And the punctual heart reiterates love’s name.
	Some little comfort I have found to think
	That though this phoenix will not hatch an egg,
	Yet will its lyric history be saved
	In generations of its mental brood.
	And I have found some little comfort too
	In colloquy with death the quiet-eyed,
	Our profound and inexhaustible old father,
	Still loyal to his tall obedient sons.
	I have been social with the pale abstractions
	That congregate within a lethal room;
	But these strict walls encounter me; this house
	Exhales resentment of audacious hope.
	A man can starve upon the golden-sweet
	Impossible apples of Cézanne; a man
	Can eagerly consult a woman’s head
	(Picasso’s), but her slow and stupid eyes
	Drink light in vegetative apathy.
	O darling, a man can cry unto his love
	All night and day, and still be comfortless.
	The meaning of a mouth, a breast, is plain,
	But what you mean to me is dipped in blood
	And tangled like the bright threads of a dream.



29. PROPECHY OF LETHE

	Echo, the beating of the tide,
	Infringes on the blond curved shore;
	Archaic weeds from sleep’s green side
	Bind skull and pelvis till the four
	Seasons of the blood are unified.
	
	Anonymous sweet carrion,
	Blind mammal floating on the stream
	Of depthless sound, completely one
	In the cinnamon-dark of no dream:--
	A pod of silence, bursting when the sun
	
	Clings to the forehead, will surprise
	The gasping turtle and the leech
	With your strange brain blooming as it lies
	Abandoned to the bipeds on the beach;
	Your jelly-mouth and, crushed, your polyp eyes.



30. REFLECTION BY A MAILBOX

	When I stand in the center of that man’s madness,
	Deep in his trauma, as in the crater of a wound,
	My ancestors step from my American bones.
	There’s mother in a woven shawl, and that,
	No doubt, is father picking up his pack
	For the return voyage through those dreadful years
	Into the winter of the raging eye.
	
	One generation past, two days by plane away,
	My house is dispossessed, my friends dispersed,
	My teeth and pride knocked in, my people game
	For the hunters of man-skins in the warrens of Europe,
	The impossible creatures of an hysteric’s dream
	Advancing with hatchets sunk into their skulls
	To rip the god out of the machines.
	
	Are these the citizens of the new estate
	To which the continental selves aspire;
	Or the powerful get of a dying age, corrupt
	And passion-smeared, with fluid on their lips,
	As if a soul had been given to petroleum?
	
	How shall we uncreate that lawless energy?
	
	Now I wait under the hemlock by the road
	For the red-haired postman with the smiling hand
	To bring me my passport to the war.
	Familiarly his car shifts into gear
	Around the curve; he coasts up to my drive; the day
	Strikes noon; I think of Pavlov and his dogs
	And the motto carved on the broad lintel of his brain:
	“Sequence, consequence, and again consequence.”



31. RIVER ROAD

	That year of the cloud, when my marriage failed,
	I slept in a chair, by the flagstone hearth,
	fighting my sleep,
	and one night saw a Hessian soldier
	stand at attention there in full
	regalia, till his head broke into flames.
	My only other callers were the FBI
	sent to investigate me as a Russian spy
	by patriotic neighbors on the river road;
	and flying squirrels parachuting from the elms
	who squeaked in rodent heat between the walls
	and upstairs rumbled at their nutty games.
	I never dared open the attic door.
	Even my nervous Leghorns joined the act,
	indulging their taste for chicken from behind.
	A glazed look swam into the survivors’ eyes;
	they caught a sort of dancing-sickness,
	a variation of the blind staggers,
	that hunched their narrow backs and struck
	a stiffened wing akimbo,
	as round and round the poultry yard
	they flapped and dropped and flapped again.
	The county agent shook his head:
	not one of them was spared the cyanide.
	
	That year of the cloud, when my marriage failed,
	I paced up and down the bottom-fields,
	tamping the mud-puddled nurslings in
	with a sharp blow of the heel
	timed to the chop-chop of the hoe:
	red pine and white, larch, balsam fir,
	one stride apart, two hundred to the row,
	until I heard from Rossiter’s woods
	the downward spiral of a veery’s song
	unwinding on the eve of war.
	
	Lord! Lord! who has lived so long?
	Count it ten thousand trees ago,
	five houses and ten thousand trees,
	since the swallows exploded from Bowman Tower
	over the place where the hermit sang,
	while I held a fantail of squirming roots
	that kissed the palm of my dirty hand,
	as if in reply to a bird.
	The stranger who hammers No Trespass signs
	to the staghorn sumac along the road
	must think he owns this property.
	I park my car below the curve
	and climbing over the tumbled stones
	where the wild foxgrape perseveres,
	I walk into the woods I made,
	my dark and resinous, blistered land,
	through the deep litter of the years.



32. ROBIN REDBREAST

	It was the dingiest bird
	you ever saw, all the color
	washed from him, as if
	he had been standing in the rain,
	friendless and stiff and cold,
	since Eden went wrong.
	In the house marked For Sale,
	where nobody made a sound,
	in the room where I lived
	with an empty page, I had heard
	the squawking of the jays
	under the wild persimmons
	tormenting him.
	So I scooped him up
	after they knocked him down,
	in league with that ounce of heart
	pounding in my palm,
	that dumb beak gaping
	Poor thing! Poor foolish life!
	without sense enough to stop
	running in desperate circles,
	needing my lucky help
	to toss him back into his element.
	But when I held him high,
	fear clutched my hand,
	for through the hole in his head,
	cut whistle-clean . . .
	through the old dried wound
	between his eyes
	where the hunter’s brand
	had tunneled out his wits . . .
	I caught the cold flash of the blue
	unappeasable sky.



33. THE ROUND

	Light splashed this morning
	on the shell-pink anemones
	swaying on their tall stems;
	down blue-spiked veronica
	light flowed in rivulets
	over the humps of the honeybees;
	this morning I saw light kiss
	the silk of the roses
	in their second flowering,
	my late bloomers
	flushed with their brandy.
	A curious gladness shook me.
	So I have shut the doors of my house,
	so I have trudged downstairs to my cell,
	so I am sitting in semi-dark
	hunched over my desk
	with nothing for a view
	to tempt me
	but a bloated compost heap,
	steamy old stinkpile,
	under my window;
	and I pick my notebook up
	and I start to read aloud
	the still-wet words I scribbled
	on the blotted page:
	“Light splashed . . .”
	
	I can scarcely wait till tomorrow
	when a new life begins for me,
	as it does each day,
	as it does each day.



34. THE SNAKES OF SEPTEMBER

	All summer I heard them
	rustling in the shrubbery,
	outracing me from tier
	to tier in my garden,
	a whisper among the viburnums,
	a signal flashed from the hedgerow,
	a shadow pulsing
	in the barberry thicket.
	Now that the nights are chill
	and the annuals spent,
	I should have thought them gone,
	in a torpor of blood
	slipped to the nether world
	before the sickle frost.
	Not so. In the deceptive balm
	of noon, as if defiant of the curse
	that spoiled another garden,
	these two appear on show
	through a narrow slit
	in the dense green brocade
	of a north-country spruce,
	dangling head-down, entwined
	in a brazen love-knot.
	I put out my hand and stroke
	the fine, dry grit of their skins.
	After all,
	we are partners in this land,
	co-signers of a covenant.
	At my touch the wild
	braid of creation
	trembles.



35. A SPARK OF LAUREL

	This man, this poet, said,
	“I’ve carried in my head
	For twenty years and more
	Some lines you wrote before
	I knew the meaning of
	Euripides or love”
	And gravely then intoned,
	Lured from the underground
	The greekness of my song
	Still melancholy-young;
	While she, long since forgotten,
	For whom the song was written,
	Burned wanton once again
	Through centuries of rain,
	Smiling, as she must do,
	To keep her legend true,
	And struck the mortal blow,
	But not that blood could flow.
	Ha! Once again I heard
	The transubstantial word
	That is not mine to speak
	Unless I break, I break;
	The spiral verb that weaves
	Through the crystal of our lives,
	Of myth and water made
	And incoherent blood;
	What sirens on the coast
	Trilled to Ulysses lost,
	And Agamemnon’s thigh
	Opened at length to cry:
	
	_This laurel-sparking rhyme
	That we repeat in time
	Until the fathers rest
	On the inhuman breast
	That is both fire and stone,
	Mother and mistress, one._



36. THE SUPPER BEFORE LAST

	The intellectuals at the feast,
	Emaciated on their fare,
	Clap hands at the fabulous new beast
	Upon the massive platter borne.
	Their tongues rejoice, steeped in the rare
	Tuices of the unicorn,
	While drunk with ptomaines now, the crow
	That hoarsely to the table came,
	Snatches at gobbets flung below,
	And smirking in his greasy frock
	Clamps beak on the honeyed mortal game
	Under the dreaming hip and hock.



37. THE TESTING-TREE

	I
	
	On my way home from school
	up tribal Providence Hill
	past the Academy ballpark
	where I could never hope to play
	I scuffed in the drainage ditch
	among the sodden seethe of leaves
	hunting for perfect stones
	rolled out of glacial time
	into my pitcher’s hand;
	then sprinted lickety-
	split on my magic Keds
	from a crouching start,
	scarcely touching the ground
	with my flying skin
	as I poured it on
	for the prize of the mastery
	over that stretch of road,
	with no one no where to deny
	when I flung myself down
	that on the given course
	I was the world’s fastest human.
	
	
	II
	
	Around the bend
	that tried to loop me home
	dawdling came natural
	across a nettled field
	riddled with rabbit-life
	where the bees sank sugar-wells
	in the trunks of the maples
	and a stringy old lilac
	more than two stories tall
	blazing with mildew
	remembered a door in the
	long teeth of the woods.
	All of it happened slow:
	brushing the stickseed off,
	wading through jewelweed
	strangled by angel’s hair,
	spotting the print of the deer
	and the red fox’s scats.
	Once I owned the key
	to an umbrageous trail
	thickened with mosses
	where flickering presences
	gave me right of passage
	as I followed in the steps
	of straight-backed Massassoit
	soundlessly heel-and-toe
	practicing my Indian walk.
	
	
	III
	
	Past the abandoned quarry
	where the pale sun bobbed
	in the sump of the granite,
	past copperhead ledge,
	where the ferns gave foothold,
	I walked, deliberate,
	on to the clearing,
	with the stones in my pocket
	changing to oracles
	and my coiled ear tuned
	to the slightest leaf-stir.
	I had kept my appointment.
	There I stood int he shadow,
	at fifty measured paces,
	of the inexhaustible oak,
	tyrant and target,
	Jehovah of acorns,
	watchtower of the thunders,
	that locked King Philip’s War
	in its annulated core
	under the cut of my name.
	Father wherever you are
	I have only three throws
	bless my good right arm.
	In the haze of afternoon,
	while the air flowed saffron,
	I played my game for keeps--
	for love, for poetry,
	and for eternal life--
	after the trials of summer.
	
	
	IV
	
	In the recurring dream
	my mother stands
	in her bridal gown
	under the burning lilac,
	with Bernard Shaw and Bertie
	Russell kissing her hands;
	the house behind her is in ruins;
	she is wearing an owl’s face
	and makes barking noises.
	Her minatory finger points.
	I pass through the cardboard doorway
	askew in the field
	and peer down a well
	where an albino walrus huffs.
	He has the gentlest eyes.
	If the dirt keeps sifting in,
	staining the water yellow,
	why should I be blamed?
	Never try to explain.
	That single Model A
	sputtering up the grade
	unfurled a highway behind
	where the tanks maneuver,
	revolving their turrets.
	In a murderous time
	the heart breaks and breaks
	and lives by breaking.
	It is necessary to go
	through dark and deeper dark
	and not to turn.
	I am looking for the trail.
	Where is my testing-tree?
	Give me back my stones!



38. THE THIEF

	In a Roman tram, where the famous Roman mob,
	Wrung from the bowels of the hippodrome,
	Mauled into shape its many-elbowed god
	To fight for exit through its civil wars,
	Somebody Roman picked my pocket clean.
	A pagan and a Christian curse on him!
	Somebody Roman, may he find tonight
	In the street of the serpents or the lion’s mouth,
	Strewn on a wine-soaked board,
	More than he reached for, more than cash,
	Green trumpeters, for whom the legions march
	Through solid stone. (Meanwhile the Carthaginians
	Play redskins in the ambush of the sea
	To whom must be meted out the standard destruction:
	It is a heavy responsibility.)
	
	Let the _ladrone_ sneer
	As the leathered fold yields him my haunt of years,
	The papers of a life I wanted lost,
	Memos, addresses, the snapshot of a child,
	To plague him through his alley nights until
	He begs for mercy for the thing well-robbed.
	Worlds in my pocket older than his own,
	May they erupt on him like hissing gold,
	Tooth of the pythoness, chimaera’s scales,
	Stones of the temple and Isaiah’s beard--
	Toss him, sweet Furies, from Tarpeia’s Rock!
	
	More even than my purse,
	And that’s no laughing matter, it is my pride
	That has been hurt: a fine Italian hand,
	With its mimosa touch, has made me feel
	Blind-skinned, indelicate, a fool Americano
	Touring a culture like a grand museum,
	People and statues interchangeable shows,
	Perception blunted as one’s syntax fails.
	Why am I here? Some thirty years ago
	A set of lantern slides I saw at school
	Of these antiquities gave me an image
	Of the rare serene that brimmed my eyes,
	For nothing pleased me then in my legacy;
	But the past that tempted me, the frozen pure,
	Was a pedagogic lie. All’s motion here,
	And motion like emotion is impure,
	A flower flawed by mutability,
	Religion by its ruins, and yet thereby
	More lovely and more graced, perhaps
	More true. Still, still the chariot wheels
	Turn, the assassin motorcyclists charge,
	Wolves prowl in the streets under arcades of bells,
	Tiberius grovels through his dungeon halls
	Dreaming of boy-sized fishes in his bath;
	Behind the balcony of the Cardinal’s palace,
	Smelling the laureled Mamertine blood,
	A bald-pate awaits his rhetorical cue,
	And the clouds drift
	Through a triumph of broken columns.
	
	Pick-pocket, pick-thank music plucks the strings
	For the rag-madonna with perdurable babe
	Most dolorously hallowing the square
	Where Caesar walks three steps to meet Bernini,
	Whose sumptuous art runs wild
	From gate to gate, pausing in tiptoe-joy
	Only to light a torch of fountains, to set
	His tritons dancing, or at a blest façade
	To cast up from his wrist a flight of angels,
	Volute on volute, wing on climbing wing.
	In the middle of my life I heard the waters playing.
	
	Mater Cloaca, feast thee well, I pray,
	On what has been subtracted from my fate--
	Ten days of lectures, thirty days abroad:
	In this excess that’s Rome I’ll not mope long,
	Wearing my heart less Roman than baroque,
	Though damn it all! I wish I’d lived in style,
	Jogged in _carrozze_ round and round the town,
	Guzzled Spumante by the bucket-full,
	Bought wagons of daffodils to please my dear.
	Now that I face the moment and the loss,
	Driven to language on the Ides of March
	Here in my blistered room
	Where the wind flaps my ceiling like a sail
	(A miracle, no doubt, to be left at that!)
	I recognize the gods’ capricious hand
	And write this poem for money, rage, and love.



39. THIS DAY THIS WORLD

	My architects, forsaking me,
	Submit designs for a bomb-proof mansion;
	My scholars of the fourth dimension
	Complain they starve to death in three;
	My correspondents write all day
	The business of the enemy.
	Tapped of their useful energies
	My soldiers pace the mind’s frontier;
	Engine recoils from engineer
	And strikes at the courage in his eyes.
	When shall my swarthy workmen rise,
	Demand the power and the keys?



40. THREE FLOORS

	Mother was a crack of light
	And a gray eye peeping;
	I made believe by breathing hard
	That I was sleeping.
	
	Sister’s doughboy on last leave
	Had robbed me of her hand;
	Downstairs at intervals she played
	_Warum_ on the baby grand.
	
	Under the roof a wardrobe trunk
	Whose lock a boy could pick
	Contained a red Masonic hat
	And a walking stick.
	
	Bolt upright in my bed that night
	I saw my father flying.
	The wind was walking on my neck,
	The window-panes were crying.



41. THE TUTORED CHILD

	Your mother, whom the mirror-world has claimed.
	Plucks at the tell-tale hairs with violent hand
	And thinks time backward to a brassy song,
	Rolling the grape of hysteria under her tongue.
	
	Your father, in whom two ambitions rave,
	Like stations wrangling on the foreign-wave
	For spheres of influence, loathes the heart that blends
	His guilty love; but the quarrel never ends.
	
	You are of nature’s bright unlucky brood,
	Born of the drop of talent in your blood
	Wherewith the gates of mystery are oiled.
	Mortals will touch you and your taste be spoiled,
	
	Witches in metals test you. I observe
	Defeat, taking short cuts from nerve to nerve,
	Climb through the narrow transom of your will;
	And I weep, for having made you vulnerable.
	
	My poor poor child whose terrors never cease.
	Here is my pity penny. Buy you peace.



42. TWILIGHT

	I wait. I deepen in the room.
	Fed lions, glowing, congregate
	In corners, sleep and fade. For whom
	It may concern, I, tawny, wait.
	
	Time flowing through the window; day
	Spilling on the board its bright
	Last blood. Folding--big, gauzy, gray--
	A moth sits on the western light.
	
	Sits on my heart that, darkened, drips
	No honey from its punctured core,
	Yet feeds my hands and feeds my lips.
	The Moon, the Moon, is at the door!



43. VITA NUOVA

	I abdicate my daily self that bled,
	As others breathe, for porridge it might sup.
	Henceforth apocalypse will get my bread
	For me. I bit my tongue and gnawed my lip,
	But now the visor of my name is up.
	
	Giving to love my undivided nature,
	Cherishing beauty with the breath I keep,
	I have been otherwise a part-time creature,
	With many selves to fool myself with hope,
	And in myself a gentler self to weep.
	
	Now I will peel that vision from my brain
	Of numbers wrangling in a common place,
	And I will go, unburdened, on the quiet lane
	Of my eternal kind, till shadowless
	With inner light I wear my father’s face.
	
	Moon of the soul, accompany me now,
	Shine on the coliseums of my sense,
	Be in the tabernacles of my brow.
	My dark will make, reflecting thee at once,
	The single beam of all my life intense.
