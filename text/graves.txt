*** Robert Graves (1895 - 1985)


1. ADVICE TO LOVERS

	I knew an old man at a Fair
	Who made it his twice-yearly task
	To clamber on a cider cask
	And cry to all the yokels there:--
	
	“Lovers to-day and for all time
	Preserve the meaning of my rhyme:
	Love is not kindly nor yet grim
	But does to you as you to him.
	
	“Whistle, and Love will come to you,
	Hiss, and he fades without a word,
	Do wrong, and he great wrong will do,
	Speak, he retells what he has heard.
	
	“Then all you lovers have good heed
	Vex not young Love in word or deed:
	Love never leaves an unpaid debt,
	He will not pardon nor forget.”
	
	The old man’s voice was sweet yet loud
	And this shows what a man was he,
	He’d scatter apples to the crowd
	And give great draughts of cider, free.


2. A CHILD’S NIGHTMARE

	Through long nursery nights he stood
	By my bed unwearying,
	Loomed gigantic, formless, queer,
	Purring in my haunted ear
	That same hideous nightmare thing,
	Talking, as he lapped my blood,
	In a voice cruel and flat,
	Saying for ever, “Cat! . . . Cat! . . . Cat! . . .”
	
	That one word was all he said,
	That one word through all my sleep,
	In monotonous mock despair.
	Nonsense may be light as air,
	But there’s Nonsense that can keep
	Horror bristling round the head,
	When a voice cruel and flat
	Says for ever, “Cat! . . . Cat! . . . Cat! . . .”
	
	He had faded, he was gone
	Years ago with Nursery Land,
	When he leapt on me again
	From the clank of a night train,
	Overpowered me foot and head,
	Lapped my blood, while on and on
	The old voice cruel and flat
	Says for ever, “Cat! . . . Cat! . . . Cat! . . .”
	
	Morphia drowsed, again I lay
	In a crater by High Wood:
	He was there with straddling legs,
	Staring eyes as big as eggs,
	Purring as he lapped my blood,
	His black bulk darkening the day,
	With a voice cruel and flat,
	“Cat! . . . Cat! . . . Cat! . . . Cat! . . .” he said, “Cat! . . . Cat! . . .”
	
	When I’m shot through heart and head,
	And there’s no choice but to die,
	The last word I’ll hear, no doubt,
	Won’t be “Charge!” or “Bomb them out!”
	Nor the stretcher-bearer’s cry,
	“Let that body be, he’s dead!”
	But a voice cruel and flat
	Saying for ever, “Cat! . . . Cat! . . . Cat!”


3. A LOVER SINCE CHILDHOOD

	Tangled in thought am I,
	Stumble in speech do I?
	Do I blunder and blush for the reason why?
	Wander aloof do I,
	Lean over gates and sigh,
	Making friends with the bee and the butterfly?
	
	If thus and thus I do,
	Dazed by the thought of you,
	Walking my sorrowful way in the early dew,
	My heart cut through and through
	In this despair of you,
	Starved for a word or a look will my hope renew:
	
	give then a thought for me
	Walking so miserably,
	Wanting relief in the friendship of flower or tree;
	Do but remember, we
	Once could in love agree,
	Swallow your pride, let us be as we used to be.
