1. THE MEDITERRANEAN

	_Quen das finem, rex magne, dolorum?_
	
	Where we went in the boat was a long bay
	a slingshot wide, walled in by towering stone--
	Peaked margin of antiquity’s delay,
	And we went there out of time’s monotone:
	
	Where we went in the black hull no light moved
	But a gull white-winged along the feckless wave,
	The breeze, unseen but fierce as a body loved,
	That boat drove onward like a willing slave:
	
	Where we went in the small ship the seaweed
	Parted and gave to us the murmuring shore
	And we made feast and in our secret need
	Devoured the very plates Aeneas bore:
	
	Where derelict you see through the low twilight
	The green coast that you, thunder-tossed, would win,
	Drop sail, and hastening to drink all night
	Eat dish and bowl--to take that sweet land in!
	
	Where we feasted and caroused on the sandless
	Pebbles, affecting our day of piracy,
	What prophecy of eaten plates could landless
	Wanderers fulfil by the ancient sea?
	
	We for that time might taste the famous age
	Eternal here yet hidden from our eyes
	When lust of power undid its stuffless rage;
	They, in a wineskin, bore earth’s paradise.
	
	Let us lie down once more by the breathing side
	Of Ocean, where our live forefathers sleep
	As if the Known Sea still were a month wide--
	Atlantis howls but is no longer steep!
	
	What country shall we conquer, what fair land
	Unman our conquest and locate our blood?
	We’ve cracked the hemispheres with careless hand!
	Now, from the Gates of Hercules we flood
	
	Westward, westward till the barbarous brine
	Whelms us to the tired land where tasseling corn,
	Fat beans, grapes sweeter than muscadine
	Rot on the vine: in that land were we born.


2. ODE TO THE CONFEDERATE DEAD

	Row after row with strict impunity
	The headstones yield their names to the element,
	The wind whirrs without recollection;
	In the riven troughs the splayed leaves
	Pile up, of nature the casual sacrament
	To the seasonal eternity of death;
	Then driven by the fierce scrutiny
	Of heaven to their election in the vast breath,
	They sough the rumour of mortality.
	
	Autumn is desolation in the plot
	Of a thousand acres where these memories grow
	From the inexhaustible bodies that are not 
	Dead, but feed the grass row after rich row.
	Think of the autumns that have come and gone!--
	Ambitious November with the humors of the year,
	With a particular zeal for every slab,
	Staining the uncomfortable angels that rot
	On the slabs, a wing chipped here, an arm there:
	The brute curiosity of an angel’s stare
	Turns you, like them, to stone,
	Transforms the heaving air
	Till plunged to a heavier world below
	You shift your sea-space blindly
	Heaving, turning like the blind crab.
	
	    _Dazed by the wind, only the wind
	    The leaves flying, plunge_
	
	You know who have waited by the wall
	The twilight certainty of an animal,
	Those midnight restitutions of the blood
	You know--the immitigable pines, the smoky frieze
	Of the sky, the sudden call: you know the rage,
	The cold pool left by the mounting flood,
	Of muted Zeno and Parmenides.
	You who have waited for the angry resolution
	Of those desires that should be yours tomorrow,
	You know the unimportant shrift of death
	And praise the vision
	And praise the arrogant circumstance
	Of those who fall
	Rank upon rank, hurried beyond decision--
	Here by the sagging gate, stopped by the wall. 
	
	    _Seeing, seeing only the leaves
	    Flying, plunge and expire_
	
	Turn your eyes to the immoderate past,
	Turn to the inscrutable infantry rising
	Demons out of the earth they will not last.
	Stonewall, Stonewall, and the sunken fields of hemp,
	Shiloh, Antietam, Malvern Hill, Bull Run.
	Lost in that orient of the thick and fast
	You will curse the setting sun.
	
	    _Cursing only the leaves crying
	    Like an old man in a storm_
	
	You hear the shout, the crazy hemlocks point
	With troubled fingers to the silence which
	Smothers you, a mummy, in time.
	
	                              The hound bitch
	Toothless and dying, in a musty cellar
	Hears the wind only.
	    
	                   Now that the salt of their blood
	Stiffens the saltier oblivion of the sea,
	Seals the malignant purity of the flood,
	What shall we who count our days and bow
	Our heads with a commemorial woe
	In the ribboned coats of grim felicity,
	What shall we say of the bones, unclean,
	Whose verdurous anonymity will grow?
	The ragged arms, the ragged heads and eyes
	Lost in these acres of the insane green?
	The gray lean spiders come, they come and go;
	In a tangle of willows without light
	The singular screech-owl’s tight
	Invisible lyric seeds the mind
	With the furious murmur of their chivalry.
	
	    _We shall say only the leaves
	    Flying, plunge and expire_
	
	We shall say only the leaves whispering
	In the improbable mist of nightfall
	That flies on multiple wing:
	Night is the beginning and the end
	And in between the ends of distraction
	Waits mute speculation, the patient curse
	That stones the eyes, or like the jaguar leaps
	For his own image in a jungle pool, his victim.
	
	What shall we say who have knowledge 
	Carried to the heart?  Shall we take the act
	To the grave?  Shall we, more hopeful, set up the grave
	In the house?  The ravenous grave?
	
	                                  Leave now
	The shut gate and the decomposing wall:
	The gentle serpent, green in the mulberry bush, 
	Riots with his tongue through the hush--
	Sentinel of the grave who counts us all!
