*** Walt Whitman (1819 - 1892)


1. AS I LAY WITH MY HEAD IN YOUR LAP CAMERADO

	As I lay with my head in your lap camerado
	The confession I made I resume what I said to you and the open air
	   I resume
	I know I am restless and make others so
	I know my words are weapons full of danger full of death
	For I confront peace security and all the settled laws to
	   unsettle them
	I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever have
	   been had all accepted me
	I heed not and have never heeded either experience cautions
	   majorities nor ridicule
	And the threat of what is call’d hell is little or nothing to me
	And the lure of what is call’d heaven is little or nothing to me;
	Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me and still
	   urge you without the least idea what is our destination
	Or whether we shall be victorious or utterly quell’d and defeated.


2. COME UP FROM THE FIELDS FATHER

	Come up from the fields father, here’s a letter from our Pete,
	And come to the front door mother, here’s a letter from thy dear son.
	
	Lo, ’tis autumn,
	Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,
	Cool and sweeten Ohio’s villages with leaves fluttering in the moderate wind,
	Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis’d vines,   
	(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?
	Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)
	
	Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and with wondrous clouds,   
	Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers well.
	
	Down in the fields all prospers well,
	But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter’s call,
	And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away.
	
	Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling,
	She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.
	
	Open the envelope quickly,   
	O this is not our son’s writing, yet his name is sign’d,
	O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother’s soul!
	All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main words only,
	Sentences broken, _gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, taken to hospital,
	At present low, but will soon be better._
	
	Ah now the single figure to me,
	Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,
	Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,
	By the jamb of a door leans.
	
	_Grieve not so, dear mother,_ (the just-grown daughter speaks through her sobs,
	The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay’d,)
	_See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better._
	Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be better, that brave and simple soul,)
	While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,
	The only son is dead.
	
	But the mother needs to be better,
	She with thin form presently drest in black,
	By day her meals untouch’d, then at night fitfully sleeping, often waking,
	In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,   
	O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and withdraw,
	To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.


3. I HEAR AMERICA SINGING

	I hear America singing the varied carols I hear
	Those of mechanics each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong
	The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam
	The mason singing his as he makes ready for work or leaves off work
	The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat the deckhand
	   singing on the steamboat deck
	The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench the hatter singing as
	   he stands
	The wood-cutter’s song the ploughboy’s on his way in the morning
	   or at noon intermission or at sundown
	The delicious singing of the mother or of the young wife at work
	   or of the girl sewing or washing
	Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else
	The day what belongs to the day--at night the party of young
	   fellows robust friendly
	Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.


4. O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!

	O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
	The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
	The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
	While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
	                        But O heart! heart! heart!
	                           O the bleeding drops of red,
	                              Where on the deck my Captain lies,
	                                 Fallen cold and dead.
	
	O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
	Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,
	For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,
	For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
	                        Here Captain! dear father!
	                           This arm beneath your head!
	                              It is some dream that on the deck,
	                                You’ve fallen cold and dead.
	
	My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
	My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
	The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
	From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
	                        Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
	                           But I with mournful tread,
	                              Walk the deck my Captain lies,
	                                 Fallen cold and dead.


5. OH ME! OH LIFE!

	Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,
	Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,
	Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)
	Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,
	Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,
	Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,
	The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?
	
	                                      Answer.
	That you are here—that life exists and identity,
	That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.


6. ON THE BEACH AT NIGHT ALONE

	On the beach at night alone,
	As the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song,
	As I watch the bright stars shining, I think a thought of the clef of the universes and of the future.
	
	A vast similitude interlocks all,
	All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,
	All distances of place however wide,
	All distances of time, all inanimate forms,
	All souls, all living bodies though they be ever so different, or in different worlds,
	All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes, the fishes, the brutes,
	All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages,
	All identities that have existed or may exist on this globe, or any globe,
	All lives and deaths, all of the past, present, future,
	This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann’d,
	And shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them.


7. WHEN I HEARD THE LEARN’D ASTRONOMER

	When I heard the learn’d astronomer,
	When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,
	When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,
	When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,
	How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,
	Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,
	In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,
	Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.
