*** Oscar Wilde (1854 - 1900)


1. AT VERONA

	HOW steep the stairs within King’s houses are
	  For exile-wearied feet as mine to tread
	  And O how salt and bitter is the bread
	Which falls from this Hound’s table--better far
	That I had died in the red ways of war
	  Or that the gate of Florence bare my head
	  Than to live thus by all things comraded
	Which seek the essence of my soul to mar.
	
	‘Curse God and die: what better hope than this?
	  He hath forgotten thee in all the bliss
	  Of his gold city and eternal day’--
	Nay peace: behind my prison’s blinded bars
	  I do possess what none can take away
	  My love and all the glory of the stars.


2. CANZONET

	  I HAVE no store
	Of gryphon-guarded gold;
	  Now as before
	Bare is the shepherd’s fold.
	  Rubies nor pearls
	Have I to gem thy throat;
	  Yet woodland girls
	Have loved the shepherd’s note.
	
	  Then pluck a reed
	And bid me sing to thee
	  For I would feed
	Thine ears with melody
	  Who art more fair
	Than fairest fleur-de-lys
	  More sweet and rare
	Than sweetest ambergris.
	
	  What dost thou fear?
	Young Hyacinth is slain
	  Pan is not here
	And will not come again.
	  No horned Faun
	Treads down the yellow leas
	  No God at dawn
	Steals through the olive trees.
	
	  Hylas is dead
	Nor will he e’er divine
	  Those little red
	Rose-petalled lips of thine.
	  On the high hill
	No ivory dryads play
	  Silver and still
	Sinks the sad autumn day.


3. E TENEBRIS

	COME down O Christ and help me! reach Thy hand
	  For I am drowning in a stormier sea
	  Than Simon on Thy lake of Galilee:
	The wine of life is spilt upon the sand
	My heart is as some famine-murdered land
	  Whence all good things have perished utterly
	  And well I know my soul in Hell must lie
	If I this night before God’s throne should stand.
	‘He sleeps perchance or rideth to the chase
	  Like Baal when his prophets howled that name
	  From morn to noon on Carmel’s smitten height.’
	Nay peace I shall behold before the night
	  The feet of brass the robe more white than flame
	  The wounded hands the weary human face.


4. ENDYMION

	THE apple trees are hung with gold
	  And birds are loud in Arcady
	The sheep lie bleating in the fold
	The wild goat runs across the wold
	But yesterday his love he told
	  I know he will come back to me.
	O rising moon!  O Lady moon!
	  Be you my lover’s sentinel
	  You cannot choose but know him well
	For he is shod with purple shoon
	You cannot choose but know my love
	  For he a shepherd’s crook doth bear
	And he is soft as any dove
	  And brown and curly is his hair.
	
	The turtle now has ceased to call
	  Upon her crimson-footed groom
	The grey wolf prowls about the stall
	The lily’s singing seneschal
	Sleeps in the lily-bell and all
	  The violet hills are lost in gloom.
	O risen moon!  O holy moon!
	  Stand on the top of Helice
	  And if my own true love you see
	Ah! if you see the purple shoon
	The hazel crook the lad’s brown hair
	  The goat-skin wrapped about his arm
	Tell him that I am waiting where
	  The rushlight glimmers in the Farm.
	
	The falling dew is cold and chill
	  And no bird sings in Arcady
	The little fauns have left the hill
	Even the tired daffodil
	Has closed its gilded doors and still
	  My lover comes not back to me.
	False moon!  False moon!  O waning moon!
	  Where is my own true lover gone
	  Where are the lips vermilion
	The shepherd’s crook the purple shoon?
	Why spread that silver pavilion
	  Why wear that veil of drifting mist?
	Ah! thou hast young Endymion
	  Thou hast the lips that should be kissed!


5. HÉLAS!

	TO drift with every passion till my soul
	Is a stringed lute on which can winds can play
	Is it for this that I have given away
	Mine ancient wisdom and austere control?
	Methinks my life is a twice-written scroll
	Scrawled over on some boyish holiday
	With idle songs for pipe and virelay
	Which do but mar the secret of the whole.
	Surely there was a time I might have trod
	The sunlit heights and from life’s dissonance
	Struck one clear chord to reach the ears of God:
	Is that time dead? lo! with a little rod
	I did but touch the honey of romance--
	And must I lose a soul’s inheritance?


6. LE JARDIN DES TUILERIES

	THIS winter air is keen and cold
	  And keen and cold this winter sun
	  But round my chair the children run
	Like little things of dancing gold.
	
	Sometimes about the painted kiosk
	  The mimic soldiers strut and stride
	  Sometimes the blue-eyed brigands hide
	In the bleak tangles of the bosk.
	
	And sometimes while the old nurse cons
	  Her book they steal across the square
	  And launch their paper navies where
	Huge Triton writhes in greenish bronze.
	
	And now in mimic flight they flee
	  And now they rush a boisterous band--
	  And tiny hand on tiny hand
	Climb up the black and leafless tree.
	
	Ah! cruel tree! if I were you
	  And children climbed me for their sake
	  Though it be winter I would break
	Into spring blossoms white and blue!


7. LE PANNEAU

	UNDER the rose-tree’s dancing shade
	  There stands a little ivory girl
	  Pulling the leaves of pink and pearl
	With pale green nails of polished jade.
	
	The red leaves fall upon the mould
	  The white leaves flutter one by one
	  Down to a blue bowl where the sun
	Like a great dragon writhes in gold.
	
	The white leaves float upon the air
	  The red leaves flutter idly down
	  Some fall upon her yellow gown
	And some upon her raven hair.
	
	She takes an amber lute and sings
	  And as she sings a silver crane
	  Begins his scarlet neck to strain
	And flap his burnished metal wings.
	
	She takes a lute of amber bright
	  And from the thicket where he lies
	  Her lover with his almond eyes
	Watches her movements in delight.
	
	And now she gives a cry of fear
	  And tiny tears begin to start:
	  A thorn has wounded with its dart
	The pink-veined sea-shell of her ear.
	
	And now she laughs a merry note:
	  There has fallen a petal of the rose
	  Just where the yellow satin shows
	The blue-veined flower of her throat.
	
	With pale green nails of polished jade
	  Pulling the leaves of pink and pearl
	  There stands a little ivory girl
	Under the rose-tree’s dancing shade.


8. THE NEW REMORSE

	THE sin was mine; I did not understand.
	  So now is music prisoned in her cave
	  Save where some ebbing desultory wave
	Frets with its restless whirls this meagre strand.
	And in the withered hollow of this land
	  Hath Summer dug herself so deep a grave
	  That hardly can the leaden willow crave
	One silver blossom from keen Winter’s hand.
	
	But who is this who cometh by the shore?
	(Nay love look up and wonder!)  Who is this
	  Who cometh in dyed garments from the South?
	It is thy new-found Lord and he shall kiss
	  The yet unravished roses of thy mouth
	And I shall weep and worship as before.


9. PAN

	I
	
	O GOAT-FOOT God of Arcady!
	This modern world is grey and old
	And what remains to us of thee?
	
	No more the shepherd lads in glee
	Throw apples at thy wattled fold
	O goat-foot God of Arcady!
	
	Nor through the laurels can one see
	Thy soft brown limbs thy beard of gold
	And what remains to us of thee?
	
	And dull and dead our Thames would be
	For here the winds are chill and cold
	O goat-loot God of Arcady!
	
	Then keep the tomb of Helice
	Thine olive-woods thy vine-clad wold
	And what remains to us of thee?
	
	Though many an unsung elegy
	Sleeps in the reeds our rivers hold
	O goat-foot God of Arcady!
	Ah what remains to us of thee?
	
	II
	
	AH leave the hills of Arcady
	Thy satyrs and their wanton play
	This modern world hath need of thee.
	
	No nymph or Faun indeed have we
	For Faun and nymph are old and grey
	Ah leave the hills of Arcady!
	
	This is the land where liberty
	Lit grave-browed Milton on his way
	This modern world hath need of thee!
	
	A land of ancient chivalry
	Where gentle Sidney saw the day
	Ah leave the hills of Arcady!
	
	This fierce sea-lion of the sea
	This England lacks some stronger lay
	This modern world hath need of thee!
	
	Then blow some trumpet loud and free
	And give thine oaten pipe away
	Ah leave the hills of Arcady!
	This modern world hath need of thee!


10. ROME UNVISITED

	I
	
	THE corn has turned from grey to red
	  Since first my spirit wandered forth
	  From the drear cities of the north
	And to Italia’s mountains fled.
	
	And here I set my face towards home
	  For all my pilgrimage is done
	  Although methinks yon blood-red sun
	Marshals the way to Holy Rome.
	
	O Blessed Lady who dost hold
	  Upon the seven hills thy reign!
	  O Mother without blot or stain
	Crowned with bright crowns of triple gold!
	
	O Roma Roma at thy feet
	  I lay this barren gift of song!
	  For ah! the way is steep and long
	That leads unto thy sacred street.
	
	II
	
	AND yet what joy it were for me
	  To turn my feet unto the south
	  And journeying towards the Tiber mouth
	To kneel again at Fiesole!
	
	And wandering through the tangled pines
	  That break the gold of Arno’s stream
	  To see the purple mist and gleam
	Of morning on the Apennines
	
	By many a vineyard-hidden home
	  Orchard and olive-garden grey
	  Till from the drear Campagna’s way
	The seven hills bear up the dome!
	
	III
	
	A PILGRIM from the northern seas--
	  What joy for me to seek alone
	  The wondrous temple and the throne
	Of him who holds the awful keys!
	
	When bright with purple and with gold
	  Come priest and holy cardinal
	  And borne above the heads of all
	The gentle Shepherd of the Fold.
	
	O joy to see before I die
	  The only God-anointed king
	  And hear the silver trumpets ring
	A triumph as he passes by!
	
	Or at the brazen-pillared shrine
	  Holds high the mystic sacrifice
	  And shows his God to human eyes
	Beneath the veil of bread and wine.
	
	IV
	
	FOR lo what changes time can bring!
	  The cycles of revolving years
	  May free my heart from all its fears
	And teach my lips a song to sing.
	
	Before yon field of trembling gold
	  Is garnered into dusty sheaves
	  Or ere the autumn’s scarlet leaves
	Flutter as birds adown the wold
	
	I may have run the glorious race
	  And caught the torch while yet aflame
	  And called upon the holy name
	Of Him who now doth hide His face.


11. SAN MINIATO

	SEE I have climbed the mountain side
	  Up to this holy house of God
	  Where once that Angel-Painter trod
	Who saw the heavens opened wide
	
	And throned upon the crescent moon
	  The Virginal white Queen of Grace--
	  Mary! could I but see thy face
	Death could not come at all too soon.
	
	O crowned by God with thorns and pain!
	  Mother of Christ!  O mystic wife!
	  My heart is weary of this life
	And over-sad to sing again.
	
	O crowned by God with love and flame!
	  O crowned by Christ the Holy One!
	  O listen ere the searching sun
	Show to the world my sin and shame.
