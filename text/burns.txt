*** Robert Burns (1759 - 1796)


1. AE FOND KISS

	Ae fond kiss, and then we sever; 
	Ae fareweel, and then forever! 
	Deep in heart-wrung tears   I’ll pledge thee, 
	Warring sighs and groans I’ll wage thee. 
	Who shall say that Fortune grieves him, 
	While the star of hope she leaves him? 
	Me, nae cheerfu’ twinkle lights me; 
	Dark despair around benights me. 
	
	I’ll ne’er blame my partial fancy, 
	Naething could resist my Nancy; 
	But to see her was to love her; 
	Love but her, and love forever. 
	Had we never lov’d sae kindly, 
	Had we never lov’d sae blindly, 
	Never met--or never parted-- 
	We had ne’er been broken-hearted. 
	
	Fare thee weel, thou first and fairest! 
	Fare thee weel, thou best and dearest! 
	Thine be ilka joy and treasure, 
	Peace. enjoyment, love, and pleasure! 
	Ae fond kiss, and then we sever; 
	Ae fareweel, alas, forever! 
	Deep in heart-wrung tears   I’ll pledge thee, 
	Warring sighs and groans I’ll wage thee! 



2. AFTON WATER

	Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes, 
	Flow gently, I’ll sing thee a song in thy praise; 
	My Mary’s asleep by thy murmuring stream, 
	Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream. 
	
	Thou stock-dove, whose echo resounds thro’ the glen, 
	Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den, 
	Thou green-crested lapwing, thy screaming forbear, 
	I charge you disturb not my slumbering fair. 
	
	How lofty, sweet Afton, thy neighbouring hills, 
	Far mark’d with the courses of clear winding rills; 
	There daily I wander as noon rises high, 
	My flocks and my Mary’s sweet cot in my eye. 
	
	How pleasant thy banks and green valleys below, 
	Where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow; 
	There oft, as mild Ev’ning sweeps over the lea, 
	The sweet-scented birk shades my Mary and me. 
	
	Thy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides, 
	And winds by the cot where my Mary resides, 
	How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave, 
	As gathering sweet flowrets she stems thy clear wave. 
	
	Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy green braes, 
	Flow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays; 
	My Mary’s asleep by thy murmuring stream, 
	Flow gently, sweet Afton, disturb not her dream. 



3. A DIRGE

	The wintry west extends his blast,
	And hail and rain does blaw;
	Or, the stormy north sends driving forth
	The blinding sleet and snaw:
	While tumbling brown, the burn comes down,
	And roars frae bank to brae;
	And bird and beast in covert rest,
	And pass the heartless day.
	
	The sweeping blast, the sky o’ercast,
	The joyless winter-day,
	Let others fear, to me more dear
	Than all the pride of May:
	The tempest’s howl, it soothes my soul,
	My griefs it seems to join;
	The leafless trees my fancy please,
	Their fate resembles mine!
	
	Thou Pow’r Supreme, whose mighty scheme
	These woes of mine fulfil,
	Here, firm, I rest, they must be best,
	Because they are Thy will!
	Then all I want (O, do Thou grant
	This one request of mine!)
	Since to enjoy Thou dost deny,
	Assist me to resign.



4. FOR A’ THAT AN’ A’ THAT

	Is there, for honest poverty, 
	        That hings his head, an’ a’ that? 
	The coward slave, we pass him by, 
	        We dare be poor for a’ that! 
	               For a’ that, an’ a’ that, 
	                       Our toils obscure, an’ a’ that; 
	               The rank is but the guinea’s stamp; 
	                       The man’s the gowd for a’ that, 
	
	What tho’ on hamely fare we dine, 
	        Wear hoddin-gray, an’ a’ that; 
	Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine, 
	        A man’s a man for a’ that. 
	               For a’ that, an’ a’ that, 
	                       Their tinsel show an’ a’ that; 
	               The honest man, tho’ e’er sae poor, 
	                       Is king o’ men for a’ that. 
	
	Ye see yon birkie, ca’d a lord 
	        Wha struts, an’ stares, an’ a’ that; 
	Tho’ hundreds worship at his word, 
	        He’s but a coof for a’ that: 
	               For a’ that, an’ a’ that, 
	                       His riband, star, an’ a’ that, 
	               The man o’ independent mind, 
	                       He looks and laughs at a’ that. 
	
	A prince can mak a belted knight, 
	        A marquis, duke, an’ a’ that; 
	But an honest man’s aboon his might, 
	        Guid faith he mauna fa’ that! 
	               For a’ that, an’ a’ that, 
	                       Their dignities, an’ a’ that, 
	               The pith o’ sense, an’ pride o’ worth, 
	                       Are higher rank than a’ that. 
	
	Then let us pray that come it may, 
	        As come it will for a’ that, 
	That sense and worth, o’er a’ the earth, 
	        May bear the gree, an’ a’ that. 
	               For a’ that, an’ a’ that, 
	                       It’s coming yet, for a’ that, 
	               That man to man, the warld o’er, 
	                       Shall brothers be for a’ that. 



5. HALLOWEEN

	Upon that night, when fairies light
	On Cassilis Downans dance,
	Or owre the lays, in splendid blaze,
	On sprightly coursers prance;
	Or for Colean the route is ta’en,
	Beneath the moon’s pale beams;
	There, up the cove, to stray and rove,
	Among the rocks and streams
	To sport that night.
	
	Among the bonny winding banks,
	Where Doon rins, wimplin’ clear,
	Where Bruce ance ruled the martial ranks,
	And shook his Carrick spear,
	Some merry, friendly, country-folks,
	Together did convene,
	To burn their nits, and pou their stocks,
	And haud their Halloween
	Fu’ blithe that night.
	
	The lasses feat, and cleanly neat,
	Mair braw than when they’re fine;
	Their faces blithe, fu’ sweetly kythe,
	Hearts leal, and warm, and kin’;
	The lads sae trig, wi’ wooer-babs,
	Weel knotted on their garten,
	Some unco blate, and some wi’ gabs,
	Gar lasses’ hearts gang startin’
	Whiles fast at night.
	
	Then, first and foremost, through the kail,
	Their stocks maun a’ be sought ance;
	They steek their een, and graip and wale,
	For muckle anes and straught anes.
	Poor hav’rel Will fell aff the drift,
	And wander’d through the bow-kail,
	And pou’t, for want o’ better shift,
	A runt was like a sow-tail,
	Sae bow’t that night.
	
	Then, staught or crooked, yird or nane,
	They roar and cry a’ throu’ther;
	The very wee things, todlin’, rin,
	Wi’ stocks out owre their shouther;
	And gif the custoc’s sweet or sour.
	Wi’ joctelegs they taste them;
	Syne cozily, aboon the door,
	Wi cannie care, they’ve placed them
	To lie that night.
	
	The lasses staw frae ‘mang them a’
	To pou their stalks of corn:
	But Rab slips out, and jinks about,
	Behint the muckle thorn:
	He grippet Nelly hard and fast;
	Loud skirl’d a’ the lasses;
	But her tap-pickle maist was lost,
	When kitlin’ in the fause-house
	Wi’ him that night.
	
	The auld guidwife’s well-hoordit nits,
	Are round and round divided,
	And monie lads’ and lasses’ fates
	Are there that night decided:
	Some kindle coothie, side by side,
	And burn thegither trimly;
	Some start awa, wi’ saucy pride,
	And jump out-owre the chimlie
	Fu’ high that night.
	
	Jean slips in twa wi’ tentie ee;
	Wha ‘twas she wadna tell;
	But this is Jock, and this is me,
	She says in to hersel:
	He bleezed owre her, and she owre him,
	As they wad never mair part;
	Till, fuff! he started up the lum,
	And Jean had e’en a sair heart
	To see’t that night.
	
	Poor Willie, wi’ his bow-kail runt,
	Was brunt wi’ primsie Mallie;
	And Mallie, nae doubt, took the drunt,
	To be compared to Willie;
	Mall’s nit lap out wi’ pridefu’ fling,
	And her ain fit it brunt it;
	While Willie lap, and swore by jing,
	‘Twas just the way he wanted
	To be that night.
	
	Nell had the fause-house in her min’,
	She pits hersel and Rob in;
	In loving bleeze they sweetly join,
	Till white in ase they’re sobbin’;
	Nell’s heart was dancin’ at the view,
	She whisper’d Rob to leuk for’t:
	Rob, stowlins, prie’d her bonny mou’,
	Fu’ cozie in the neuk for’t,
	Unseen that night.
	
	But Merran sat behint their backs,
	Her thoughts on Andrew Bell;
	She lea’es them gashin’ at their cracks,
	And slips out by hersel:
	She through the yard the nearest taks,
	And to the kiln goes then,
	And darklins graipit for the bauks,
	And in the blue-clue throws then,
	Right fear’t that night.
	
	And aye she win’t, and aye she swat,
	I wat she made nae jaukin’,
	Till something held within the pat,
	Guid Lord! but she was quakin’!
	But whether ‘was the deil himsel,
	Or whether ‘twas a bauk-en’,
	Or whether it was Andrew Bell,
	She didna wait on talkin’
	To spier that night.
	
	Wee Jennie to her grannie says,
	“Will ye go wi’ me, grannie?
	I’ll eat the apple at the glass
	I gat frae Uncle Johnnie:”
	She fuff’t her pipe wi’ sic a lunt,
	In wrath she was sae vap’rin’,
	She notice’t na, an aizle brunt
	Her braw new worset apron
	Out through that night.
	
	“Ye little skelpie-limmer’s face!
	I daur you try sic sportin’,
	As seek the foul thief ony place,
	For him to spae your fortune.
	Nae doubt but ye may get a sight!
	Great cause ye hae to fear it;
	For mony a ane has gotten a fright,
	And lived and died deleeret
	On sic a night.
	
	“Ae hairst afore the Sherramoor,--
	I mind’t as weel’s yestreen,
	I was a gilpey then, I’m sure
	I wasna past fifteen;
	The simmer had been cauld and wat,
	And stuff was unco green;
	And aye a rantin’ kirn we gat,
	And just on Halloween
	It fell that night.
	
	“Our stibble-rig was Rab M’Graen,
	A clever sturdy fallow:
	His son gat Eppie Sim wi’ wean,
	That lived in Achmacalla:
	He gat hemp-seed, I mind it weel,
	And he made unco light o’t;
	But mony a day was by himsel,
	He was sae sairly frighted
	That very night.”
	
	Then up gat fechtin’ Jamie Fleck,
	And he swore by his conscience,
	That he could saw hemp-seed a peck;
	For it was a’ but nonsense.
	The auld guidman raught down the pock,
	And out a hanfu’ gied him;
	Syne bade him slip frae ‘mang the folk,
	Some time when nae ane see’d him,
	And try’t that night.
	
	He marches through amang the stacks,
	Though he was something sturtin;
	The graip he for a harrow taks.
	And haurls it at his curpin;
	And every now and then he says,
	“Hemp-seed, I saw thee,
	And her that is to be my lass,
	Come after me, and draw thee
	As fast this night.”
	
	He whistled up Lord Lennox’ march
	To keep his courage cheery;
	Although his hair began to arch,
	He was say fley’d and eerie:
	Till presently he hears a squeak,
	And then a grane and gruntle;
	He by his shouther gae a keek,
	And tumbled wi’ a wintle
	Out-owre that night.
	
	He roar’d a horrid murder-shout,
	In dreadfu’ desperation!
	And young and auld came runnin’ out
	To hear the sad narration;
	He swore ‘twas hilchin Jean M’Craw,
	Or crouchie Merran Humphie,
	Till, stop! she trotted through them
	And wha was it but grumphie
	Asteer that night!
	
	Meg fain wad to the barn hae gaen,
	To win three wechts o’ naething;
	But for to meet the deil her lane,
	She pat but little faith in:
	She gies the herd a pickle nits,
	And two red-cheekit apples,
	To watch, while for the barn she sets,
	In hopes to see Tam Kipples
	That very nicht.
	
	She turns the key wi cannie thraw,
	And owre the threshold ventures;
	But first on Sawnie gies a ca’
	Syne bauldly in she enters:
	A ratton rattled up the wa’,
	And she cried, Lord, preserve her!
	And ran through midden-hole and a’,
	And pray’d wi’ zeal and fervour,
	Fu’ fast that night;
	
	They hoy’t out Will wi’ sair advice;
	They hecht him some fine braw ane;
	It chanced the stack he faddom’d thrice
	Was timmer-propt for thrawin’;
	He taks a swirlie, auld moss-oak,
	For some black grousome carlin;
	And loot a winze, and drew a stroke,
	Till skin in blypes cam haurlin’
	Aff’s nieves that night.
	
	A wanton widow Leezie was,
	As canty as a kittlin;
	But, och! that night amang the shaws,
	She got a fearfu’ settlin’!
	She through the whins, and by the cairn,
	And owre the hill gaed scrievin,
	Whare three lairds’ lands met at a burn
	To dip her left sark-sleeve in,
	Was bent that night.
	
	Whyles owre a linn the burnie plays,
	As through the glen it wimpl’t;
	Whyles round a rocky scaur it strays;
	Whyles in a wiel it dimpl’t;
	Whyles glitter’d to the nightly rays,
	Wi’ bickering, dancing dazzle;
	Whyles cookit underneath the braes,
	Below the spreading hazel,
	Unseen that night.
	
	Among the brackens, on the brae,
	Between her and the moon,
	The deil, or else an outler quey,
	Gat up and gae a croon:
	Poor Leezie’s heart maist lap the hool!
	Near lav’rock-height she jumpit;
	but mist a fit, and in the pool
	Out-owre the lugs she plumpit,
	Wi’ a plunge that night.
	
	In order, on the clean hearth-stane,
	The luggies three are ranged,
	And every time great care is ta’en’,
	To see them duly changed:
	Auld Uncle John, wha wedlock joys
	Sin’ Mar’s year did desire,
	Because he gat the toom dish thrice,
	He heaved them on the fire
	In wrath that night.
	
	Wi’ merry sangs, and friendly cracks,
	I wat they didna weary;
	And unco tales, and funny jokes,
	Their sports were cheap and cheery;
	Till butter’d so’ns, wi’ fragrant lunt,
	Set a’ their gabs a-steerin’;
	Syne, wi’ a social glass o’ strunt,
	They parted aff careerin’
	Fu’ blythe that night.



6. HIGHLAND MARY

	Ye banks, and braes, and streams around 
	        The castle o’ Montgomery, 
	Green be your woods, and fair your flowers, 
	        Your waters never drumlie! 
	There Simmer first unfald her robes, 
	        And there the langest tarry: 
	For there I took the last Fareweel 
	        O’ my sweet Highland Mary. 
	
	How sweetly bloom’d the gay, green birk, 
	        How rich the hawthorn’s blossom; 
	As underneath their fragrant shade, 
	        I clasp’d her to my bosom! 
	The golden Hours, on angel wings, 
	        Flew o’er me and my Dearie; 
	For dear to me as light and life 
	        Was my sweet Highland Mary. 
	
	Wi’ mony a vow, and lock’d embrace, 
	        Our parting was fu’ tender; 
	And pledging aft to meet again, 
	        We tore oursels asunder: 
	But Oh! fell Death’s untimely frost, 
	        That nipt my Flower sae early! 
	Now green’s the sod, and cauld’s the clay, 
	        That wraps my Highland Mary! 
	
	O pale, pale now, those rosy lips, 
	        I aft hae kiss’d sae fondly! 
	And clos’d for ay the sparkling glance, 
	        That dwalt on me sae kindly! 
	And mouldering now in silent dust, 
	        That heart that lo’ed me dearly! 
	But still within my bosom’s core 
	        Shall live my Highland Mary.



7. A RED, RED ROSE

	O my Luve is like a red, red rose 
	  That’s newly sprung in June; 
	O my Luve is like the melody 
	  That’s sweetly played in tune. 
	
	So fair art thou, my bonnie lass, 
	  So deep in luve am I; 
	And I will luve thee still, my dear, 
	  Till a’ the seas gang dry. 
	
	Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear, 
	  And the rocks melt wi’ the sun; 
	I will love thee still, my dear, 
	  While the sands o’ life shall run. 
	
	And fare thee weel, my only luve! 
	  And fare thee weel awhile! 
	And I will come again, my luve, 
	  Though it were ten thousand mile.



8. THE SILVER TASSIE

	I
	
	Go, fetch to me a pint o’ wine,
	 And fill it in a silver tassie,
	That I may drink before I go
	 A service to my bonie lassie!
	The boat rocks at the pier o’ Leith,
	 Fu’ loud the wind blaws frae the Ferry,
	The ship rides by the Berwick-Law,
	 And I maun leave my bonie Mary.
	
	
	II
	
	The trumpets sound, the banners fly,
	 The glittering spears are rankèd ready,
	The shouts o’ war are heard afar,
	The battle closes deep and bloody.
	It’s not the roar o’ sea or shore
	 Wad mak me langer wish to tarry,
	Nor shouts o’ war that’s heard afar:
	 It’s leaving thee, my bonie Mary!



9. A WINTER NIGHT

	When biting Boreas, fell and doure, 
	Sharp shivers thro’ the leafless bow’r; 
	When Phoebus gies a short-liv’d glow’r, 
	        Far south the lift, 
	Dim-dark’ning thro’ the flaky show’r, 
	        Or whirling drift: 
	
	Ae night the storm the steeples rocked, 
	Poor Labour sweet in sleep was locked, 
	While burns, wi’ snawy wreeths upchoked, 
	        Wild-eddying swirl, 
	Or thro’ the mining outlet bocked, 
	        Down headlong hurl. 
	
	List’ning, the doors an’ winnocks rattle, 
	I thought me on the ourie cattle, 
	Or silly sheep, wha bide this brattle 
	        O’ winter war, 
	And thro’ the drift, deep-lairing, sprattle, 
	        Beneath a scar. 
	
	Ilk happing bird, wee, helpless thing! 
	That, in the merry months o’ spring, 
	Delighted me to hear thee sing, 
	        What comes o’ thee? 
	Whare wilt thou cow’r thy chittering wing 
	        An’ close thy e’e? 
	
	Ev’n you on murd’ring errands toil’d, 
	Lone from your savage homes exil’d, 
	The blood-stain’d roost, and sheep-cote spoil’d 
	        My heart forgets, 
	While pityless the tempest wild 
	        Sore on you beats.
