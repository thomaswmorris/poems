*** Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809 - 1892)


1. BREAK, BREAK, BREAK

	Break, break, break,
	        On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!
	And I would that my tongue could utter
	        The thoughts that arise in me.
	
	O, well for the fisherman’s boy,
	        That he shouts with his sister at play!
	O, well for the sailor lad,
	        That he sings in his boat on the bay!
	
	And the stately ships go on
	        To their haven under the hill;
	But O for the touch of a vanish’d hand,
	        And the sound of a voice that is still!
	
	Break, break, break
	        At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!
	But the tender grace of a day that is dead
	        Will never come back to me.


2. THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE

	Half a league, half a league,
	Half a league onward,
	All in the valley of Death
	  Rode the six hundred.
	“Forward, the Light Brigade!
	Charge for the guns!” he said.
	Into the valley of Death
	  Rode the six hundred.
	
	“Forward, the Light Brigade!”
	Was there a man dismayed?
	Not though the soldier knew
	  Someone had blundered.
	  Theirs not to make reply,
	  Theirs not to reason why,
	  Theirs but to do and die.
	  Into the valley of Death
	  Rode the six hundred.
	
	Cannon to right of them,
	Cannon to left of them,
	Cannon in front of them
	  Volleyed and thundered;
	Stormed at with shot and shell,
	Boldly they rode and well,
	Into the jaws of Death,
	Into the mouth of hell
	  Rode the six hundred.
	
	Flashed all their sabres bare,
	Flashed as they turned in air
	Sabring the gunners there,
	Charging an army, while
	  All the world wondered.
	Plunged in the battery-smoke
	Right through the line they broke;
	Cossack and Russian
	Reeled from the sabre stroke
	  Shattered and sundered.
	Then they rode back, but not
	  Not the six hundred.
	
	Cannon to right of them,
	Cannon to left of them,
	Cannon behind them
	  Volleyed and thundered;
	Stormed at with shot and shell,
	While horse and hero fell.
	They that had fought so well
	Came through the jaws of Death,
	Back from the mouth of hell,
	All that was left of them,
	  Left of six hundred.
	
	When can their glory fade?
	O the wild charge they made!
	  All the world wondered.
	Honour the charge they made!
	Honour the Light Brigade,
	  Noble six hundred!


3. CROSSING THE BAR

	Sunset and evening star,
	     And one clear call for me!
	And may there be no moaning of the bar,
	     When I put out to sea,
	
	  But such a tide as moving seems asleep,
	     Too full for sound and foam,
	When that which drew from out the boundless deep
	     Turns again home.
	
	  Twilight and evening bell,
	     And after that the dark!
	And may there be no sadness of farewell,
	     When I embark;
	
	  For tho’ from out our bourne of Time and Place
	     The flood may bear me far,
	I hope to see my Pilot face to face
	     When I have crost the bar.


4. THE EAGLE

	He clasps the crag with crooked hands;
	Close to the sun in lonely lands,
	Ring’d with the azure world, he stands.
	
	The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;
	He watches from his mountain walls,
	And like a thunderbolt he falls.


5. LATE, LATE, SO LATE

	Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill!
	Late, late, so late! but we can enter still.
	Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.
	
	No light had we: for that we do repent;
	And learning this, the bridegroom will relent.
	Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.
	
	No light: so late! and dark and chill the night!
	O, let us in, that we may find the light!
	Too late, too late: ye cannot enter now.
	
	Have we not heard the bridegroom is so sweet?
	O, let us in, tho’ late, to kiss his feet!
	No, no, too late! ye cannot enter now.”


6. MARRIAGE MORNING

	Light, so low upon earth, 
	  You send a flash to the sun. 
	Here is the golden close of love, 
	  All my wooing is done. 
	Oh, all the woods and the meadows, 
	  Woods, where we hid from the wet, 
	Stiles where we stayed to be kind, 
	  Meadows in which we met! 
	Light, so low in the vale 
	  You flash and lighten afar, 
	For this is the golden morning of love, 
	  And you are his morning star. 
	Flash, I am coming, I come, 
	  By meadow and stile and wood, 
	Oh, lighten into my eyes and my heart, 
	  Into my heart and my blood! 
	Heart, are you great enough 
	  For a love that never tires? 
	O heart, are you great enough for love? 
	  I have heard of thorns and briers. 
	Over the thorns and briers, 
	  Over the meadows and stiles, 
	Over the world to the end of it 
	  Flash of a million miles. 


7. THE MILLER’S DAUGHTER

	It is the miller’s daughter,
	 And she is grown so dear, so dear,
	That I would be the jewel
	 That trembles in her ear:
	For hid in ringlets day and night,
	I’d touch her neck so warm and white.
	
	And I would be the girdle
	 About her dainty dainty waist,
	And her heart would beat against me,
	 In sorrow and in rest:
	And I should know if it beat right,
	I’d clasp it round so close and tight.
	
	And I would be the necklace,
	 And all day long to fall and rise
	Upon her balmy bosom,
	 With her laughter or her sighs,
	And I would lie so light, so light,
	I scarce should be unclasp’d at night.


8. RING OUT, WILD BELLS

	Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
	The flying cloud, the frosty light:
	The year is dying in the night;
	Ring out, wild bells, and let him die . . .
	
	Ring out false pride in place and blood,
	The civic slander and the spite;
	Ring in the love of truth and right,
	Ring in the common love of good.
	
	Ring out old shapes of foul disease;
	Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
	Ring out the thousand wars of old,
	Ring in the thousand years of peace.
	
	Ring in the valiant man and free,
	The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
	Ring out the darkness of the land,
	Ring in the Christ that is to be.


9. ST. AGNES’ EVE

	Deep on the convent-roof the snows 
	Are sparkling to the moon: 
	My breath to heaven like vapour goes; 
	May my soul follow soon! 
	The shadows of the convent-towers 
	Slant down the snowy sward, 
	Still creeping with the creeping hours 
	That lead me to my Lord: 
	Make Thou my spirit pure and clear 
	As are the frosty skies, 
	Or this first snowdrop of the year 
	That in my bosom lies. 
	
	As these white robes are soil’d and dark, 
	To yonder shining ground; 
	As this pale taper’s earthly spark, 
	To yonder argent round; 
	So shows my soul before the Lamb, 
	My spirit before Thee; 
	So in mine earthly house I am, 
	To that I hope to be. 
	Break up the heavens, O Lord! and far, 
	Thro’ all yon starlight keen, 
	Draw me, thy bride, a glittering star, 
	In raiment white and clean. 
	
	He lifts me to the golden doors; 
	The flashes come and go; 
	All heaven bursts her starry floors, 
	And strows her lights below, 
	And deepens on and up! the gates 
	Roll back, and far within 
	For me the Heavenly Bridegroom waits, 
	To make me pure of sin. 
	The sabbaths of Eternity, 
	One sabbath deep and wide-- 
	A light upon the shining sea-- 
	The Bridegroom with his bride!


10. ULYSSES

	It little profits that an idle king, 
	By this still hearth, among these barren crags, 
	Match’d with an aged wife, I mete and dole 
	Unequal laws unto a savage race, 
	That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me. 
	I cannot rest from travel: I will drink 
	Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy’d 
	Greatly, have suffer’d greatly, both with those 
	That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when 
	Thro’ scudding drifts the rainy Hyades 
	Vext the dim sea: I am become a name; 
	For always roaming with a hungry heart 
	Much have I seen and known; cities of men 
	And manners, climates, councils, governments, 
	Myself not least, but honour’d of them all; 
	And drunk delight of battle with my peers, 
	Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. 
	I am a part of all that I have met; 
	Yet all experience is an arch wherethro’ 
	Gleams that untravell’d world whose margin fades 
	For ever and forever when I move. 
	How dull it is to pause, to make an end, 
	To rust unburnish’d, not to shine in use! 
	As tho’ to breathe were life! Life piled on life 
	Were all too little, and of one to me 
	Little remains: but every hour is saved 
	From that eternal silence, something more, 
	A bringer of new things; and vile it were 
	For some three suns to store and hoard myself, 
	And this gray spirit yearning in desire 
	To follow knowledge like a sinking star, 
	Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. 
	
	        This is my son, mine own Telemachus, 
	To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,--
	Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil 
	This labour, by slow prudence to make mild 
	A rugged people, and thro’ soft degrees 
	Subdue them to the useful and the good. 
	Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere 
	Of common duties, decent not to fail 
	In offices of tenderness, and pay 
	Meet adoration to my household gods, 
	When I am gone. He works his work, I mine. 
	
	        There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail: 
	There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners, 
	Souls that have toil’d, and wrought, and thought with me--
	That ever with a frolic welcome took 
	The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed 
	Free hearts, free foreheads--you and I are old; 
	Old age hath yet his honour and his toil; 
	Death closes all: but something ere the end, 
	Some work of noble note, may yet be done, 
	Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. 
	The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks: 
	The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep 
	Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends, 
	‘T is not too late to seek a newer world. 
	Push off, and sitting well in order smite 
	The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds 
	To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths 
	Of all the western stars, until I die. 
	It may be that the gulfs will wash us down: 
	It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, 
	And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. 
	Tho’ much is taken, much abides; and tho’ 
	We are not now that strength which in old days 
	Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; 
	One equal temper of heroic hearts, 
	Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will 
	To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
