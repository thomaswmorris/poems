*** Charles Lamb (1775 - 1834)


1. ON AN INFANT DYING AS SOON AS BORN

	I saw where in the shroud did lurk
	A curious frame of Nature’s work.
	A flow’ret crushed in the bud,
	A nameless piece of Babyhood,
	Was in a cradle-coffin lying;
	Extinct, with scarce the sense of dying;
	So soon to exchange the imprisoning womb
	For darker closets of the tomb!
	She did but ope an eye, and put
	A clear beam forth, then strait up shut
	For the long dark: ne’er more to see
	Through glasses of mortality.
	Riddle of destiny, who can show
	What thy short visit meant, or know
	What thy errand here below?
	Shall we say, that Nature blind
	Check’d her hand, and changed her mind,
	Just when she had exactly wrought
	A finish’d pattern without fault?
	Could she flag, or could she tire,
	Or lack’d she the Promethean fire
	(With her nine moons’ long workings sicken’d)
	That should thy little limbs have quicken’d?
	Limbs so firm, they seem’d to assure
	Life of health, and days mature:
	Woman’s self in miniature!
	Limbs so fair, they might supply
	(Themselves now but cold imagery)
	The sculptor to make Beauty by.
	Or did the stern-eyed Fate descry,
	That babe, or mother, one must die;
	So in mercy left the stock,
	And cut the branch; to save the shock
	Of young years widow’d; and the pain,
	When Single State comes back again
	To the lone man who, ‘reft of wife,
	Thenceforward drags a maimed life?
	The economy of Heaven is dark;
	And wisest clerks have miss’d the mark,
	Why Human Buds, like this, should fall,
	More brief than fly ephemeral,
	That has his day; while shrivel’d crones
	Stiffen with age to stocks and stones;
	And crabbed use the conscience sears
	In sinners of an hundred years.
	Mother’s prattle, mother’s kiss,
	Baby fond, thou ne’er wilt miss.
	Rites, which custom does impose,
	Silver bells and baby clothes;
	Coral redder than those lips,
	Which pale death did late eclipse;
	Music framed for infants’ glee,
	Whistle never tuned for thee;
	Though thou want’st not, thou shalt have them,
	Loving hearts were they which gave them.
	Let not one be missing; nurse,
	See them laid upon the hearse
	Of infant slain by doom perverse.
	Why should kings and nobles have
	Pictured trophies to their grave;
	And we, churls, to thee deny
	Thy pretty toys with thee to lie,
	A more harmless vanity?



2. A FAREWELL TO TOBACCO

	May the Babylonish curse,
	Strait confound my stammering verse,
	If I can a passage see
	In this word-perplexity,
	Or a fit expression find,
	Or a language to my mind,
	(Still the phrase is wide or scant)
	To take leave of thee, GREAT PLANT!
	Or in any terms relate
	Half my love, or half my hate:
	For I hate, yet love, thee so,
	That, whichever thing I shew,
	The plain truth will seem to be
	A constrained hyperbole,
	And the passion to proceed
	More from a mistress than a weed.
	Sooty retainer to the vine,
	Bacchus’ black servant, negro fine;
	Sorcerer, that mak’st us dote upon
	Thy begrimed complexion,
	And, for thy pernicious sake,
	More and greater oaths to break
	Than reclaimed lovers take
	‘Gainst women: thou thy siege dost lay
	Much too in the female way,
	While thou suck’st the laboring breath
	Faster than kisses or than death.
	Thou in such a cloud dost bind us,
	That our worst foes cannot find us,
	And ill fortune, that would thwart us,
	Shoots at rovers, shooting at us;
	While each man, thro’ thy heightening steam,
	Does like a smoking Etna seem,
	And all about us does express
	(Fancy and wit in richest dress)
	A Sicilian fruitfulness.
	Thou through such a mist dost shew us,
	That our best friends do not know us,
	And, for those allowed features,
	Due to reasonable creatures,
	Liken’st us to fell Chimeras,
	Monsters that, who see us, fear us
	Worse than Cerberus or Geryon,
	Or, who first lov’d a cloud, Ixion.
	Bacchus we know, and we allow
	His tipsy rites. But what art thou,
	That but by reflex can’st shew
	What his deity can do,
	As the false Egyptian spell
	Aped the true Hebrew miracle?
	Some few vapours thou may’st raise,
	The weak brain may serve to amaze,
	But to the reigns and nobler heart
	Can’st nor life nor heat impart.
	Brother of Bacchus, later born,
	The old world was sure forlorn,
	Wanting thee, that aidest more
	The god’s victories than before
	All his panthers, and the brawls
	Of his piping Bacchanals.
	These, as stale, we disallow,
	Or judge of thee meant--only thou
	His true Indian conquest art
	And, for ivy round his dart,
	The reformed god now weaves
	A finer thyrsus of thy leaves.
	Scent to match thy rich perfume
	Chemic art did ne’er presume
	Through her quaint alembic strain,
	None so sov’reign to the brain.
	Nature, that did in thee excel,
	Fram’d again no second smell.
	Roses, violets, but toys
	For the smaller sort of boys,
	Or for greener damsels meant;
	Thou art the only manly scent.
	Stinking’st of the stinking kind,
	Filth of the mouth and fog of the mind,
	Africa, that brags her foyson,
	Breeds no such prodigious poison,
	Henbane, nightshade, both together,
	Hemlock, aconite--
	Nay, rather, Plant divine, of rarest virtue;
	Blisters on the tongue would hurt you.
	‘Twas but in a sort I blam’d thee;
	None e’er prosper’d who defam’d thee;
	Irony all, and feign’d abuse,
	Such as perplext lovers use,
	At a need, when, in despair
	To paint forth their fairest fair,
	Or in part but to express
	That exceeding comeliness
	Which their fancies doth so strike,
	They borrow language of dislike;
	And, instead of Dearest Miss,
	Jewel, Honey, Sweetheart, Bliss,
	And those forms of old admiring,
	Call her Cockatrice and Siren,
	Basilisk, and all that’s evil,
	Witch, Hyena, Mermaid, Devil,
	Ethiop, Wench, and Blackamoor,
	Monkey, Ape, and twenty more;
	Friendly Trait’ress, loving Foe,--
	Not that she is truly so,
	But no other way they know
	A contentment to express,
	Borders so upon excess,
	That they do not rightly wot
	Whether it be pain or not.
	Or, as men, constrained to part
	With what’s nearest to their heart,
	While their sorrow’s at the height,
	Lose discrimination quite,
	And their hasty wrath let fall,
	To appease their frantic gall,
	On the darling thing whatever
	Whence they feel it death to sever,
	Though it be, as they, perforce,
	Guiltless of the sad divorce.
	For I must (nor let it grieve thee,
	Friendliest of plants, that I must) leave the.
	For thy sake, TOBACCO, I
	Would do any thing but die,
	And but seek to extend my days
	Long enough to sing thy praise.
	But, as she, who once hath been
	A king’s consort, is a queen
	Ever after, nor will bate
	Any tittle of her state,
	Though a widow, or divorced,
	So I, from thy converse forced,
	The old name and style retain,
	A right Katherine of Spain;
	And a seat, too, ‘mongst the joys
	Of the blest Tobacco Boys;
	Where, though I, by sour physician,
	Am debarr’d the full fruition
	Of thy favours, I may catch
	Some collateral sweets, and snatch
	Sidelong odours, that give life
	Like glances from a neighbour’s wife;
	And still live in the by-places
	And the suburbs of thy graces;
	And in thy borders take delight,
	An unconquer’d Canaanite.



3. THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES

	Where are they gone, the old familiar faces?
	I had a mother, but she died, and left me,
	Died prematurely in a day of horrors--
	All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.
	
	I have had playmates, I have had companions,
	In my days of childhood, in my joyful school days--
	All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.
	
	I have been laughing, I have been carousing,
	Drinking late, sitting late, with my bosom cronies--
	All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.
	
	I lov’d a love once, fairest among women;
	Clos’d are her doors on me, I must not see her--
	All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.
	
	I have a friend, a kinder friend has no man.
	Like an ingrate, I left my friend abruptly;
	Left him, to muse on the old familiar faces.
	
	Ghost-like, I pac’d round the haunts of my childhood.
	Earth seem’d a desert I was bound to traverse,
	Seeking to find the old familiar faces.
	
	Friend of my bosom, thou more than a brother!
	Why were not thou born in my father’s dwelling?
	So might we talk of the old familiar faces.
	
	For some they have died, and some they have left me,
	_And some are taken from me_; all are departed;
	All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.



4. THOUGHTLESS CRUELTY

	There, Robert, you have kill’d that fly--,
	And should you thousand ages try
	The life you’ve taken to supply,
	You could not do it.
	
	You surely must have been devoid
	Of thought and sense, to have destroy’d
	A thing which no way you annoy’d--
	You’ll one day rue it.
	
	Twas but a fly perhaps you’ll say,
	That’s born in April, dies in May;
	That does but just learn to display
	His wings one minute,
	
	And in the next is vanish’d quite.
	A bird devours it in his flight--
	Or come a cold blast in the night,
	There’s no breath in it.
	
	The bird but seeks his proper food--
	And Providence, whose power endu’d
	That fly with life, when it thinks good,
	May justly take it.
	
	But you have no excuses for’t--
	A life by Nature made so short,
	Less reason is that you for sport
	Should shorter make it.
	
	A fly a little thing you rate--
	But, Robert do not estimate
	A creature’s pain by small or great;
	The greatest being
	
	Can have but fibres, nerves, and flesh,
	And these the smallest ones possess,
	Although their frame and structure less
	Escape our seeing.
