*** Andrew Marvell (1621 - 1678)


1. BERMUDAS

	Where the remote Bermudas ride
	In th’ Oceans bosome unespy’d,
	From a small Boat, that row’d along,
	The listning Winds receiv’d this Song.
	What should we do but sing his Praise
	That led us through the watry Maze,
	Unto an Isle so long unknown,
	And yet far kinder than our own?
	Where he the huge Sea-Monsters wracks,
	That lift the Deep upon their Backs.
	He lands us on a grassy stage;
	Safe from the Storms, and Prelat’s rage.
	He gave us this eternal Spring,
	Which here enamells every thing;
	And sends the Fowl’s to us in care,
	On daily Visits through the Air,
	He hangs in shades the Orange bright,
	Like golden Lamps in a green Night.
	And does in the Pomgranates close,
	Jewels more rich than Ormus show’s.
	He makes the Figs our mouths to meet;
	And throws the Melons at our feet.
	But Apples plants of such a price,
	No Tree could ever bear them twice.
	With Cedars, chosen by his hand,
	From Lebanon, he stores the Land.
	And makes the hollow Seas, that roar,
	Proclaime the Ambergris on shoar.
	He cast (of which we rather boast)
	The Gospels Pearl upon our coast.
	And in these Rocks for us did frame
	A Temple, where to sound his Name.
	Oh let our Voice his Praise exalt,
	Till it arrive at Heavens Vault:
	Which thence (perhaps) rebounding, may
	Eccho beyond the Mexique Bay.
	Thus sung they, in the English boat,
	An holy and a chearful Note,
	And all the way, to guide their Chime,
	With falling Oars they kept the time.


2. THE CORONET

	When for the Thorns with which I long, too long,
	With many a piercing wound,
	My Saviours head have crown’d,
	I seek with Garlands to redress that Wrong:
	Through every Garden, every Mead,
	I gather flow’rs (my fruits are only flow’rs)
	Dismantling all the fragrant Towers
	That once adorn’d my Shepherdesses head.
	And now when I have summ’d up all my store,
	Thinking (so I my self deceive)
	So rich a Chaplet thence to weave
	As never yet the king of Glory wore:
	Alas I find the Serpent old
	That, twining in his speckled breast,
	About the flow’rs disguis’d does fold,
	With wreaths of Fame and Interest.
	Ah, foolish Man, that would’st debase with them,
	And mortal Glory, Heavens Diadem!
	But thou who only could’st the Serpent tame,
	Either his slipp’ry knots at once untie,
	And disintangle all his winding Snare:
	Or shatter too with him my curious frame:
	And let these wither, so that he may die,
	Though set with Skill and chosen out with Care.
	That they, while Thou on both their Spoils dost tread,
	May crown thy Feet, that could not crown thy Head.


3. THE DEFINITION OF LOVE

	My Love is of a birth as rare
	As ‘tis for object strange and high:
	It was begotten by despair
	Upon Impossibility.
	
	Magnanimous Despair alone.
	Could show me so divine a thing,
	Where feeble Hope could ne’r have flown
	But vainly flapt its Tinsel Wing.
	
	And yet I quickly might arrive
	Where my extended Soul is fixt,
	But Fate does Iron wedges drive,
	And alwaies crouds it self betwixt.
	
	For Fate with jealous Eye does see.
	Two perfect Loves; nor lets them close:
	Their union would her ruine be,
	And her Tyrannick pow’r depose.
	
	And therefore her Decrees of Steel
	Us as the distant Poles have plac’d,
	(Though Loves whole World on us doth wheel)
	Not by themselves to be embrac’d.
	
	Unless the giddy Heaven fall,
	And Earth some new Convulsion tear;
	And, us to joyn, the World should all
	Be cramp’d into a Planisphere.
	
	As Lines so Loves Oblique may well
	Themselves in every Angle greet:
	But ours so truly Paralel,
	Though infinite can never meet.
	
	Therefore the Love which us doth bind,
	But Fate so enviously debarrs,
	Is the Conjunction of the Mind,
	And Opposition of the Stars.


4. A DIALOGUE BETWEEN SOUL AND BODY

	_Soul:_
	
	O Who shall, from this Dungeon, raise
	A Soul inslav’d so many wayes?
	With bolts of Bones, that fetter’d stands
	In Feet ; and manacled in Hands.
	Here blinded with an Eye ; and there
	Deaf with the drumming of an Ear.
	A Soul hung up, as ‘twere, in Chains
	Of Nerves, and Arteries, and Veins.
	Tortur’d, besides each other part,
	
	In a vain Head, and double Heart.
	
	
	_Body:_
	
	O who shall me deliver whole,
	From bonds of this Tyrannic Soul?
	Which, stretcht upright, impales me so,
	That mine own Precipice I go;
	And warms and moves this needless Frame:
	(A Fever could but do the same.)
	And, wanting where its spight to try,
	Has made me live to let me dye.
	A Body that could never rest,
	Since this ill Spirit it possest.
	
	
	_Soul:_
	
	What Magic could me thus confine
	Within anothers Grief to pine?
	Where whatsoever it complain,
	I feel, that cannot feel, the pain.
	And all my Care its self employes,
	That to preserve, which me destroys:
	Constrain’d not only to indure
	Diseases, but, whats worse, the Cure:
	And ready oft the Port to gain,
	Am Shipwrackt into Health again.
	
	
	_Body:_
	
	But Physick yet could never reach
	The Maladies Thou me dost teach;
	Whom first the Cramp of Hope does Tear:
	And then the Palsie Shakes of Fear.
	The Pestilence of Love does heat :
	Or Hatred’s hidden Ulcer eat.
	Joy’s chearful Madness does perplex:
	Or Sorrow’s other Madness vex.
	Which Knowledge forces me to know;
	And Memory will not foregoe.
	What but a Soul could have the wit
	To build me up for Sin so fit?
	So Architects do square and hew,
	Green Trees that in the Forest grew.


5. A DIALOGUE BETWEEN SOUL AND PLEASURE

	_Soul:_
	
	Courage my Soul, now learn to wield
	The weight of thine immortal Shield.
	Close on thy Head thy Helmet bright.
	Ballance thy Sword against the Fight.
	See where an Army, strong as fair,
	With silken Banners spreads the air.
	Now, if thou bee’st that thing Divine,
	In this day’s Combat let it shine:
	And shew that Nature wants an Art
	To conquer one resolved Heart.
	
	
	_Pleasure:_
	
	Welcome the Creations Guest,
	Lord of Earth, and Heavens Heir.
	Lay aside that Warlike Crest,
	And of Nature’s banquet share:
	Where the Souls of fruits and flow’rs
	Stand prepar’d to heighten yours.
	
	
	_Soul:_
	
	I sup above, and cannot stay
	To bait so long upon the way.
	
	
	_Pleasure:_
	
	On these downy Pillows lye,
	Whose soft Plumes will thither fly:
	On these Roses strow’d so plain
	Lest one Leaf thy Side should strain.
	
	
	_Soul:_
	
	My gentler Rest is on a Thought,
	Conscious of doing what I ought.
	
	
	_Pleasure:_
	
	If thou bee’st with Perfumes pleas’d,
	Such as oft the Gods appeas’d,
	Thou in fragrant Clouds shalt show
	Like another God below.
	
	
	_Soul:_
	
	A Soul that knowes not to presume
	Is Heaven’s and its own perfume.
	
	
	_Pleasure:_
	
	Every thing does seem to vie
	Which should first attract thine Eye:
	But since none deserves that grace,
	In this Crystal view thy face.
	
	
	_Soul:_
	
	When the Creator’s skill is priz’d,
	The rest is all but Earth disguis’d.
	
	
	_Pleasure:_
	
	Heark how Musick then prepares
	For thy Stay these charming Aires ;
	Which the posting Winds recall,
	And suspend the Rivers Fall.
	
	
	_Soul:_
	
	Had I but any time to lose,
	On this I would it all dispose.
	Cease Tempter. None can chain a mind
	Whom this sweet Chordage cannot bind.
	
	
	_Chorus:_
	
	Earth cannot shew so brave a Sight
	As when a single Soul does fence
	The Batteries of alluring Sense,
	And Heaven views it with delight.
	Then persevere: for still new Charges sound:
	And if thou overcom’st thou shalt be crown’d.
	
	
	_Pleasure:_
	
	All this fair, and cost, and sweet,
	Which scatteringly doth shine,
	Shall within one Beauty meet,
	And she be only thine.
	
	
	_Soul:_
	
	If things of Sight such Heavens be,
	What Heavens are those we cannot see?
	
	
	_Pleasure:_
	
	Where so e’re thy Foot shall go
	The minted Gold shall lie;
	Till thou purchase all below,
	And want new Worlds to buy.
	
	
	_Soul_:
	
	Wer’t not a price who ‘ld value Gold?
	And that’s worth nought that can be sold.
	
	
	_Pleasure:_
	
	Wilt thou all the Glory have
	That War or Peace commend?
	Half the World shall be thy Slave
	The other half thy Friend.
	
	
	_Soul:_
	
	What Friends, if to my self untrue?
	What Slaves, unless I captive you?
	
	
	_Pleasure:_
	
	Thou shalt know each hidden Cause;
	And see the future Time:
	Try what depth the Centre draws;
	And then to Heaven climb.
	
	
	_Soul:_
	
	None thither mounts by the degree
	Of Knowledge, but Humility.
	
	
	_Chorus_
	
	Triumph, triumph, victorious Soul;
	The World has not one Pleasure more:
	The rest does lie beyond the pole,
	And is thine everlasting Store.


6. EYES AND TEARS

	How wisely Nature did decree,
	With the same Eyes to weep and see!
	That, having view’d the object vain,
	They might be ready to complain.
	
	And since the Self-deluding Sight,
	In a false Angle takes each hight;
	These Tears which better measure all,
	Like wat’ry Lines and Plummets fall.
	
	Two Tears, which Sorrow long did weigh
	Within the Scales of either Eye,
	And then paid out in equal Poise,
	Are the true price of all my Joyes.
	
	What in the World most fair appears,
	Yea even Laughter, turns to Tears:
	And all the Jewels which we prize,
	Melt in these Pendants of the Eyes.
	
	I have through every Garden been,
	Amongst the Red, the White, the Green;
	And yet, from all the flow’rs I saw,
	No Hony, but these Tears could draw.
	
	So the all-seeing Sun each day
	Distills the World with Chymick Ray;
	But finds the Essence only Showers,
	Which straight in pity back he powers.
	
	Yet happy they whom Grief doth bless,
	That weep the more, and see the less:
	And, to preserve their Sight more true,
	Bath still their Eyes in their own Dew.
	
	So Magdalen, in Tears more wise
	Dissolv’d those captivating Eyes,
	Whose liquid Chains could flowing meet
	To fetter her Redeemers feet.
	
	Not full sailes hasting loaden home,
	Nor the chast Ladies pregnant Womb,
	Nor Cynthia Teeming show’s so fair,
	As two Eyes swoln with weeping are.
	
	The sparkling Glance that shoots Desire,
	Drench’d in these Waves, does lose it fire.
	Yea oft the Thund’rer pitty takes
	And here the hissing Lightning slakes.
	
	The Incense was to Heaven dear,
	Not as a Perfume, but a Tear.
	And Stars shew lovely in the Night,
	But as they seem the Tears of Light.
	
	Ope then mine Eyes your double Sluice,
	And practise so your noblest Use.
	For others too can see, or sleep;
	But only humane Eyes can weep.
	
	Now like two Clouds dissolving, drop,
	And at each Tear in distance stop:
	Now like two Fountains trickle down:
	Now like two floods o’return and drown.
	
	Thus let your Streams o’reflow your Springs,
	Till Eyes and Tears be the same things:
	And each the other’s difference bears;
	These weeping Eyes, those seeing Tears.


7. THE GARDEN

	How vainly men themselves amaze
	To win the Palm, the Oke, or Bayes;
	And their uncessant Labours see
	Crown’d from some single Herb or Tree,
	Whose short and narrow verged Shade
	Does prudently their Toyles upbraid;
	While all Flow’rs and all Trees do close
	To weave the Garlands of repose.
	Fair quiet, have I found thee here,
	And Innocence thy Sister dear!
	Mistaken long, I sought you then
	In busie Companies of Men.
	Your sacred Plants, if here below,
	Only among the Plants will grow.
	Society is all but rude,
	To this delicious Solitude.
	No white nor red was ever seen
	So am’rous as this lovely green.
	Fond Lovers, cruel as their Flame,
	Cut in these Trees their Mistress name.
	Little, Alas, they know, or heed,
	How far these Beauties Hers exceed!
	Fair Trees! where s’eer your barkes I wound,
	No Name shall but your own be found.
	When we have run our Passions heat,
	Love hither makes his best retreat.
	The Gods, that mortal Beauty chase,
	Still in a Tree did end their race.
	Apollo hunted Daphne so,
	Only that She might Laurel grow.
	And Pan did after Syrinx speed,
	Not as a Nymph, but for a Reed.
	What wond’rous Life in this I lead!
	Ripe Apples drop about my head;
	The Luscious Clusters of the Vine
	Upon my Mouth do crush their Wine;
	The Nectaren, and curious Peach,
	Into my hands themselves do reach;
	Stumbling on Melons, as I pass,
	Insnar’d with Flow’rs, I fall on Grass.
	Mean while the Mind, from pleasure less,
	Withdraws into its happiness:
	The Mind, that Ocean where each kind
	Does streight its own resemblance find;
	Yet it creates, transcending these,
	Far other Worlds, and other Seas;
	Annihilating all that’s made
	To a green Thought in a green Shade.
	Here at the Fountains sliding foot,
	Or at some Fruit-trees mossy root,
	Casting the Bodies Vest aside,
	My Soul into the boughs does glide:
	There like a Bird it sits, and sings,
	Then whets, and combs its silver Wings;
	And, till prepar’d for longer flight,
	Waves in its Plumes the various Light.
	Such was that happy Garden-state,
	While Man there walk’d without a Mate:
	After a Place so pure, and sweet,
	What other Help could yet be meet!
	But ‘twas beyond a Mortal’s share
	To wander solitary there:
	Two Paradises ‘twere in one
	To live in Paradise alone.
	How well the skilful Gardner drew
	Of flow’rs and herbes this Dial new;
	Where from above the milder Sun
	Does through a fragrant Zodiack run;
	And, as it works, th’ industrious Bee
	Computes its time as well as we.
	How could such sweet and wholsome Hours
	Be reckon’d but with herbs and flow’rs!


8. AN HORATIAN ODE

	The forward Youth that would appear
	Must now forsake his Muses dear,
	Nor in the Shadows sing
	His Numbers languishing.
	‘Tis time to leave the Books in dust,
	And oyl th’unused Armours rust:
	Removing from the Wall
	The Corslet of the Hall.
	So restless Cromwell could not cease
	In the inglorious Arts of Peace,
	But through adventrous War
	Urged his active Star.
	And, like the three-fork’d Lightning, first
	Breaking the Clouds where it was nurst,
	Did through his own Side
	His fiery way divide.
	For ‘tis all one to Courage high
	The Emulous or Enemy;
	And with such to inclose
	Is more then to oppose.
	Then burning through the Air he went,
	And Pallaces and Temples rent:
	And Caesars head at last
	Did through his Laurels blast.
	‘Tis Madness to resist or blame
	The force of angry Heavens flame:
	And, if we would speak true,
	Much to the Man is due.
	Who, from his private Gardens, where
	He liv’d reserved and austere,
	As if his hightest plot
	To plant the Bergamot,
	Could by industrious Valour climbe
	To ruine the great Work of Time,
	And cast the Kingdome old
	Into another Mold.
	Though Justice against Fate complain,
	And plead the antient Rights in vain:
	But those do hold or break
	As Men are strong or weak.
	Nature that hateth emptiness,
	Allows of penetration less:
	And therefore must make room.
	Where greater Spirits come.
	What Field of all the Civil Wars,
	Where his were not the deepest Scars?
	And Hampton shows what part
	He had of wiser Art.
	Where, twining subtile fears with hope,
	He wove a Net of such a scope,
	That Charles himself might chase
	To Caresbrooks narrow case.
	That thence the Royal Actor born
	The Tragick Scaffold might adorn
	While round the armed Bands
	Did clap their bloody hands.
	He nothing common did or mean
	Upon that memorable Scene:
	But with his keener Eye
	The Axes edge did try:
	Nor call’d the Gods with vulgar spight
	To vindicate his helpless Right,
	But bow’d his comely Head,
	Down as upon a Bed.
	This was that memorable Hour
	Which first assur’d the forced Pow’r.
	So when they did design
	The Capitols first Line,
	A bleeding Head where they begun,
	Did fright the Architects to run;
	And yet in that the State
	Foresaw it’s happy Fate.
	And now the Irish are asham’d
	To see themselves in one Year tam’d:
	So much one Man can do,
	That does both act and know.
	They can affirm his Praises best,
	And Have, though overcome, confest
	How good he is, how just,
	And fit for highest Trust:
	Nor yet grown stiffer with Command,
	But still in the Republick’s hand:
	How fit he is to sway
	That can so well obey.
	He to the Common Feet presents
	A Kingdome, for his first years rents:
	And, what he may, forbears
	His Fame to make it theirs:
	And has his Sword and Spoyls ungirt,
	To lay them at the Publick’s skirt.
	So when the Falcon high
	Falls heavy from the Sky,
	She, having kill’d no more does search,
	But on the next green Bow to pearch;
	Where, when he first does lure,
	The Falckner has her sure.
	What may not then our Isle presume
	While Victory his Crest does plume!
	What may not others fear
	If thus he crown each Year!
	A Caesar he ere long to Gaul,
	To Italy an Hannibal,
	And to all States not free
	Shall Clymacterick be.
	The Pict no shelter now shall find
	Within his party-colour’d Mind;
	But from this Valour sad
	Shrink underneath the Plad:
	Happy if in the tufted brake
	The English Hunter him mistake;
	Nor lay his Hounds in near
	The Caledonian Deer.
	But thou the Wars and Fortunes Son
	March indefatigably on;
	And for the last effect
	Still keep thy Sword erect:
	Besides the Force it has to fright
	The Spirits of the shady Night,
	The same Arts that did gain
	A Pow’r must it maintain.


9. TO HIS COY MISTRESS

	Had we but World enough, and Time,
	This coyness Lady were no crime.
	We would sit down, and think which way
	To walk, and pass our long Loves Day.
	Thou by the Indian Ganges side.
	Should’st Rubies find: I by the Tide
	Of Humber would complain. I would
	Love you ten years before the Flood:
	And you should if you please refuse
	Till the Conversion of the Jews.
	My vegetable Love should grow
	Vaster then Empires, and more slow.
	An hundred years should go to praise
	Thine Eyes, and on thy Forehead Gaze.
	Two hundred to adore each Breast.
	But thirty thousand to the rest.
	An Age at least to every part,
	And the last Age should show your Heart.
	For Lady you deserve this State;
	Nor would I love at lower rate.
	But at my back I alwaies hear
	Times winged Charriot hurrying near:
	And yonder all before us lye
	Desarts of vast Eternity.
	Thy Beauty shall no more be found;
	Nor, in thy marble Vault, shall sound
	My ecchoing Song: then Worms shall try
	That long preserv’d Virginity:
	And your quaint Honour turn to durst;
	And into ashes all my Lust.
	The Grave’s a fine and private place,
	But none I think do there embrace.
	Now therefore, while the youthful hew
	Sits on thy skin like morning glew,
	And while thy willing Soul transpires
	At every pore with instant Fires,
	Now let us sport us while we may;
	And now, like am’rous birds of prey,
	Rather at once our Time devour,
	Than languish in his slow-chapt pow’r.
	Let us roll all our Strength, and all
	Our sweetness, up into one Ball:
	And tear our Pleasures with rough strife,
	Thorough the Iron gates of Life.
	Thus, though we cannot make our Sun
	Stand still, yet we will make him run.


10. YOUNG LOVE

	Come little Infant, Love me now,
	While thine unsuspected years
	Clear thine aged Fathers brow
	From cold Jealousie and Fears.
	
	Pretty surely ‘twere to see
	By young Love old Time beguil’d:
	While our Sportings are as free
	As the Nurses with the Child.
	
	Common Beauties stay fifteen;
	Such as yours should swifter move;
	Whole fair Blossoms are too green
	Yet for lust, but not for Love.
	
	Love as much the snowy Lamb
	Or the wanton Kid does prize,
	As the lusty Bull or Ram,
	For his morning Sacrifice.
	
	Now then love me: time may take
	Thee before thy time away:
	Of this Need wee’l Virtue make,
	And learn Love before we may.
	
	So we win of doubtful Fate;
	And, if good she to us meant,
	We that Good shall antedate,
	Or, if ill, that Ill prevent.
	
	Thus as Kingdomes, frustrating
	Other Titles to their Crown,
	In the craddle crown their King,
	So all Forraign Claims to drown.
	
	So, to make all Rivals vain,
	Now I crown thee with my Love:
	Crown me with thy Love again,
	And we both shall Monarchs prove.
