*** James Joyce (1882 - 1941)


1. ALONE

	The moon’s soft golden meshes make
	All night a veil;
	The shore-lamps in the sleeping lake
	Laburnum tendrils trail.
	
	The sly reeds whisper in the night
	A name--her name,
	And all my soul is a delight,
	A swoon or shame


2. FLOOD

	Gold-brown upon the sated flood
	The rock-vine clusters lift and sway:
	Vast wings above the lambent waters brood
	Of sullen day.
	
	A waste of waters ruthlessly
	Sways and uplifts its weedy mane,
	Where brooding day stares down upon the sea
	In dull disdain.
	
	Uplift and sway, O golden vine,
	Thy clustered fruits to love’s full flood,
	Lambent and vast and ruthless as is thine
	Incertitude.


3. NIGHT PIECE

	Gaunt in gloom
	The pale stars their torches,
	Enshrouded, wave.
	Ghost-fires from heaven’s far verges faint illume--
	Arches on soaring arches--
	Night’s sin-dark nave.
	
	Seraphim
	The lost hosts awaken
	To service, till
	In moonless gloom each lapses, muted, dim,
	Raised when she has and shaken
	Her thurible.
	
	And long and loud
	To night’s nave upsoaring,
	A star-knell tolls
	As the bleak incense surges, cloud on cloud,
	Voidward from the adoring
	Waste of souls.


4. TUTTO È SCIOLTO

	A birdless heaven, sea-dusk and a star 
	Sad in the west; 
	And thou, poor heart, love’s image, fond and far, 
	Rememberest: 
	
	Her silent eyes and her soft foam-white brow 
	And fragrant hair, 
	Falling as in the silence falleth now 
	Dusk from the air. 
	
	Ah, why wilt thou remember these, or why, 
	Poor heart, repine, 
	If the sweet love she yielded with a sigh 
	Was never thine?
