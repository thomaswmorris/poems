*** Anthony Hecht (1923 - 2004)


1. AFTER THE RAIN

	The barbed-wire fences rust
	As their cedar uprights blacken
	After a night of rain.
	Some early, innocent lust
	Gets me outdoors to smell
	The teasle, the pelted bracken,
	The cold, mossed-over well,
	Rank with its iron chain,
	And takes me off for a stroll.
	Wetness has taken over.
	From drain and creeper twine
	It’s runnelled and trenched and edged
	A pebbled serpentine
	Secretly, as though pledged
	To attain a difficult goal
	And join some important river.
	The air is a smear of ashes
	With a cool taste of coins.
	Stiff among misty washes,
	The trees are as black as wicks,
	Silent, detached and old.
	A pallor undermines
	Some damp and swollen sticks.
	The woods are rich with mould.
	How even and pure this light!
	All things stand on their own,
	Equal and shadowless,
	In a world gone pale and neuter,
	Yet riddled with fresh delight.
	The heart of every stone
	Conceals a toad, and the grass
	Shines with a douse of pewter.
	Somewhere a branch rustles
	With the life of squirrels or birds,
	Some life that is quick and right.
	This queer, delicious bareness,
	This plain, uniform light,
	In which both elms and thistles,
	Grass, boulders, even words,
	Speak for a Spartan fairness,
	Might, as I think it over,
	Speak in a form of signs,
	If only one could know
	All of its hidden tricks,
	Saying that I must go
	With a cool taste of coins
	To join some important river,
	Some damp and swollen Styx.
	Yet what puzzles me the most
	Is my unwavering taste
	For these dim, weathery ghosts,
	And how, from the very first,
	An early, innocent lust
	Delighted in such wastes,
	Sought with a reckless thirst
	A light so pure and just.


2. APPLICATION FOR A GRANT

	Noble executors of the munificent testament
	Of the late John Simon Guggenheim, distinguished bunch
	Of benefactors, there are certain kinds of men
	Who set their hearts on being bartenders,
	For whom a life upon duck-boards, among fifths,
	Tapped kegs and lemon twists, crowded with lushes
	Who can master neither their bladders nor consonants,
	Is the only life, greatly to be desired.
	There’s the man who yearns for the White House, there to compose
	Rhythmical lists of enemies, while someone else
	Wants to be known to the Tour d’Argent’s head waiter.
	As the Sibyl of Cumae said: It takes all kinds.
	Nothing could bribe your Timon, your charter member
	Of the Fraternal Order of Grizzly Bears to love
	His fellow, whereas it’s just the opposite
	With interior decorators; that’s what makes horse races.
	One man may have a sharp nose for tax shelters,
	Screwing the IRS with mirth and profit;
	Another devote himself to his shell collection,
	Deaf to his offspring, indifferent to the feast
	With which his wife hopes to attract his notice.
	Some at the Health Club sweating under bar bells
	Labor away like grunting troglodytes,
	Smelly and thick and inarticulate,
	Their brains squeezed out through their pores by sheer exertion.
	As for me, the prize for poets, the simple gift
	For amphybrachs strewn by a kind Euterpe,
	With perhaps a laurel crown of the evergreen
	Imperishable of your fine endowment
	Would supply my modest wants, who dream of nothing
	But a pad on Eighth Street and your approbation.


3. BIRDWATCHERS OF AMERICA

	It’s all very well to dream of a dove that saves,
	Picasso’s or the Pope’s,
	The one that annually coos in Our Lady’s ear
	Half the world’s hopes,
	And the other one that shall cunningly engineer
	The retirement of all businessmen to their graves,
	And when this is brought about
	Make us the loving brothers of every lout-
	But in our part of the country a false dusk
	Lingers for hours; it steams
	From the soaked hay, wades in the cloudy woods,
	Engendering other dreams.
	Formless and soft beyond the fence it broods
	Or rises as a faint and rotten musk
	Out of a broken stalk.
	There are some things of which we seldom talk;
	For instance, the woman next door, whom we hear at night,
	Claims that when she was small
	She found a man stone dead near the cedar trees
	After the first snowfall.
	The air was clear. He seemed in ultimate peace
	Except that he had no eyes. Rigid and bright
	Upon the forehead, furred
	With a light frost, crouched an outrageous bird.


4. ECLOGUE OF THE SHEPHERD AND THE TOWNIE

	_Shepherd:_
	
	Not the blue-fountained Florida hotel,
	Bell-capped, bellevued, straight-jacketed and decked
	With chromium palms and a fromage of moon,
	Not goodnight chocolates, nor the soothing slide
	Of huîtres and sentinel straight-up martinis,
	Neither the yacht heraldic nor the stretch
	Limos and pants, Swiss banks or Alpine stocks
	Shall solace you, or quiet the long pain
	Of cold ancestral disinheritance,
	Severing your friendly commerce with the beasts,
	Gone, lapsed, and cancelled, rendered obsolete
	As the gonfalon of Bessarabia,
	The shawm, the jitney, the equestrian order,
	The dark daguerreotypes of Paradise.
	
	
	_Townie:_
	
	No humble folding cot, no steaming sty
	Or sheep-dipped meadow now shall dignify
	Your brute and sordid commerce with the beasts,
	Scotch your flea-bitten bitterness or down
	The voice that keeps repeating, “Up your Ars
	Poetica, your earliest diapered dream
	Of the long-gone Odd Fellows amity
	Of bunny and scorpion, the entente cordiale
	Of lamb and lion, the old nursery fraud
	And droll Aesopic zoo in which the chatter
	Of chimp and chaffinch, manticore and mouse,
	Diverts us from all thought of entrecôtes,
	Prime ribs and rashers, filets mignonnettes,
	Provided for the paired pythons and jackals,
	Off to their catered second honeymoons
	On Noah’s forty-day excursion cruise.”
	
	
	_Shepherd:_
	
	Call it. if this should please you, but a dream,
	A bald, long-standing lie and mockery,
	Yet it deserves better than your contempt.
	Think also of that interstellar darkness,
	Silence and desolation from which the Tempter,
	Like a space capsule exiled into orbit,
	Looks down on our green cabinet of peace,
	A place classless and weaponless, without
	Envy or fossil fuel or architecture.
	Think of him as at dawn he views a snail
	Traveling with blind caution up the spine
	Of a frond asway with its little inching weight
	In windless nods that deepen with assent
	Till the ambler at last comes back to earth,
	Leaving his route, as on the boughs of heaven,
	Traced with a silver scrawl. The morning mist
	Haunts all about that action till the sun
	Makes of it a small glory, and the dew
	Holds the whole scale of rainbow, the accord
	Of stars and waters, luminously viewed
	At the same time by water-walking spiders
	That dimple a surface with their passages.
	In the lewd Viennese catalogue of dreams
	It’s one of the few to speak of without shame.
	
	
	_Townie:_
	
	It is the dream of a shepherd king or child,
	And is without all blemish except one:
	That it supposes all virtue to stem
	From pure simplicity. But many cures
	Of body and of spirit are the fruit
	Of cultivated thought. Kindness itself
	Depends on what we call consideration.
	Your fear of corruption is a fear of thought,
	Therefore you would be thoughtless. Think again.
	Consider the perfect hexagrams of snow,
	Those broadcast emblems of divinity,
	That prove in their unduplicable shapes
	Insights of Thales and Pythagoras.
	If you must dream, dream of the ratio
	Of Nine to Six to Four Palladio used
	To shape those rooms and chapels where the soul
	Imagines itself blessed, and finds its peace
	Even in chambers of the Malcontenta,
	Those just proportions we hypostatize
	Not as flat prairies but the City of God.


5. THE END OF THE WEEKEND

	A dying firelight slides along the quirt
	Of the cast iron cowboy where he leans
	Against my father’s books. The lariat
	Whirls into darkness. My girl in skin tight jeans
	Fingers a page of Captain Marriat
	Inviting insolent shadows to her shirt.
	We rise together to the second floor.
	Outside, across the lake, an endless wind
	Whips against the headstones of the dead and wails
	In the trees for all who have and have not sinned.
	She rubs against me and I feel her nails.
	Although we are alone, I lock the door.
	The eventual shapes of all our formless prayers:
	This dark, this cabin of loose imaginings,
	Wind, lip, lake, everything awaits
	The slow unloosening of her underthings
	And then the noise. Something is dropped. It grates
	against the attic beams. I climb the stairs
	Armed with a belt.
	A long magnesium shaft
	Of moonlight from the dormer cuts a path
	Among the shattered skeletons of mice.
	A great black presence beats its wings in wrath.
	Above the boneyard burn its golden eyes.
	Some small grey fur is pulsing in its grip.


6. A HILL

	In Italy, where this sort of thing can occur,
	I had a vision once; though you understand
	It was nothing at all like Dante’s, or the visions of saints,
	And perhaps not a vision at all. I was with some friends,
	Picking my way through a warm sunlit piazza
	In the early morning. A clear fretwork of shadows
	From huge umbrellas littered the pavement and made
	A sort of lucent shallows in which was moored
	A small navy of carts. Books, coins, old maps,
	Cheap landscapes and ugly religious prints
	Were all on sale. The colors and noise
	Like the flying hands were gestures of exultation,
	So that even the bargaining
	Rose to the ear like a voluble godliness.
	And then, where it happened, the noises suddenly stopped,
	And it got darker; pushcarts and people dissolved
	And even the great Farnese Palace itself
	Was gone, for all its marble; in its place
	Was a hill, mole-colored and bare. It was very cold,
	Close to freezing, with a promise of snow.
	The trees were like old ironwork gathered for scrap
	Outside a factory wall. There was no wind,
	And the only sound for a while was the little click
	Of ice as it broke in the mud under my feet.
	I saw a piece of ribbon snagged on a hedge,
	But no other sign of life. And then I heard
	What seemed the crack of a rifle. A hunter, I guessed;
	At least I was not alone. But just after that
	Came the soft and papery crash
	Of a great branch somewhere unseen falling to earth.
	And that was all, except for the cold and silence
	That promised to last forever, like the hill.
	Then prices came through, and fingers, and I was restored
	To the sunlight and my friends. But for more than a week
	I was scared by the plain bitterness of what I had seen.
	All this happened about ten years ago,
	And it hasn’t troubled me since, but at last, today,
	I remembered that hill; it lies just to the left
	Of the road north of Poughkeepsie; and as a boy
	I stood before it for hours in wintertime.


7. A LETTER

	I have been wondering
	What you are thinking about, and by now suppose
	It is certainly not me.
	But the crocus is up, and the lark, and the blundering
	Blood knows what it knows.
	It talks to itself all night, like a sliding moonlit sea.
	Of course, it is talking of you.
	At dawn, where the ocean has netted its catch of lights,
	The sun plants one lithe foot
	On that spill of mirrors, but the blood goes worming through
	Its warm Arabian nights,
	Naming your pounding name again in the dark heart-root.
	Who shall, of course, be nameless.
	Anyway, I should want you to know I have done my best,
	As I’m sure you have, too.
	Others are bound to us, the gentle and blameless
	Whose names are not confessed
	In the ceaseless palaver. My dearest, the clear unquaried blue
	
	Of those depths is all but blinding.
	You may remember that once you brought my boys
	Two little woolly birds.
	Yesterday the older one asked for you upon finding
	Your thrush among his toys.
	And the tides welled about me, and I could find no words.
	There is not much else to tell.
	One tries one’s best to continue as before,
	Doing some little good.
	But I would have you know that all is not well
	With a man dead set to ignore
	The endless repetitions of his own murmurous blood.


8. LOT’S WIFE

	How simple the pleasures of those childhood days,
	Simple but filled with exquisite satisfactions.
	The iridescent labyrinth of the spider,
	Its tethered tensor nest of polygons
	Puffed by the breeze to a little bellying sail--
	Merely observing this gave infinite pleasure.
	The sound of rain. The gentle graphite veil
	Of rain that makes of the world a steel engraving,
	Full of soft fadings and faint distances.
	The self-congratulations of a fly,
	Rubbing its hands. The brown bicameral brain
	Of a walnut. The smell of wax. The feel
	Of sugar to the tongue: a delicious sand.
	One understands immediately how Proust
	Might cherish all such postage-stamp details.
	Who can resist the charms of retrospection?


9. MORE LIGHT! MORE LIGHT!

	_for Heinrich Blücher and Hannah Arendt_
	
	Composed in the Tower before his execution
	These moving verses, and being brought at that time   
	Painfully to the stake, submitted, declaring thus:
	“I implore my God to witness that I have made no crime.”
	
	Nor was he forsaken of courage, but the death was horrible,   
	The sack of gunpowder failing to ignite.
	His legs were blistered sticks on which the black sap   
	Bubbled and burst as he howled for the Kindly Light.
	
	And that was but one, and by no means one of the worst;   
	Permitted at least his pitiful dignity;
	And such as were by made prayers in the name of Christ,   
	That shall judge all men, for his soul’s tranquillity.
	
	We move now to outside a German wood.   
	Three men are there commanded to dig a hole   
	In which the two Jews are ordered to lie down   
	And be buried alive by the third, who is a Pole.
	
	Not light from the shrine at Weimar beyond the hill   
	Nor light from heaven appeared. But he did refuse.   
	A Lüger settled back deeply in its glove.
	He was ordered to change places with the Jews.
	
	Much casual death had drained away their souls.   
	The thick dirt mounted toward the quivering chin.   
	When only the head was exposed the order came   
	To dig him out again and to get back in.
	
	No light, no light in the blue Polish eye.
	When he finished a riding boot packed down the earth.   
	The Lüger hovered lightly in its glove.
	He was shot in the belly and in three hours bled to death.
	
	No prayers or incense rose up in those hours
	Which grew to be years, and every day came mute   
	Ghosts from the ovens, sifting through crisp air,   
	And settled upon his eyes in a black soot.


10. PROSPECTS

	We have set out from here for the sublime
	Pastures of summer shade and mountain stream;
	I have no doubt we shall arrive on time.
	Is all the green of that enameled prime
	A snapshot recollection or a dream?
	We have set out from here for the sublime
	Without provisions, without one thin dime,
	And yet, for all our clumsiness, I deem
	It certain that we shall arrive on time.
	No guidebook tells you if you’ll have to climb
	Or swim. However foolish we may seem,
	We have set out from here for the sublime
	And must get past the scene of an old crime
	Before we falter and run out of steam,
	Riddled by doubt that we’ll arrive on time.
	Yet even in winter a pale paradigm
	Of birdsong utters its obsessive theme.
	We have set out from here for the sublime;
	I have no doubt we shall arrive on time.


11. THE TRANSPARENT MAN

	I’m mighty glad to see you, Mrs. Curtis,
	And thank you very kindly for this visit--
	Especially now when all the others here
	Are having holiday visitors, and I feel
	A little conspicuous and in the way.
	It’s mainly because of Thanksgiving. All these mothers
	And wives and husbands gaze at me soulfully
	And feel they should break up their box of chocolates
	For a donation, or hand me a chunk of fruitcake.
	What they don’t understand and never guess
	Is that it’s better for me without a family;
	It’s a great blessing. Though I mean no harm.
	And as for visitors, why, I have you,
	All cheerful, brisk and punctual every Sunday,
	Like church, even if the aisles smell of phenol.
	And you always bring even better gifts than any
	On your book-trolley. Though they mean only good,
	Families can become a sort of burden.
	I’ve only got my father, and he won’t come,
	Poor man, because it would be too much for him.
	And for me, too, so it’s best the way it is.
	He knows, you see, that I will predecease him,
	Which is hard enough. It would take a callous man
	To come and stand around and watch me failing.
	(Now don’t you fuss; we both know the plain facts.)
	But for him it’s even harder. He loved my mother.
	They say she looked like me; I suppose she may have.
	Or rather, as I grew older I came to look
	More and more like she must one time have looked,
	And so the prospect for my father now
	Of losing me is like having to lose her twice.
	I know he frets about me. Dr. Frazer
	Tells me he phones in every single day,
	Hoping that things will take a turn for the better.
	But with leukemia things don’t improve.
	It’s like a sort of blizzard in the bloodstream,
	A deep, severe, unseasonable winter,
	Burying everything. The white blood cells
	Multiply crazily and storm around,
	Out of control. The chemotherapy
	Hasn’t helped much, and it makes my hair fall out.
	I know I look a sight, but I don’t care.
	I care about fewer things; I’m more selective.
	It’s got so I can’t even bring myself
	To read through any of your books these days.
	It’s partly weariness, and partly the fact
	That I seem not to care much about the endings,
	How things work out, or whether they even do.
	What I do instead is sit here by this window
	And look out at the trees across the way.
	You wouldn’t think that was much, but let me tell you,
	It keeps me quite intent and occupied.
	Now all the leaves are down, you can see the spare,
	Delicate structures of the sycamores,
	The fine articulation of the beeches.
	I have sat here for days studying them,
	And I have only just begun to see
	What it is that they resemble. One by one,
	They stand there like magnificent enlargements
	Of the vascular system of the human brain.
	I see them there like huge discarnate minds,
	Lost in their meditative silences.
	The trunks, branches and twigs compose the vessels
	That feed and nourish vast immortal thoughts.
	So I’ve assigned them names. There, near the path,
	Is the great brain of Beethoven, and Kepler
	Haunts the wide spaces of that mountain ash.
	This view, you see, has become my Hall of Fame,
	It came to me one day when I remembered
	Mary Beth Finley who used to play with me
	When we were girls. One year her parents gave her
	A birthday toy called “The Transparent Man.”
	It was made of plastic, with different colored organs,
	And the circulatory system all mapped out
	In rivers of red and blue. She’d ask me over
	And the two of us would sit and study him
	Together, and do a powerful lot of giggling.
	I figure he’s most likely the only man
	Either of us would ever get to know
	Intimately, because Mary Beth became
	A Sister of Mercy when she was old enough.
	She must be thirty-one; she was a year
	Older than I, and about four inches taller.
	I used to envy both those advantages
	Back in those days. Anyway, I was struck
	Right from the start by the sea-weed intricacy,
	The fine-haired, silken-threaded filiations
	That wove, like Belgian lace, throughout the head.
	But this last week it seems I have found myself
	Looking beyond, or through, individual trees
	At the dense, clustered woodland just behind them,
	Where those great, nameless crowds patiently stand.
	It’s become a sort of complex, ultimate puzzle
	And keeps me fascinated. My eyes are twenty-twenty,
	Or used to be, but of course I can’t unravel
	The tousled snarl of intersecting limbs,
	That mackled, cinder grayness. It’s a riddle
	Beyond the eye’s solution. Impenetrable.
	If there is order in all that anarchy
	Of granite mezzotint, that wilderness,
	It takes a better eye than mine to see it.
	It set me on to wondering how to deal
	With such a thickness of particulars,
	Deal with it faithfully, you understand,
	Without blurring the issue. Of course I know
	That within a month the sleeving snows will come
	With cold, selective emphases, with massings
	And arbitrary contrasts, rendering things
	Deceptively simple, thickening the twigs
	To frosty veins, bestowing epaulets
	And decorations on every birch and aspen.
	And the eye, self-satisfied, will be misled,
	Thinking the puzzle solved, supposing at last
	It can look forth and comprehend the world.
	That’s when you have to really watch yourself.
	So I hope that you won’t think me plain ungrateful
	For not selecting one of your fine books,
	And I take it very kindly that you came
	And sat here and let me rattle on this way.
