*** Elizabeth Drew Stoddard (1823 - 1902)


1. AUTUMN

	No melancholy days are these!
	     Not where the maple changing stands,
	Not in the shade of fluttering oaks,
	            Nor in the bands
	
	Of twisting vines and sturdy shrubs,
	     Scarlet and yellow, green and brown,
	Falling, or swinging on their stalks,
	            Is Sorrow’s crown.
	
	The sparkling fields of dewy grass,
	     Woodpaths and roadsides decked with flowers,
	Starred asters and the goldenrod,
	            Date Autumn’s hours.
	
	The shining banks of snowy clouds,
	     Steadfast in the aerial blue,
	The silent, shimmering, silver sea,
	            To Joy are true.
	
	My spirit in this happy air
	     Can thus embrace the dying year,
	And with it wrap me in a shroud
	            As bright and clear!


2. A BABY SONG

	Come, white angels, to baby and me;
	     Touch his blue eyes with the image of sleep,
	     In his surprise he will cease to weep;
	Hush, child, the angels are coming to thee!
	
	Come, white doves, to baby and me;
	     Softly whirr in the silent air,
	     Flutter about his golden hair:
	Hark, child, the doves are cooing to thee!
	
	Come, white lilies, to baby and me;
	     Drowsily nod before his eyes,
	     So full of wonder, so round and wise:
	Hist, child, the lily-bells tinkle for thee!
	
	Come, white moon, to baby and me;
	     Gently glide o’er the ocean of sleep,
	     Silver the waves of its shadowy deep:
	Sleep, child, and the whitest of dreams to thee.


3. BEFORE THE MIRROR

	Now like the Lady of Shalott, 
	   I dwell within an empty room, 
	And through the day and through the night 
	   I sit before an ancient loom. 
	
	And like the Lady of Shalott 
	   I look into a mirror wide, 
	Where shadows come, and shadows go, 
	   And ply my shuttle as they glide. 
	
	Not as she wove the yellow wool, 
	   Ulysses’ wife, Penelope; 
	By day a queen among her maids, 
	   But in the night a woman, she, 
	
	Who, creeping from her lonely couch, 
	   Unraveled all the slender woof; 
	Or, with a torch, she climbed the towers, 
	   To fire the fagots on the roof! 
	
	But weaving with a steady hand 
	   The shadows, whether false or true, 
	I put aside a doubt which asks 
	   ‘Among these phantoms what are you?’ 
	
	For not with altar, tomb, or urn, 
	   Or long-haired Greek with hollow shield, 
	Or dark-prowed ship with banks of oars, 
	   Or banquet in the tented field; 
	
	Or Norman knight in armor clad, 
	   Waiting a foe where four roads meet; 
	Or hawk and hound in bosky dell, 
	   Where dame and page in secret greet; 
	
	Or rose and lily, bud and flower, 
	   My web is broidered. Nothing bright 
	Is woven here: the shadows grow 
	   Still darker in the mirror’s light! 
	
	And as my web grows darker too, 
	   Accursed seems this empty room; 
	For still I must forever weave 
	   These phantoms by this ancient loom.


4. CHRISTMAS COMES AGAIN

	Let me be merry now, ’t is time;
	     The season is at hand
	For Christmas rhyme and Christmas chime,
	     Close up, and form the band.
	
	The winter fires still burn as bright,
	     The lamp-light is as clear,
	And since the dead are out of sight,
	     What hinders Christmas cheer?
	
	Why think or speak of that abyss
	     In which lies all my Past?
	High festival I need not miss,
	     While song and jest shall last.
	
	We’ll clink and drink on Christmas Eve,
	     Our ghosts can feel no wrong;
	They revelled ere they took their leave--
	     Hearken, my Soldier’s Song:
	
	“The morning air doth coldly pass,
	Comrades, to the saddle spring;
	The night more bitter cold will bring
	Ere dying--ere dying.
	Sweetheart, come, the parting glass;
	Glass and sabre, clash, clash, clash,
	Ere dying--ere dying.
	Stirrup-cup and stirrup-kiss--
	Do you hope the foe we’ll miss,
	Sweetheart, for this loving kiss,
	Ere dying--ere dying?”
	
	The feasts and revels of the year
	     Do ghosts remember long?
	Even in memory come they here?
	     Listen, my Sailor’s song:
	
	“O my hearties. yo heave ho!
	Anchor’s up in Jolly Bay--
	Hey!
	Pipes and swipes, hob and nob--
	Hey!
	Mermaid Bess and Dolphin Meg,
	Paddle over Jolly Bay--
	Hey!
	Tars, haul in for Christmas Day,
	For round the ’varsal deep we go;
	Never church, never bell,
	For to tell
	Of Christmas Day.
	Yo heave ho, my hearties O!
	Haul in, mates, here we lay--
	Hey!”
	
	His sword is rusting in its sheath,
	     His flag furled on the wall;
	We’ll twine them with a holly-wreath,
	     With green leaves cover all.
	
	So clink and drink when falls the eve;
	     But, comrades, hide from me
	Their graves--I would not see them heave
	     Beside me, like the sea.
	
	Let not my brothers come again,
	     As men dead in their prime;
	Then hold my hands, forget my pain,
	     And strike the Christmas chime.


5. MARCH

	Ho, wind of March, speed over sea,
	     From mountains where the snows lie deep
	     The cruel glaciers threatening creep,
	And witness this, my jubilee!
	
	Roar from the surf of boreal isles,
	     Roar from the hidden, jagged steeps,
	     Where the destroyer never sleeps;
	Ring through the iceberg’s Gothic piles!
	
	Voyage through space with your wild train,
	     Harping its shrillest, searching tone,
	     Or wailing deep its ancient moan,
	And learn how impotent your reign.
	
	Then hover by this garden bed,
	     With all your willful power, behold,
	     Just breaking from the leafy mould,
	My little primrose lift its head!


6. NAMELESS PAIN

	I should be happy with my lot: 
	A wife and mother--is it not 
	Enough for me to be content? 
	What other blessing could be sent? 
	
	A quiet house, and homely ways, 
	That make each day like other days; 
	I only see Time’s shadow now 
	Darken the hair on baby’s brow! 
	
	No world’s work ever comes to me, 
	No beggar brings his misery; 
	I have no power, no healing art 
	With bruised soul or broken heart. 
	
	I read the poets of the age, 
	’Tis lotus-eating in a cage; 
	I study Art, but Art is dead 
	To one who clamors to be fed 
	
	With milk from Nature’s rugged breast, 
	Who longs for Labor’s lusty rest. 
	O foolish wish! I still should pine 
	If any other lot were mine.


7. NOVEMBER

	Much have I spoken of the faded leaf;	
	    Long have I listened to the wailing wind,	
	And watched it ploughing through the heavy clouds,	
	    For autumn charms my melancholy mind.	
	 
	When autumn comes, the poets sing a dirge:
	    The year must perish; all the flowers are dead;	
	The sheaves are gathered; and the mottled quail	
	    Runs in the stubble, but the lark has fled!	
	 
	Still, autumn ushers in the Christmas cheer,	
	    The holly-berries and the ivy-tree:
	They weave a chaplet for the Old Year’s bier,	
	    These waiting mourners do not sing for me!	
	 
	I find sweet peace in depths of autumn woods,	
	    Where grow the ragged ferns and roughened moss;	
	The naked, silent trees have taught me this,--
	    The loss of beauty is not always loss!


8. ONE MORN I LEFT HIM IN HIS BED

	One morn I left him in his bed; 
	A moment after some one said, 
	‘Your child is dying--he is dead.’ 
	
	We made him ready for his rest, 
	Flowers in his hair, and on his breast 
	His little hands together prest. 
	
	We sailed by night across the sea; 
	So, floating from the world were we, 
	Apart from sympathy, we Three. 
	
	The wild sea moaned, the black clouds spread 
	Moving shadows on its bed, 
	But one of us lay midship dead. 
	
	I saw his coffin sliding down 
	The yellow sand in yonder town, 
	Where I put on my sorrow’s crown. 
	
	And we returned; in this drear place 
	Never to see him face to face, 
	I thrust aside the living race. 
	
	Mothers, who mourn with me today, 
	Oh, understand me, when I say, 
	I cannot weep, I cannot pray; 
	
	I gaze upon a hidden store, 
	His books, his toys, the clothes he wore, 
	And cry, ‘Once more, to me, once more!’ 
	
	Then take, from me, this simple verse, 
	That you may know what I rehearse-- 
	A grief--your and my Universe!


9. A SUMMER NIGHT

	I feel the breath of the summer night,
	            Aromatic fire:
	The trees, the vines, the flowers are astir
	            With tender desire.
	
	The white moths flutter about the lamp,
	            Enamoured with light;
	And a thousand creates softly sing
	            A song to the night!
	
	But I am alone, and how can I sing
	            Praises to thee?
	Come, Night! unveil the beautiful soul
	            That waiteth for me.


10. THE WIFE SPEAKS

	Husband, today could you and I behold 
	The sun that brought us to our bridal morn 
	Rising so splendid in the winter sky 
	(We though fair spring returned), when we were wed; 
	Could the shades vanish from these fifteen years, 
	Which stand like columns guarding the approach 
	To that great temple of the double soul 
	That is as one--would you turn back, my dear, 
	And, for the sake of Love’s mysterious dream, 
	As old as Adam and as sweet as Eve, 
	Take me, as I took you, and once more go 
	Towards that goal which none of us have reached? 
	Contesting battles which but prove a loss, 
	The victor vanquished by the wounded one; 
	Teaching each other sacrifice of self, 
	True immolation to the marriage bond; 
	Learning the joys of birth, the woe of death, 
	Leaving in chaos all the hopes of life--
	Heart-broken, yet with courage pressing on 
	For fame and fortune, artists needing both? 
	Or, would you rather--I will acquiesce-- 
	Since we must choose what is, and are grown gray, 
	Stay in life’s desert, watch our setting sun, 
	Calm as those statues in Egyptian sands, 
	Hand clasping hand, with patience and with peace, 
	Wait for a future which contains no past?
