1. DESCRIPTION OF ELYSIUM

	_There: far, friends our dear dominion:_
	
	Whole health resides with peace,
	Gladness and never harm,
	There not time turning,
	Nor fear of flower of snow
	
	Where marbling water slides
	No charm may halt of chill,
	Air aisling the open acres,
	And all the gracious trees
	
	Spout up their standing fountains
	Of wind-beloved green
	And the blue conclaved mountains
	Are grave guards
	
	Stone and springing field
	Wide one tenderness,
	The unalterable hour
	Smiles deathlessness:
	
	No thing is there thinks:
	Mind the witherer
	Withers on the outward air:
	We can not come there.
	
	Sure on this shining night
	Of starmade shadows round,
	Kindness must watch for me
	This side the ground.
	
	The late year lies down the north.
	All is healed, all is health.
	High summer holds the earth.
	Hearts all whole.
	
	Sure on this shining night I weep for wonder wandering far alone
	Of shadows on the stars.
	
	Now thorn bone bare
	Silenced with iron the branch’s gullet:
	Rattling merely on the air
	Of hornleaved holly:
	
	The stony mark where sand was by 
	The water of a naild foot:
	The berry harder than the beak:
	The hole beneath the dead oak root:
	
	All now brought quiet
	Through the latest throe
	Quieted and ready and quiet:
	Still not snow:
	
	Still thorn bone hare
	Iron in the silenced gully
	Rattling only of the air
	Through hornleaved holly.


2. THE HAPPY HEN

	_(To Dr. Marie Stopes et al., and to all scientific lovers)_
	
	His hottest love and most delight
	The rooster knows for speed of fear
	And winds her down and treads her right
	And leaves her stuffed with dazzled cheer,
	
	Rumpled allwhichways in her lint,
	Who swears, shrugs, redeems her face,
	And serves to mind us how a sprint
	Heads swiftliest for the state of grace.
	
	I loitered weeping with my bride for gladness
	Her walking side against and both embracing
	Through the brash brightening rain that now the season
	      changes
	White on the fallen air that now my fallen
	                                  the fallen girl her grave effaces.


3. KNOXVILLE, SUMMER OF 1915

	It has become that time of evening
	When people sit on their porches
	Rocking gently and talking gently
	And watching the street
	And the standing up into their sphere
	Of possession of the trees,
	Of birds’ hung havens, hangars.
	People go by; things go by.
	A horse, drawing a buggy,
	Breaking his hollow iron music on the asphalt:
	A loud auto: a quiet auto:
	People in pairs, not in a hurry,
	Scuffling, switching their weight of aestival body,
	Talking casually,
	The taste hovering over them of vanilla,
	Strawberry, pasteboard, and starched milk,
	The image upon them of lovers and horsement,
	Squared with clowns in hueless amber.
	
	A streetcar raising into iron moan;
	Stopping;
	Belling and starting; stertorous;
	Rousing and raising again
	Its iron increasing moan
	And swimming its gold windows and straw seats
	On past and past and past
	The bleak spark crackling and cursing above it
	Like a small malignant spirit
	Set to dog its tracks;
	The iron whine rises on rising speed;
	Still risen, faints; halts;
	The faint stinging bell;
	Rises again, still fainter;
	Fainting, lifting lifts,
	Faints foregone;
	Forgotten.
	Now is the night one blue dew;
	My father has drained,
	He has coiled the hose.
	Low on the length of lawns,
	A frailing of fire who breathes.
	Parents on porches:
	Rock and rock.
	From damp strings morning glories hang their ancient faces.
	The dry and exalted noise of the locusts from all the air
	At once enchants my eardrums.
	On the rough wet grass
	Of the backyard
	My father and mother have spread quilts
	We all lie there, my mother, my father, my uncle, my aunt,
	And I too am lying there.
	They are not talking much, and the talk is quiet,
	Of nothing in particular,
	Of nothing at all.
	The stars are wide and alive,
	They all seem like a smile
	Of great sweetness,
	And they seem very near.
	All my people are larger bodies than mine,
	With voices gentle and meaningless
	Like the voices of sleeping birds.
	One is an artist, he is living at home.
	One is a musician, she is living at home.
	One is my mother who is good to me.
	One is my father who is good to me.
	By some chance, here they are,
	All on this earth;
	And who shall ever tell the sorrow
	Of being on this earth, lying, on quilts,
	On the grass,
	In a summer evening,
	Among the sounds of the night.
	May God bless my people,
	My uncle, my aunt, my mother, my good father,
	Oh, remember them kindly in their time of trouble;
	And in the hour of their taking away.
	After a little
	I am taken in
	And put to bed.
	Sleep, soft smiling,
	Draws me unto her;
	And those receive me,
	Who quietly treat me,
	As one familiar and well-beloved in that home:
	But will not, oh, will not,
	Not now, not ever;
	But will not ever tell me who I am.


4. ON THE WORD ASLEEP

	Asleep, perfected, you would never believe
	Harm of a one of them. That stirring hand,
	That leg, might clasp, endear, be brought across
	An enemy, as gently as a wife.
	How God must grieve,
	Watching in all this shadow land
	The flinching vigil candles of this countless loss
	In night’s nave each a life:
	Who groans, smiles, murmurs, quiets; then on the horn
	Transpierced, assembles upward, and reborn,
	By all that skill and bravery crowns him with
	Works, while he wakes, to put himself to death.


5. ON THE WORD KINGDOM

	In that kingdom no one cries.
	No one doubts, for no one lies.
	No son ever dreads his mother,
	Nor no brother envies brother.
	
	Families, there like nearby trees
	Spring and shelter, and the bees
	Groan among the cloudy flowers;
	Angels, each a soul devours.
	
	There continually the smile
	Of the heart that knows no guile.
	There, untroubled, people greet,
	Death like an old friend in the street.


6. OUR DOOM IS IN OUR BEING

	Our doom is in our being. We began
	In hunger eager more than ache of hell:
	And in that hunger became each a man
	Ravened with hunger death alone may spell:
	And in that hunger live, as lived the dead,
	Who sought, as now we seek, in the same ways,
	Nobly, and hatefully, what angel’s-bread
	Might ever stand us out those short few days.
	So is the race in this wild hour confounded:
	And though you rectify the big distress,
	And kill all outward wrong where wrong abounded,
	Your hunger cannot make this hunger less
	Which breeds all wrath and right, and shall not die
	In earth, and finds some hope upon the sky. 


7. OUTSKIRTS OF KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE

	There, in the earliest and chary spring, the dogwood
	flowers.
	
	Unharnessed in the friendly Sunday air
	By the red brambles, on the river bluffs,
	Clerks and their choices pair.
	
	Thrive by, not near, masked all away by shrub and 
	juniper,
	The Ford V8, racing the Chevrolet.
	
	They can not trouble her:
	
	Her breasts, helped open from the afforded lace,
	lie like a peaceful lake;
	And on his mouth she breaks her gentleness:
	
	Oh, wave them awake!
	
	They are not of the birds. Such innocence
	Brings us whole to break us only:
	Theirs are not happy words.
	
	We that are human cannot hope.
	Our tenderest joys oblige us most.
	No chain so cuts the bone; and sweetest silk most 
	shrewdly strangles.
	
	How this must end, that now please love were ended,
	In kitchens, bedfights, silences, women’s-pages,
	Sickness of heart before goldlettered doors,
	Stale flesh, hard collars, agony in antiseptic corridors,
	Spankings, remonstrances, fishing trips, orange juice,
	Policies, incapacities, a chevrolet,
	Scorn of their children, kind contempt exchanged,
	Recalls, tears, second honeymoons, pity,
	Shouted corrections of missed syllables,
	Hot water bags, gallstones, falls down stairs,
	Stammerings, soft foods, confusion of personalities,
	Oldfashioned christmases, suspicions of theft,
	Arrangements with morticians taken care of by sons in
	law,
	Small rooms beneath the gables of brick bungalows,
	The tumbler smashed, the glance between daughter and
	husband,
	The empty body in the lonely bed
	And, in the empty concrete porch, blown ash
	Grandchildren wandering the betraying sun
	
	Now, on the winsome crumbling shelves of the horror
	God show, God blind these children!


8. A PARABLE OF DOORS

	All things of life I term as many doors:
	Entrance to each or all, that man may win
	Who neither questions, nor no more implores
	But that with mindless ease he be let in.
	
	Such men are myriad and the door swings wide
	And smoothly they swarm through, who care not why,
	Initiate to those mysteries most denied
	Those who most seek them: such a man am I.
	
	I would expound those truths unalterably
	Flayed to strict harmonies no mind has sung.
	Mindful that truths are founded axially,
	By too much mind all hinges I have sprung:
	
	For it was thus: I lunged the brutal mind
	Shoulder to hinge post, since the truth stood there;
	Which neither yielded nor have I repined,
	But lunge and batter and am in despair.
	
	I cramped all gates of love forever shut,
	All beauty is for ever wrecked for me,
	And God all spiked with brain, and here is but
	One door, whose certitude the others flee.
	
	That door is death: and though my chief assault
	And shrewdest labor I’ve assemble there,
	Dark hinges no conjecture may default
	Soon shall devolve me on a doorless air.


9. PERMIT ME VOYAGE

	Take these who will as may be: I
	Am careless now of what they fail:
	My heart and mind discharted lie
	And surely as the nerved nail
	
	Appoints all quarters on the north
	So now it designates him forth
	My sovereign God my princely soul
	Whereon my flesh is priestly stole:
	
	Whence forth shall my heart and mind
	To God through soul entirely bow,
	Therein such strong increase to find
	In truth as is my fate to know:
	
	Small though that be great God I know
	I know in this gigantic day
	What God is ruined and I know
	How labors with Godhead this day:
	
	How from the porches of our sky
	The crested glory is declined:
	And hear with what translated cry
	The stridden soul is overshined:
	
	And how this world of wildness through
	True poets shall walk who herald you:
	Of whom God grant me of your grace
	To be, that shall preserve this race.
	
	Permit me voyage, Love, into your hands.


10. THE RENDEZVOUS

	The horn of resurrection
	    Globes world and skull with jubilance of sound:
	Perfect, my soul and flesh
	    Resolve from living sky and deathly ground.
	
	Ah, true to our appointment
	    You join me, that together we may rise
	To love’s eternity . . .
	     But tell me: what has saddened, so, your eyes?
	
	“Only that you, who loved me
	     Have waited long in vain new love to share:
	Before the blazing God
	     That cloudy love has burned to clearest air.”
	
	“Be sad no more; forget me
	     As now I can you: lost in God your soul:
	Me, love’s thin fever
	     Could not beguile from death’s white ruinous coal!”


11. SEASON OF CHANGE

	Season of change the sun for distaff bearing
	In your right hand and in the left large rains
	And writhen winds and noiselessly forth faring
	The earth abroad, and streaming wide your skeins,
	When in unfathomed fairness you have clothed
	The sea with quiet, the land with painless wealth,
	Turn you to those who changelessly have loathed
	All and their kind, and grant them peace and health:
	The proud stone-parting ardor of the tree,
	The glee of ice relaxed against new earth,
	Joy of the lamb and lust of bloom-struck bee
	Grant to the sick, stiff, spiteful, like fresh birth.
	Let this new time no natural wheel derange:
	Be ever changeless, thus: season of change.


12. SO IT BEGINS

	So it begins. Adam is in his earth.
	Tempted, and fallen, and his doom made sure
	Oh, in the very instant of his birth:
	Whose deathly nature must all things endure.
	The hungers of his flesh, and mind, and heart,
	That governed him when he was in the womb,
	Those ravenings multiply in every part:
	And shall release him only to the tomb.
	Meantime he works the earth, and builds up nations,
	And trades, and wars, and learns, and worships chance,
	And looks to God, and weaves the generations
	Which shall his many hungerings advance
	When he is sunken dead among the sins.
	Adam is in the earth. So it begins.


13. A SONG

	I had a little child was born in the month of May.
	He croaked and he crowed from early in the day.
	He sang like a bird and he delighted to play
	And before the night time he was gone away.
	
	Little child, take no fright,
	In that shadow where you are
	The toothless glowworm grants you light.
	Sure your mother’s not afar.
	
	Brave, brave, little boy,
	Angels wave you round with joy.
	Soon through the dark she runs to you,
	Soon, soon your mother comforts you.


14. SONNET

	I have been fashioned on a chain of flesh
	Whose ancient lengths are immolate to dust:
	Frail though that dust be as the dew’s mesh
	The morning mars, it holds me to a trust:
	My flesh that was, long as this flesh knew life,
	Strove, and was valiant, still strove, and was naught:
	Now it is mine to wage their valiant strife
	And failing seek still what they ever sought.
	I have been given wings they never wore.
	I have been given hope they never knew.
	And they were brave, who can be brave no more.
	And they that live are kind as they are few.
	˜Tis mine to touch with deathlessness their clay:
	And I shall fail, and join those I betray.


15. STRENGTHLESS THEY STAND

	Strengthless they stand assembled in the shadow,
	Blind to all strife and all to sorrow blind
	Who reared the tower, who scored the April meadow:
	Sheltered, they overshade my strengthless mind.
	Those hands that gave their kind ungentle power
	To summer’s travail, autumn did not spare:
	That mind which knew the clear, the intact hour,
	Now is disparted on a changeful air.
	
	The hands that ached to help are pithless bone
	(Mind, mind, the harsh pain and the unalloyed:
	What fruit you bear, that must you bear alone!)
	The broken helmet nods around its void:
	So I disclothe me of this shadow’s blight;
	And stand the axis of swift noon, sure night.


16. SUMMER EVENING

	Bandstands every Tuesday evening
	Bring us to the drawling square:
	Braid, glad horn, blunt drum, commend us
	Each another, shed of care.
	
	Locusts with enthusiasm
	Celebrate the spended day:
	In the dappling shadowed porchswing
	Love finds out the usual way.
	
	Children are composed this season.
	There is hope among us yet.
	Hope can cut the roots of reason:
	And the sorrowful man forget.


17. SUN OUR FATHER

	Sun our father while I slept
	You lifted like a field of corn
	The smiling and the peaceful strength
	Of those that are the race new born:
	
	The infant future waked in you
	Once more, and the world’s rich breast
	Drank the day’s courage and lay down
	In fearless and refreshing rest:
	
	And while the russian field you raised
	Dreams in the starflung shadow’s keep
	You wake these backward lands to work:
	Good work to do before we sleep.


18. SURE ON THIS SHINING NIGHT

	Sure on this shining night
	Of star made shadows round,
	Kindness must watch for me
	This side the ground.
	The late year lies down the north.
	All is healed, all is health.
	High summer holds the earth.
	Hearts all whole.
	Sure on this shining night I weep for wonder wand’ring far
	alone
	Of shadows on the stars.


19. THE WIDE EARTH’S ORCHARD

	The wide earth’s orchard of your time of knowing,
	Shine of the springtime pleasures into bloom
	And branched throes of health: but soon the snowing
	And tender foretaste of your afterdoom,
	Of fallen blossoming air persuades the air
	In hardier practices: and soon dilate
	Fruits and the air together that shall bear
	Earthward the heavied boughs and to their fate:
	Wrung of the wealth and wonder they unfurled
	By that same air: which air the sun deranges 
	To slope the living season from the world
	And charge the world with snow that all estranges.
	Watch well this sun, and air, and orchard green:
	None stay these changes every man has seen.
