*** Ezra Pound (1885 - 1972)


1. AND THE DAYS ARE NOT FULL ENOUGH

	And the days are not full enough
	And the nights are not full enough
	And life slips by like a field mouse
	Not shaking the grass



2. APRIL

	Three spirits came to me
	And drew me apart
	To where the olive boughs
	Lay stripped upon the ground:
	
	Pale carnage beneath bright mist.



3. BALLAD FOR GLOOM

	For God, our God is a gallant foe 
	That playeth behind the veil. 
	
	I have loved my God as a child at heart 
	That seeketh deep bosoms for rest, 
	I have loved my God as a maid to man--
	But lo, this thing is best: 
	
	To love your God as a gallant foe that plays behind the veil; 
	To meet your God as the night winds meet beyond Arcturus’ pale. 
	
	I have played with God for a woman, 
	I have staked with my God for truth, 
	I have lost to my God as a man, clear-eyed-- 
	His dice be not of ruth. 
	
	For I am made as a naked blade, 
	But hear ye this thing in sooth: 
	
	Who loseth to God as man to man 
	Shall win at the turn of the game. 
	I have drawn my blade where the lightnings meet 
	But the ending is the same: 
	Who loseth to God as the sword blades lose 
	Shall win at the end of the game. 
	
	For God, our God is a gallant foe that playeth behind the veil. 
	Whom God deigns not to overthrow hath need of triple mail.



4. BALLAD OF THE GOODLY FERE

	Ha’ we lost the goodliest fere o’ all
	For the priests and the gallows tree?
	Aye lover he was of brawny men,
	O’ ships and the open sea.
	
	When they came wi’ a host to take Our Man
	His smile was good to see,
	“First let these go!” quo’ our Goodly Fere,
	“Or I’ll see ye damned,” says he.
	
	Aye he sent us out through the crossed high spears
	And the scorn of his laugh rang free,
	“Why took ye not me when I walked about
	Alone in the town?” says he.
	
	Oh we drank his “Hale” in the good red wine
	When we last made company,
	No capon priest was the Goodly Fere
	But a man o’ men was he.
	
	I ha’ seen him drive a hundred men
	Wi’ a bundle o’ cords swung free,
	That they took the high and holy house
	For their pawn and treasury.
	
	They’ll no’ get him a’ in a book I think
	Though they write it cunningly;
	No mouse of the scrolls was the Goodly Fere
	But aye loved the open sea.
	
	If they think they ha’ snared our Goodly Fere
	They are fools to the last degree.
	“I’ll go to the feast,” quo’ our Goodly Fere,
	“Though I go to the gallows tree.”
	
	“Ye ha’ seen me heal the lame and blind,
	And wake the dead,” says he,
	“Ye shall see one thing to master all:
	’Tis how a brave man dies on the tree.”
	
	A son of God was the Goodly Fere
	That bade us his brothers be.
	I ha’ seen him cow a thousand men.
	I have seen him upon the tree.
	
	He cried no cry when they drave the nails
	And the blood gushed hot and free,
	The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue
	But never a cry cried he.
	
	I ha’ seen him cow a thousand men
	On the hills o’ Galilee,
	They whined as he walked out calm between,
	Wi’ his eyes like the grey o’ the sea,
	
	Like the sea that brooks no voyaging
	With the winds unleashed and free,
	Like the sea that he cowed at Genseret
	Wi’ twey words spoke’ suddently.
	
	A master of men was the Goodly Fere,
	A mate of the wind and sea,
	If they think they ha’ slain our Goodly Fere
	They are fools eternally.
	
	I ha’ seen him eat o’ the honey-comb
	Sin’ they nailed him to the tree.



5. THE BATH-TUB

	As a bathtub lined with white porcelain, 
	When the hot water gives out or goes tepid, 
	So is the slow cooling of our chivalrous passion, 
	O my much praised but-not-altogether-satisfactory lady.



6. BEFORE SLEEP

	The lateral vibrations caress me, 
	They leap and caress me, 
	They work pathetically in my favour, 
	They seek my financial good. 
	
	She of the spear stands present. 
	The gods of the underworld attend me, O Annubis, 
	These are they of thy company. 
	With a pathetic solicitude they attend me; 
	Undulant, 
	Their realm is the lateral courses. 
	
	
	Light! 
	I am up to follow thee, Pallas. 
	Up and out of their caresses. 
	You were gone up as a rocket, 
	Bending your passages from right to left and from left to right 
	In the flat projection of a spiral. 
	The gods of drugged sleep attend me, 
	Wishing me well; 
	I am up to follow thee, Pallas.



7. CANTO 1

	And then went down to the ship,
	Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, and
	We set up mast and sail on that swart ship,
	Bore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also
	Heavy with weeping, and winds from sternward
	Bore us out onward with bellying canvas,
	Circe’s this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.
	Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller,
	Thus with stretched sail, we went over sea till day’s end.
	Sun to his slumber, shadows o’er all the ocean,
	Came we then to the bounds of deepest water,
	To the Kimmerian lands, and peopled cities
	Covered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever
	With glitter of sun-rays
	Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven
	Swartest night stretched over wretched men there.
	The ocean flowing backward, came we then to the place
	Aforesaid by Circe.
	Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus,
	And drawing sword from my hip
	I dug the ell-square pitkin;
	Poured we libations unto each the dead,
	First mead and then sweet wine, water mixed with white flour.
	Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death’s-heads;
	As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best
	For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods,
	A sheep to Tiresias only, black and a bell-sheep.
	Dark blood flowed in the fosse,
	Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead, of brides
	Of youths and of the old who had borne much;
	Souls stained with recent tears, girls tender,
	Men many, mauled with bronze lance heads,
	Battle spoil, bearing yet dreory arms,
	These many crowded about me; with shouting,
	Pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;
	Slaughtered the herds, sheep slain of bronze;
	Poured ointment, cried to the gods,
	To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine;
	Unsheathed the narrow sword,
	I sat to keep off the impetuous impotent dead,
	Till I should hear Tiresias.
	But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor,
	Unburied, cast on the wide earth,
	Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,
	Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urged other.
	Pitiful spirit.   And I cried in hurried speech:
	“Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?
	“Cam’st thou afoot, outstripping seamen?”
	             And he in heavy speech:
	“Ill fate and abundant wine.    I slept in Circe’s ingle.
	“Going down the long ladder unguarded,
	“I fell against the buttress,
	“Shattered the nape-nerve, the soul sought Avernus.
	“But thou, O King, I bid remember me, unwept, unburied,
	“Heap up mine arms, be tomb by sea-bord, and inscribed:
	“A man of no fortune, and with a name to come. 
	“And set my oar up, that I swung mid fellows.”
	
	And Anticlea came, whom I beat off, and then Tiresias Theban,
	Holding his golden wand, knew me, and spoke first:
	“A second time? why? man of ill star,
	“Facing the sunless dead and this joyless region?
	“Stand from the fosse, leave me my bloody bever
	“For soothsay.”
	              And I stepped back,
	And he strong with the blood, said then: “Odysseus
	“Shalt return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas,
	“Lose all companions.”  And then Anticlea came.
	Lie quiet Divus. I mean, that is Andreas Divus,
	In officina Wecheli, 1538, out of Homer.
	And he sailed, by Sirens and thence outward and away
	And unto Circe.
	             Venerandam,
	In the Cretan’s phrase, with the golden crown, Aphrodite,
	Cypri munimenta sortita est, mirthful, orichalchi, with golden
	Girdles and breast bands, thou with dark eyelids
	Bearing the golden bough of Argicida. So that: 



8. CANTO 3

	I sat on the Dogana’s steps
	For the gondolas cost too much, that year,
	And there were not “those girls”, there was one face,
	And the Buccentoro twenty yards off, howling, “Stretti”,
	And the lit cross-beams, that year, in the Morosini,
	And peacocks in Koré’s house, or there may have been.
	             Gods float in the azure air,
	Bright gods and Tuscan, back before dew was shed.
	Light: and the first light, before ever dew was fallen.
	Panisks, and from the oak, dryas,
	And from the apple, mælid,
	Through all the wood, and the leaves are full of voices,
	A-whisper, and the clouds bowe over the lake,
	And there are gods upon them,
	And in the water, the almond-white swimmers,
	The silvery water glazes the upturned nipple,
	               As Poggio has remarked.
	Green veins in the turquoise,
	Or, the gray steps lead up under the cedars.
	
	My Cid rode up to Burgos,
	Up to the studded gate between two towers,
	Beat with his lance butt, and the child came out,
	Una niña de nueve años,
	To the little gallery over the gate, between the towers,
	Reading the writ, voce tinnula:
	That no man speak to, feed, help Ruy Diaz,
	On pain to have his heart out, set on a pike spike
	And both his eyes torn out, and all his goods sequestered,
	“And here, Myo Cid, are the seals,
	The big seal and the writing.”
	And he came down from Bivar, Myo Cid,
	With no hawks left there on their perches,
	And no clothes there in the presses,
	And left his trunk with Raquel and Vidas,
	That big box of sand, with the pawn-brokers,
	To get pay for his menie;
	Breaking his way to Valencia.
	Ignez de Castro murdered, and a wall
	Here stripped, here made to stand.
	Drear waste, the pigment flakes from the stone,
	Or plaster flakes, Mantegna painted the wall.
	Silk tatters, “Nec Spe Nec Metu.”



9. CANTO 4

	Palace in smoky light,
	Troy but a heap of smouldering boundary-stones,
	ANAXIFORMINGES! Aurunculeia!
	Hear me. Cadmus of Golden Prows!
	The silver mirrors catch the bright stones and flare,
	Dawn, to our waking, drifts in the green cool light;
	Dew-haze blurrs, in the grass, pale ankles moving.
	Beat, beat, whirr, thud, in the soft turf under the apple trees,
	Choros nympharum, goat-foot with the pale foot alternate;
	Crescent of blue-shot waters, green-gold in the shallows,
	A black cock crows in the sea-foam;
	
	And by the curved carved foot of the couch,
	             claw-foot and lion head, an old man seated
	Speaking in the low drone: . . .
	                                           “Ityn!
	“Et ter flebiliter. Ityn, Ityn!
	“And she went toward the window and cast her down,
	         “All the while, the while, swallows crying:
	“Ityn!”
	
	““_It is Cabestan’s heart in the dish._”
	““_It is Cabestan’s heart in the dish?_”
	““_No other taste shall change this._”
	
	And she went toward the window,
	                             the slim white stone bar
	Making a double arch;
	Firm even fingers held to the firm pale stone;
	Swung for a moment,
	                   and the wind out of Rhodez
	Caught in the full of her sleeve.
	. . . the swallows crying:
	“Ityn! Ityn!”
	
	         Actaeon . . .
	             And a valley,
	The valley is thick with leaves, with leaves, the trees,
	The sunlight glitters, glitters a-top,
	Like a fish-scale roof,
	         Like the church-roof in Poictiers
	If it were gold.
	               Beneath it, beneath it
	Not a ray, not a slivver, not a spare disk of sunlight
	Flaking the black, soft water;
	Bathing the body of nymphs, of nymphs, and Diana,
	Nymphs, white-gathered about her, and the air, air,
	Shaking, air alight with the goddess
	             fanning their hair in the dark,
	Lifting, lifting and waffing:
	Ivory dipping in silver,
	             Shadow’d, o’ershadow’d
	
	Ivory dipping in silver,
	Not a splotch, not a lost shatter of sunlight.
	Then Actaeon: Vidal,
	Vidal. It is old Vidal speaking,
	             stumbling along in the wood,
	Not a patch, not a lost shimmer of sunlight,
	             the pale hair of the goddess.
	
	The dogs leap on Actaeon,
	       “Hither, hither, Actaeon,”
	Spotted stag of the wood;
	Gold, gold, a sheaf of hair,
	         Thick like a wheat swath,
	Blaze, blaze in the sun,
	         The dogs leap on Actaeon.
	
	Stumbling, stumbling along in the wood,
	Muttering, muttering Ovid:
	     “Pergusa . . . pool . . . pool . . . Gargaphia,
	“Pool, pool of Salmacis.”
	       The empty armour shakes as the cygnet moves.
	Thus the light rains, thus pours, _e lo soleils plovil_,
	The liquid, and rushing crystal
	                       whirls up the bright brown sand.
	Ply over ply, thin glitter of water;
	Brook film bearing white petals
	 (“The pines of Takasago grow with pines of Isé”)
	       “Behold the Tree of the Visages.”
	The forked tips flaming as if with lotus,
	       Ply over ply
	The shallow eddying fluid
	                         beneath the knees of the gods.
	
	Torches melt in the glare
	       Set flame of the corner cook-stall,
	Blue agate casing the sky, a sputter of resin;
	The saffron sandal petals the narrow foot, Hymenaeus!
	       Io Hymen, Io Hymenaee! Aurunculeia!
	The scarlet flower is cast on the blanch-white stone,
	Armaracus, Hill of Urania’s Son.
	       Meanwhile So-Gioku:
	“This wind, sire, is the king’s wind,
	       this wind is wind of the palace
	Shaking imperial water-jets.”
	       And Ran-Ti, opening his collar:
	“This wind roars in the earth’s bag,
	                       it lays the water with rushes;
	“No wind is the king’s wind.
	       Let every cow keep her calf.”
	“This wind is held in gauze curtains . . .”
	       “No wind is the king’s . . .”
	
	The camel drivers sit in the turn of the stairs,
	       look down to Ecbatan of plotted streets,
	“Danae! Danae!
	       What wind is the king’s?”
	Smoke hangs on the stream,
	The peach-trees shed bright leaves in the water,
	Sound drifts in the evening haze,
	       The barge scrapes at the ford.
	Gilt rafters above black water;
	                           three steps in an open field
	Gray stone-posts leading nowhither.
	
	The Spanish poppies swim in an air of glass.
	Père Henri Jacques still seeks the sennin on Rokku.
	                                   Polhonac,
	As Gyges on Thracian platter, set the feast;
	Cabestan, Terreus.
	       It is Cabestan’s heart in the dish.
	Vidal, tracked out with dogs . . . for glamour of Loba;
	Upon the gilded tower in Ecbatan
	       Lay the god’s bride, lay ever
	Waiting the golden rain.
	       Et saave!
	But to-day, Garonne is thick like paint, beyond Dorada,
	The worm of the Procession bores in the soup of the crowd
	The blue thin voices against the crash of the crowd
	       Et “Salve regina.”
	
	In trellises
	 Wound over with small flowers, beyond Adige
	In the but half-used room, thin film of images,
	         (by Stefano)
	Age of unbodied gods, the vitreous fragile images
	Thin as the locust’s wing
	Haunting the mind . . . as of Guido . . .
	Thin as the locust’s wing. The Centaur’s heel
	Plants in the earth-loam.



10. CANTO 5

	Great bulk, huge mass, thesaurus;
	Ecbatan, the clock ticks and fades out;
	The bride awaiting the god’s touch; Ecbatan,
	City of patterned streets; again the vision:
	Down in the viae stradae, toga’d the crowd, and arm’d,
	Rushing on populous business, and from parapets
	Looked down--I looked, and thought: at North
	Was Egypt, and the celestial Nile, blue-deep, cutting low barren land,
	Old men and camels working the water-wheels;
	       Measureless seas and stars,
	Iamblichus’ light, the souls ascending,
	Sparks, like a partridge covey,
	       From the “ciocco,” brand struck in the game,
	“Et omniformis”:
	       Air, fire, the pale soft light.
	Topaz, I manage, and three sorts of blue;
	                               but on the barb of time.
	The fire? always, and the vision always,
	Ear dull, perhaps, with the vision, flitting
	And fading at will. Weaving with points of gold,
	Gold-yellow, saffron . . .
	                   the Roman shoe, Aurunculeia’s
	And come shuffling feet, and cries “Da nuces!
	“Nuces” praise and Hymenaeus “brings the girl to her man,”
	Titter of sound about me, always
	                           and from Hesperus . . .
	Hush of the older song: “Fades light from seacrest.
	
	“And in Lydia walks with pair’d women
	“Peerless among the pairs, and that once in Sardis
	“In satieties . . .
	         “Fades the light from the sea, and many things
	“Are set abroad and brought to mind of thee,”
	And the vinestocks lie untended, new leaves come to the shoots,
	North wind nips on the bough, and seas in heart
	Toss up chill crests,
	       And the vine stocks lie untended
	And many things are set abroad and brought to mind
	Of thee, Atthis, unfruitful.
	       The talks ran long in the night.
	
	And from Mauleon, fresh with a new earned grade,
	In maze of approaching rain-steps, Poicebot--
	The air was full of women. And Savairic Mauleon
	Gave him his land and knight’s fee, and he wed the woman.
	Came lust of travel on him, of _romerya_;
	And out of England a knight with slow-lifting eyelids
	_Lei fassa furar a del_, put glamour upon her . . .
	   And left her an eight months gone.
	       Came lust of woman upon him,
	Poicebot, now on North road from Spain
	(Sea-change, a grey in the water)
	       And in small house by town’s edge
	Found a woman, changed and familiar face,
	Hard night, and parting at morning.
	       And Pieire won the singing,
	Song or land on the throw, Pieire de Maensac,
	       and was dreitz hom
	And had De Tierci’s wife and with the war they made,
	Troy in Auvergnat.
	
	While Menelaus piled up the church at port
	He kept Tyndarida. Dauphin stood with de Maensac.
	John Borgia is bathed at last.
	       (Clock-tick pierces the vision)
	Tiber, dark with the cloak, wet cat, gleaming in patches.
	Click of the hooves, through garbage,
	Clutching the greasy stone. “And the cloak floated”
	Slander is up betimes.
	       But Varchi of Florence,
	Steeped in a different year, and pondering Brutus,
	Then
	       SIGA MAL AUTHIS DEUTERON!
	“Dog-eye!!” (to Alessandro)
	       “Whether for Love of Florence,” Varchi leaves it,
	Saying, “I saw the man, came up with him at Venice,
	“I, one wanting the facts,
	“And no mean labour.
	       Or for a privy spite?”
	           Good Varchi leaves it,
	But: “I saw the man. _Se pia?_
	“_O empia?_ For Lorenzaccio had thought of stroke in the open
	“But uncertain (for the Duke went never unguarded) . . .
	“And would have thrown him from wall
	“Yet feared this might not end him, or lest Alessandro
	“Know not by whom death came,

	“If when the foot slipped, when death came upon him,
	“Lest cousin Duke Alessandro think he had fallen alone
	“No friend to aid him in falling.”
	       _Caina attende._
	As beneath my feet a lake, was ice in seeming.
	
	And all of this, runs Varchi, dreamed out before hand
	In Perugia, caught in the star-maze by Del Carmine,
	Cast on a natal paper, set with an exegesis, told,
	All told to Alessandro, told thrice over,
	Who held his death for a doom.
	In abuleia.
	         But Don Lorenzino
	“Whether for love of Florence . . . but:
	         “O si morisse, credesse caduto da se.”
	                   SIGA, SIGA!
	The wet cloak floats on the surface,
	Schiavoni, caught on the wood-barge,
	Gives out the afterbirth, Giovanni Borgia
	Trails out no more at night, where Barabello
	Prods the Pope’s elephant, and gets no crown, where Mozarello
	Takes the Calabrian roadway, and for ending
	Is smothered beneath a mule,
	                           a poet’s ending,
	Down a stale well-hole, oh a poet’s ending. “Sanazarro
	“Alone out of all the court was faithful to him”
	For the gossip of Naples’ trouble drifts to North,
	Fracastor (lightning was midwife) Cotta, and Ser D’Alviano,
	Al poco giorno ed al gran cerchio d’ombra,
	Talk the talks out with Navighero,
	Burner of yearly Martials,
	                   (The slavelet is mourned in vain)
	And the next comer
	                 says “were nine wounds,
	“Four men, white horse with a double rider,”
	The hooves clink and slick on the cobbles . . .
	Schiavoni . . . the cloak floats on the water,
	“Sink the thing,” splash wakes Schiavoni;
	Tiber catching the nap, the moonlit velvet,
	Wet cat, gleaming in patches.
	         “Se pia,” Varchi,
	“O empia, ma risoluto
	“E terribile deliberazione”
	         Both sayings run in the wind,
	Ma si morisse!

	“The tale of thy deeds Odysseus!” and Tolosan

	But King, about to be, King Louis! takes a queen.
	“E quand lo reis Louis lo entendit
	                                 mout er fasché”
	And yet Gisors, in six years thence,
	Was Marguerite’s. And Harry _joven_
	In pledge for all his life and life of all his heirs
	Shall have Gisors and Vexis and Neauphal, Neufchastel;
	But if no issue, Gisors shall revert
	And Vexis and Neufchastel and Neauphal to the French crown.
	   “_Si tuit li dol el plor el marrimen
	Del mon_ were set together they would seem but light
	Against the death of the young English King,
	Harry the Young is dead and all men mourn, a song,
	Mourn all good courtiers, fighters, cantadors.”
	And still Old Harry keeps grip on Gisors
	And Neufchastel and Neauphal and Vexis;
	And two years war, and never two years go by
	         but come new forays, and “The wheel
	“Turns, Conrad, turns, and in the end toward ill.”
	And Richard and Alix span the gap, Gisors,
	And Eleanor and Richard face the King,
	For the fourth family time Plantagenet
	Faces his dam and whelps, . . . and holds Gisors,
	Now Alix’ dowry, against Philippe-Auguste
	(Louis’ by Adelaide, wood-lost, then crowned at Etampe)
	And never two years sans war.
	                                         And Zion still
	Bleating away to Eastward, the lost lamb,
	Damned city (was only Frederic knew
	The true worth of, and patched with Malek Kamel
	The sane and sensible peace to bait the world
	And set all camps disgruntled with all leaders.
	“Damn’d atheists!” alike Mahomet growls,
	And Christ grutches more sullen for Sicilian sense
	Than does Mahound on Malek.)
	                           The bright coat
	Is more to the era, and in Messina’s beach-way
	Des Barres and Richard split the reed-lances
	And the coat is torn.
	         (Moving in heavy air: Henry and Saladin.)
	(The serpent coils in the crowd.)
	The letters run: Tancred to Richard:
	
	         That the French King is
	         More against thee, than is his will to me
	         Good and in faith; and moves against your safety.
	
	Richard to Tancred:
	
	         That our pact stands firm,
	         And, for these slanders, that I think you lie.
	
	Proofs, and in writing:
	
	         And if Bourgogne say they were not
	         Deliver’d by hand and his,
	         Let him move sword against me and my word.
	
	Richard to Philip: silence, with a tone.
	
	Richard to Flanders: the subjoined and precedent.
	
	Philip a silence; and then, “Lies and turned lies
	“For that he will fail Alix
	“Affianced, and Sister to Ourself.”
	Richard: “My father’s bed-piece! A Plantagenet
	“Mewls on the covers, with a nose like his, already.”
	
	Then:
	
	   In the Name
	   Of Father and of Son Triune and Indivisible
	   Philip of France by Goddes Grace
	   To all men presents that our noble brother
	   Richard of England engaged by mutual oath
	             (a sacred covenant applicable to both)
	   Need _not_ wed Alix but whomso he choose
	   We cede him Gisors Neauphal and Vexis
	   And to the heirs male of his house
	   Cahors and Querci Richard’s the abbeys ours
	   Of Figeac and Souillac St. Gilles left still in peace
	   Alix returns to France.
	                     Made in Messina in
	   The year 1190 of the Incarnation of the Word.
	
	Reed lances broken, a cloak torn by Des Barres
	Do turn King Richard from the holy wars.
	                   And “God aid Conrad
	“For man’s aid comes slow,” Aye tarries upon the road,
	En Bertrans cantat.
	
	                   And before all this
	By Correze, Malemort
	A young man walks, at church with galleried porch
	By river-marsh, pacing,
	He was come from Ventadorn; and Eleanor turning on thirty years,
	Domna jauzionda, and he says to her
	                   “My lady of Ventadorn
	“Is shut by Eblis in, and will not hawk nor hunt
	“Nor get her free in the air,
	                   nor watch fish rise to bait
	“Nor the glare-wing’d flies alight in the creek’s edge
	“Save in my absence, Madame.
	                   ‘_Que la lauzeta mover_,’
	“Send word, I ask you, to Eblis,
	                   you have seen that maker
	“And finder of songs, so far afield as this
	“That he may free her,
	                   who sheds such light in the air.”



12. CANTO 7

	Eleanor (she spoiled in a British climate)
	‘Ελανδρος and Ελέπτολις, and poor old Homer
	blind, blind as a bat,
	Ear, ear for the sea-surge--; rattle of old men’s voices;
	And then the phantom Rome, marble narrow for seats
	         “Si pulvis nullus . . .”
	In chatter above the circus, “Nullum excute tamen.”
	Then: file and candles, e li mestiers ecoutes;
	Scene--for the battle only,--but still scene,
	Pennons and standards y cavals armatz,
	Not mere succession of strokes, sightless narration,
	To Dante’s “ciocco,” the brand struck in the game.
	Un peu moisi, plancher plus bas que le jardin.
	Contre le lambris, fauteuil de paille,
	Un vieux piano, et sous le baromètre . . .
	The old men’s voices--beneath the columns of false marble,
	And the walls tinted discreet, the modish, darkish green-blue,
	Discreeter gilding, and the panelled wood
	Not present, but suggested, for the leasehold is
	Touched with an imprecision . . . about three squares;
	The house a shade too solid, and the art
	A shade off action, paintings a shade too thick.
	And the great domed head, _con gli occhi onesti e tardi_
	Moves before me, phantom with weighted motion,
	_Grave incessu_, drinking the tone of things,
	And the old voice lifts itself
	                   weaving an endless sentence.
	We also made ghostly visits, and the stair
	That knew us, found us again on the turn of it,
	Knocking at empty rooms, seeking a buried beauty;
	And the sun-tanned gracious and well-formed fingers
	Lift no latch of bent bronze, no Empire handle
	Twists for the knocker’s fall; no voice to answer.
	A strange concierge, in place of the gouty-footed.
	Sceptic against all this one seeks the living,
	Stubborn against the fact. The wilted flowers
	Brushed out a seven year since, of no effect.
	Damn the partition! Paper, dark brown and stretched,
	Flimsy and damned partition.
	       Ione, dead the long year,
	My lintel, and Liu Ch’e’s lintel.
	Time blacked out with the rubber.
	       The Elysée carries a name on
	And the bus behind me gives me a date for peg;
	Low ceiling and the Erard and silver,
	These are in “time.” Four chairs, the bow-front dresser,
	The pannier of the desk, cloth top sunk in.
	       “Beer-bottle on the statue’s pediment!
	“That, Fritz, is the era, to-day against the past,
	“Contemporary.” And the passion endures.
	Against their action, aromas; rooms, against chronicles.
	Smaragdos, chrysolitos, De Gama wore striped pants in Africa
	And “Mountains of the sea gave birth to troops,”
	
	Le vieux commode en acajou:
	       beer bottles of various strata.
	But is she as dead as Tyro? In seven years?
	Έλέναυς, έλανδρος, έλέπτολις,
	The sea runs in the beach-groove, shaking the floated pebbles,
	Eleanor!
	       The scarlet curtain throws a less scarlet shadow;
	Lamplight at Buovilla, e quel remir,
	       And all that day
	Nicea moved before me
	And the cold gray air troubled her not
	For all her naked beauty, bit not the tropic skin,
	And the long slender feet lit on the curb’s marge
	And her moving height went before me,
	       We alone having being.
	
	And all that day, another day:
	       Thin husks I had known as men,
	Dry casques of departed locusts
	       speaking a shell of speech . . .
	Propped between chairs and table . . .
	Words like the locust-shells, moved by no inner being,
	       A dryness calling for death.
	Another day, between walls of a sham Mycenian,
	“Toc” sphinxes, sham-Memphis columns,
	And beneath the jazz a cortex, a stiffness or stillness;
	       The older shell, varnished to lemon colour,
	Brown-yellow wood, and the no colour plaster,
	Dry professorial talk . . .
	       now stilling the ill beat music,
	House expulsed by this house, but not extinguished.
	       Square even shoulders and the satin skin,
	Gone cheeks of the dancing woman,
	       Still the old dead dry talk, gassed out
	It is ten years gone, makes stiff about her a glass,
	A petrification of air.
	       The old room of the tawdry class asserts itself.
	The young men, never!
	       Only the husk of talk.
	O voi che siete in piccioletta barca,
	Dido choked up with sobs for her Sicheus
	Lies heavy in my arms, dead weight
	         Drowning with tears, new Eros,
	And the life goes on, mooning upon bare hills;
	Flame leaps from the hand, the rain is listless,
	Yet drinks the thirst from our lips,
	         solid as echo,
	Passion to breed a form in shimmer of rain-blurr;
	But Eros drowned, drowned, heavy-half dead with tears
	         For dead Sicheus.
	Life to make mock of motion:
	For the husks, before me, move,
	         The words rattle: shells given out by shells.
	
	The live man, out of lands and prisons,
	         shakes the dry pods,
	Probes for old wills and friendships, and the big locust-casques
	Bend to the tawdry table,
	Lift up their spoons to mouths, put forks in cutlets,
	And make sound like the sound of voices.
	         Lorenzaccio
	Being more live than they, more full of flames and voices.
	Ma si morisse!
	         Credesse caduto da se, ma si morisse.
	And the tall indifference moves,
	         a more living shell,
	Drift in the air of fate, dry phantom, but intact,
	O Alessandro, chief and thrice warned, watcher,
	         Eternal watcher of things,
	Of things, of men, of passions.
	         Eyes floating in dry, dark air;
	E biondo, with glass-gray iris, with an even side-fall of hair
	The stiff, still features.



13. THE CHOICE

	It is true that you say the gods are more use to you than fairies,
	But for all that I have seen you on a high, white, noble horse,
	Like some strange queen in a story.
	
	It is odd that you should be covered with long robes and trailing tendrils and flowers;
	It is odd that you should be changing your face and resembling some other woman to plague me;
	It is odd that you should be hiding yourself in the cloud of beautiful women, who do not concern me.
	
	And I, who follow every seed-leaf upon the wind!
	They will say that I deserve this.



14. COMMISSION

	Go, my songs, to the lonely and the unsatisfied,
	Go also to the nerve-wracked, go to the enslaved-by-convention,
	Bear to them my contempt for their oppressors.
	Go as a great wave of cool water,
	Bear my contempt of oppressors.
	
	Speak against unconscious oppression,
	Speak against the tyranny of the unimaginative,
	Speak against bonds.
	
	Go to the bourgeoise who is dying of her ennuis,
	Go to the women in suburbs.
	
	Go to the hideously wedded,
	Go to them whose failure is concealed,
	Go to the unluckily mated,
	Go to the bought wife,
	Go to the woman entailed.
	
	Go to those who have delicate lust,
	Go to those whose delicate desires are thwarted,
	Go like a blight upon the dulness of the world;
	Go with your edge against this,
	Strengthen the subtle cords,
	Bring confidence upon the algae and the tentacles of the soul.
	
	Go in a friendly manner,
	Go with an open speech.
	Be eager to find new evils and new good,
	Be against all forms of oppression.
	Go to those who are thickened with middle age,
	To those who have lost their interest.
	
	Go to the adolescent who are smothered in family--
	Oh how hideous it is
	To see three generations of one house gathered together!
	It is like an old tree with shoots,
	And with some branches rotted and falling.
	
	Go out and defy opinion,
	Go against this vegetable bondage of the blood.
	Speak for the free kinship of the mind and spirit.
	Go, against all forms of oppression.



15. DANCE FIGURE

	_For the Marriage in Cana of Galilee_
	
	Dark eyed,
	O woman of my dreams,
	Ivory sandaled,
	There is none like thee among the dancers,
	None with swift feet.
	
	I have not found thee in the tents,
	In the broken darkness.
	I have not found thee at the well-head
	Among the women with pitchers.
	
	Thine arms are as a young sapling under the bark;
	Thy face as a river with lights.
	
	White as an almond are thy shoulders;
	As new almonds stripped from the husk.
	They guard thee not with eunuchs;
	Not with bars of copper.
	Gilt turquoise and silver are in the place of thy rest.
	A brown robe, with threads of gold woven in patterns, hast thou gathered about thee,
	O Nathat-Ikanaie, “Tree-at-the-river”.
	
	As a rillet among the sedge are thy hands upon me;
	Thy fingers a frosted stream.
	
	Thy maidens are white like pebbles;
	Their music about thee!
	
	There is none like thee among the dancers;
	None with swift feet.



16. ENVOI

	_Go, dumb-born book,
	Tell her that sang me once that song of Lawes;
	Hadst thou but song
	As thou hast subjects known,
	Then were there cause in thee that should condone
	Even my faults that heavy upon me lie
	And build her glories their longevity._
	
	_Tell her that sheds
	Such treasure in the air,
	Reeking naught else but that her graces give
	Life to the moment,
	I would bid them live
	As roses might, in magic amber laid,
	Red overwrought with orange and all made
	One substance and one colour
	Braving time._
	
	_Tell her that goes
	With song upon her lips
	But sings not out the song, nor knows
	The maker of it, some other mouth,
	May be as fair as hers,
	Might, in new ages, gain her worshippers,
	When our two dusts with Waller’s shall be laid,
	Siftings on siftings in oblivion,
	Till change hath broken down
	All things save Beauty alone._



17. EZRA ON THE STRIKE

	Wal, Thanksgivin’ do be comin’ round.
	With the price of turkeys on the bound,
	And coal, by gum! Thet were just found,
	        Is surely gettin’ cheaper.
	
	The winds will soon begin to howl,
	And winter, in its yearly growl,
	Across the medders begin to prowl,
	        And Jack Frost gettin’ deeper.
	
	By shucks! It seems to me,
	That you I orter be
	Thankful, that our Ted could see
	        A way to operate it.
	
	I sez to Mandy, sure, sez I,
	I’ll bet thet air patch o’ rye
	Thet he’ll squash ’em by-and-by,
	        And he did, by cricket!
	
	No use talkin’, he’s the man-- 
	One of the best thet ever ran, 
	Fer didn’t I turn Republican
	        One o’ the fust?
	
	I ’lowed as how he’d beat the rest,
	But old Si Perkins, he hemmed and guessed,
	And sed as how it wuzn’t best
	        To meddle with the trust.



18. THE FISH AND THE SHADOW

	The salmon-trout drifts in the stream,
	The soul of the salmon-trout floats over the stream
	Like a little wafer of light.
	The salmon moves in the sun-shot, bright, shallow sea.
	
	As light as the shadow of the fish that falls through the water,
	She came into the large room by the stair.
	Yawning a little she came with the sleep still upon her.
	
	“I’m just from bed. The sleep is still in my eyes.
	Come. I have had a long dream.”
	
	And I: “That wood?
	And two springs have passed!”
	
	“Not so far--no, not so far now.
	There is a place--but no one else knows it--
	A field in a valley . . .
	       qu’ieu sui avinen
	leu lo sai.”
	
	She must speak of the time
	Of Arnaut de Mareuil, I thought, “qu’ieu sui avinen.”
	
	Light as the shadow of the fish
	That falls through the pale green water.



19. FOR THE TRIUMPH OF THE ARTS

	And what are the Arts?
	The Protagonist, “The Truths that speak
	with Beauty for a tongue.”
	
	And (to the protagonist) who art thou?
	“Write me then Mammon
	his arch enemy.”



20. FRAGMENTS

	O tender-heartedness right bitter grown
	Because they knew thee not in all the world
	Nor would, that gentleness thou hast to give.
	
	And are chevaliers in the court of Him
	Who reigneth ever where the stars grow dim
	Beyond our sight.
	
	Marble smooth by flowing waters grown.



21. FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS

	I
	
	O helpless few in my country,
	O remnant enslaved!
	
	Artists broken against her,
	A-stray, lost in the villages,
	Mistrusted, spoken-against,
	
	Lovers of beauty, starved,
	Thwarted with systems,
	Helpless against the control;
	
	You who can not wear yourselves out
	By persisting to successes,
	You who can only speak,
	Who can not steel yourselves into reiteration;
	
	You of the finer sense,
	Broken against false knowledge,
	You who can know at first hand,
	Hated, shut in, mistrusted:
	
	Take thought.
	I have weathered the storm,
	I have beaten out my exile.
	
	
	II
	
	The little Millwins attend the Russian Ballet.
	The mauve and greenish souls of the little Millwins
	Were seen lying along the upper seats
	Like so many unused boas.
	The turbulent and undisciplined host of art students-
	The rigorous deputation from “Slade”
	Was before them.
	With arms exalted, with fore-arms
	Crossed in great futuristic X’s, the art students
	Exulted, they beheld the splendors of Cleopatra.
	And the little Millwins beheld these things;
	With their large and anemic eyes they looked out upon
	this configuration.
	Let us therefore mention the fact,
	For it seems to us worthy of record.
	
	
	III
	
	Come, my songs, let us express our baser passions.
	Let us express our envy for the man with a steady job and no worry about the future.
	You are very idle, my songs,
	I fear you will come to a bad end.
	You stand about the streets, You loiter at the corners and bus-stops,
	You do next to nothing at all.
	
	You do not even express our inner nobilitys,
	You will come to a very bad end.
	
	And I? I have gone half-cracked.
	I have talked to you so much that I almost see you about me,
	Insolent little beasts! Shameless! Devoid of clothing!
	
	But you, newest song of the lot,
	You are not old enough to have done much mischief.
	I will get you a green coat out of China
	With dragons worked upon it.
	I will get you the scarlet silk trousers
	From the statue of the infant Christ at Santa Maria Novella;
	Lest they say we are lacking in taste,
	Or that there is no caste in this family.



22. THE GARDEN

	En robe de parade. Samain
	
	Like a skein of loose silk blown against a wall
	She walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,
	And she is dying piece-meal
	Of a sort of emotional anaemia.
	
	And round about there is a rabble
	Of the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.
	They shall inherit the earth.
	
	In her is the end of breeding.
	Her boredom is exquisite and excessive.
	She would like some one to speak to her,
	And is almost afraid that I
	Twill commit that indiscretion.



23. THE GARRET

	Come let us pity those who are better off than we are.
	Come, my friend, and remember that the rich have butlers and no friends,
	And we have friends and no butlers.
	Come let us pity the married and the unmarried.
	
	Dawn enters with little feet like a gilded Pavlova,
	And I am near my desire.
	Nor has life in it aught better
	Than this hour of clear coolness, the hour of waking together.



24. THE GIPSY

	_“Est-ce que vous avez vu des autres--des camarades--avec des singes ou des ours?”_
	       A stray gipsy--A. D. 1912
	
	That was the top of the walk, when he said:
	“Have you seen any others, any of our lot,
	With apes or bears?”--A brown upstanding fellow
	Not like the half-castes, up on the wet road near Clermont.
	The wind came, and the rain,
	And mist clotted about the trees in the valley,
	And I’d the long ways behind me, gray Arles and Biaucaire,
	And he said, “Have you seen any of our lot?”
	
	I’d seen a lot of his lot . . . ever since Rhodez,
	Coming down from the fair of St. John,
	With caravans, but never an ape or a bear.



25. A GIRL

	The tree has entered my hands,
	The sap has ascended my arms,
	The tree has grown in my breast--
	Downward,
	The branches grow out of me, like arms.
	
	Tree you are,
	Moss you are,
	You are violets with wind above them.
	A child--so high--you are,
	And all this is folly to the world.



26. I AGAINST FORM

	Whether my Lady will to hear of me
	The unrimed speech wherein the heart is heard,
	Or whether she prefer to the perfumed word
	And powdered cheek of masking irony?
	Decorous dance steps ape simplicity,
	The well-groomed sonnet is to truth preferred;
	Let us be all things so we’re not absurd,
	Dabble with forms and damn the verity.
	Bardlets and bardkins, I do bite my thumb.
	Corset the muse and “directoire” her grace,
	Marcel the elf-looks of _sa chevelure_,
	Enamel Melpomene’s too sun-kissed face
	And then to have your fame forged doubly sure
	Let taste rule all and bid the heart be dumb.



27. I WAIT

	As some pale-lidded ghost that calls
	I wait secure until that other goes
	Leaving thee free for thy high self of old,
	Upon which soul then free, will mine beget
	Such mighty fantasies as we before
	Bade stand effulgent and rejoice the world.
	
	I wait secure and waiting know I not
	A bite of anger at thy littleness, nor even envy
	Of that other one that bindeth thee
	Within the close-hewn shroud of womanhood.
	
	Being at peace with God and all his stars
	Why should I quail the stings of nettle Time
	Or fret the hour. Are there canals less green
	Or do the mottled colors of reflexion
	Less dew their waters with mild harmony?
	Is there less merriment and life withall
	Amid this hoard of half-tamed brats
	That rollick o’er the well-curb, while one crowned
	In mock of finery doth lead the rout
	Half-scared at all the new-found pomp
	Atop of him? A Czar in very soul
	And if they mock the world in this their spot
	Is not their jest as near to wisdom as are we?



28. AN IMMORALITY

	Sing we for love and idleness,
	Naught else is worth the having. 
	
	Though I have been in many a land,
	There is naught else in living. 
	
	And I would rather have my sweet,
	Though rose-leaves die of grieving, 
	
	Than do high deeds in Hungary
	To pass all men’s believing.



29. IN DURANCE

	I am homesick after mine own kind,
	Oh I know that there are folk about me, friendly faces,
	But I am homesick after mine own kind.
	
	“These sell our pictures! Oh well,
	They reach me not, touch me some edge or that,
	But reach me not and all my life’s become
	One flame, that reaches not beyond
	My heart’s own hearth,
	Or hides among the ashes there for thee.
	“Thee?” Oh, “Thee” is who cometh first
	Out of mine own soul-kin,
	For I am homesick after mine own kind
	And ordinary people touch me not.
	                                                And I am homesick
	After mine own kind that know, and feel
	And have some breath for beauty and the arts.
	
	Aye, I am wistful for my kin of the spirit
	And have none about me save in the shadows
	When come they, surging of power, “DAEMON,“
	“Quasi KALOUN.“ S.T. says Beauty is most that, a “calling to the soul.”
	Well then, so call they, the swirlers out of the mist of my soul,
	They that come mewards, bearing old magic.
	
	But for all that, I am homesick after mine own kind
	And would meet kindred even as I am,
	Flesh-shrouded bearing the secret.
	“All they that with strange sadness”
	Have the earth in mockery, and are kind to all,
	My fellows, aye I know the glory
	Of th’ unbounded ones, but ye, that hide
	As I hide most the while
	And burst forth to the windows only whiles or whiles
	For love, or hope, or beauty or for power,
	Then smoulder, with the lids half closed
	And are untouched by echoes of the world.
	Oh ye, my fellows: with the seas between us some be,
	Purple and sapphire for the silver shafts
	Of sun and spray all shattered at the bows;
	And some the hills hold off,
	The little hills to east of us, though here we
	Have damp and plain to be our shutting in.
	
	And yet my soul sings “Up!” and we are one.
	Yea thou, and Thou, and THOU, and all my kin
	To whom my breast and arms are ever warm,
	For that I love ye as the wind the trees
	That holds their blossoms and their leaves in cure
	And calls the utmost singing from the boughs
	That ‘thout him, save the aspen, were as dumb
	Still shade, and bade no whisper speak the birds of how
	“Beyond, beyond, beyond, there lies . . . ”



30. IN THE OLD AGE OF THE SOUL

	I do not choose to dream; there cometh on me
	Some strange old lust for deeds.
	As to the nerveless hand of some old warrior
	The sword-hilt or the war-worn wonted helmet
	Brings momentary life and long-fled cunning,
	So to my soul grown old--
	Grown old with many a jousting, many a foray,
	Grown old with many a hither-coming and hence-going--
	Till now they send him dreams and no more deed;
	So doth he flame again with might for action,
	Forgetful of the council of elders,
	Forgetful that who rules doth no more battle,
	Forgetful that such might no more cleaves to him
	So doth he flame again toward valiant doing.



31. INVERN

	Earth’s winter cometh
	And I being part of all
	And sith the spirit of all moveth in me
	I must needs bear earth’s winter
	Drawn cold and grey with hours
	And joying in a momentary sun,
	Lo I am withered with waiting till my spring cometh!
	Or crouch covetous of warmth
	O’er scant-logged ingle blaze,
	Must take cramped joy in tomed Longinus
	That, read I him first time
	The woods agleam with summer
	Or mid desirous winds of spring,
	Had set me singing spheres
	Or made heart to wander forth among warm roses
	Or curl in grass next neath a kindly moon.



32. IONE, DEAD THE LONG YEAR

	Empty are the ways, 
	Empty are the ways of this land 
	And the flowers 
	          Bend over with heavy heads. 
	They bend in vain. 
	Empty are the ways of this land 
	                                        Where Ione 
	Walked once, and now does not walk 
	But seems like a person just gone.



33. LADIES

	_Agathas_
	
	Four and forty lovers had Agathas in the old days, 
	All of whom she refused; 
	
	And now she turns to me seeking love, 
	And her hair also is turning. 
	
	
	_Young Lady_
	
	I have fed your lar with poppies, 
	I have adored you for three full years; 
	And now you grumble because your dress does not fit 
	And because I happen to say so. 
	
	
	_Lesbia Illa_
	
	Memnon, Memnon, that lady 
	Who used to walk about amongst us 
	With such gracious uncertainty, 
	Is now wedded 
	To a British householder. 
	_Lugete, Veneres! Lugete, Cupidinesque!_
	
	
	_Passing_
	
	Flawless as Aphrodite, 
	Thoroughly beautiful, 
	Brainless, 
	The faint odor of your patchouli, 
	Faint, almost, as the lines of cruelty about your chin, 
	Assails me, and concerns me almost as little.



34. THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION

	When earth’s last thesis is copied
	From the theses that went before,
	When idea from fact has departed
	And bare-boned factlets shall bore,
	When all joy shall have fled from study
	And scholarship reign supreme;
	When truth shall “baaa” on the hill crests
	And no one shall dare to dream;
	
	When all the good poems have been buried
	With comment annoted in full
	And art shall bow down in homage
	To scholarship’s zinc-plated bull,
	When there shall be nothing to research
	But the notes of annoted notes,
	And Baalam’s ass shall inquire
	The price of imported oats;
	
	Then no one shall tell him the answer
	For each shall know the one fact
	That lies in the special ass-ignment
	From which he is making his tract.
	So the ass shall sigh uninstructed
	While each in his separate book
	Shall grind for the love of grinding
	And only the devil shall look.



35. MASKS

	These tales of old disguisings, are they not
	Strange myths of souls that found themselves among
	Unwonted folk that spake an hostile tongue,
	Some soul from all the rest who’d not forgot
	The star-span acres of a former lot
	Where boundless mid the clouds his course he swung,
	Or carnate with his elder brothers sung
	Ere ballad-makers lisped of Camelot?
	
	Old singers half-forgetful of their tunes,
	Old painters color-blind come back once more,
	Old poets skill-less in the wind-heart runes,
	Old wizards lacking in their wonder-lore:
	
	All they that with strange sadness in their eyes
	Ponder in silence o’er earth’s queynt devyse?



36. MEDITATIO

	When I carefully consider the curious habits of dogs
	I am compelled to conclude
	That man is the superior animal. 
	
	When I consider the curious habits of man
	I confess, my friend, I am puzzled.



37. MIDDLE-AGED

	“’Tis but a vague, invarious delight. 
	As gold that rains about some buried king. 
	
	As the fine flakes, 
	When tourists frolicking 
	Stamp on his roof or in the glazing light 
	Try photographs, wolf down their ale and cakes 
	And start to inspect some further pyramid; 
	
	As the fine dust, in the hid cell beneath 
	Their transitory step and merriment, 
	Drifts through the air, and the sarcophagus 
	Gains yet another crust 
	Of useless riches for the occupant, 
	So I, the fires that lit once dreams 
	Now over and spent, 
	Lie dead within four walls 
	And so now love 
	Rains down and so enriches some stiff case, 
	And strews a mind with precious metaphors, 
	
	And so the space 
	Of my still consciousness 
	Is full of gilded snow, 
	
	The which, no cat has eyes enough 
	To see the brightness of.”



38. THE NEEDLE

	Come, or the stellar tide will slip away.
	Eastward avoid the hour of its decline,
	Now! for the needle trembles in my soul!
	
	Here have we had the vantage, the good hour.
	Here we have had our day, your day and mine.
	Come now, before this power
	That bears us up, shall turn against the pole.
	
	Mock not the flood of stars, the thing’s to be.
	O Love, come now, this land turns evil slowly.
	The waves bore in, soon will they bear away.
	
	The treasure is ours, make we fast land with it.
	Move we and take the tide, with its next favour,
	Abide
	Under some neutral force
	Until this course turneth aside.



39. NICOTINE

	_Hymn to the Dope_
	
	Goddess of the murmuring courts,
	Nicotine, my Nicotine,
	Houri of the mystic sports,
	trailing-robed in gabardine,
	Gliding where the breath hath glided,
	Hidden sylph of filmy veils,
	Truth behind the dream is veiléd
	E’en as thou art, smiling ever, ever gliding,
	Wraith of wraiths, dim lights dividing
	Purple, grey, and shadow green
	Goddess, Dream-grace, Nicotine.
	
	Goddess of the shadow’s lights,
	Nicotine, my Nicotine,
	Some would set old Earth to rights,
	Thou I none such ween.
	Veils of shade our dream dividing,
	Houris dancing, intergliding,
	Wraith of wraiths and dream of faces,
	Silent guardian of the old unhallowed places,
	Utter symbol of all old sweet druidings,
	Mem’ry of witched wold and green,
	Nicotine, my Nicotine:
	
	Neath the shadows of thy weaving
	Dreams that need no undeceiving,
	Loves that longer hold me not,
	Dreams I dream not any more,
	Fragrance of old sweet forgotten places,
	Smiles of dream-lit, flit-by faces
	All as perfume Arab-sweet
	Deck the high road to thy feet
	
	As were Godiva’s coming fated
	And all the April’s blush belated
	Were lain before her, carpeting
	The stones of Coventry with spring,
	So thou my mist-enwreathéd queen,
	Nicotine, white Nicotine,
	Riding engloried in they hair
	Mak’st by-road of our dreams
	Thy thorough-fare.



40. THE PLUNGE

	I would bathe myself in strangeness:
	These comforts heaped upon me, smother me!
	I burn, I scald so for the new,
	New friends, new faces,
	Places!
	Oh to be out of this,
	This that is all I wanted
	                  --save the new.
	
	And you,
	Love, you the much, the more desired!
	Do I not loathe all walls, streets, stones,
	All mire, mist, all fog,
	All ways of traffic?
	You, I wold have flow over me like water,
	Oh, but far out of this!
	Grass, and low fields, and hills,
	And sun,
	Oh, sun enough!
	Out, and alone, among some
	Alien people!



41. PORTRAIT D’UNE FEMME

	Your mind and you are our Sargasso Sea,
	London has swept about you this score years
	And bright ships left you this or that in fee:
	Ideas, old gossip, oddments of all things,
	Strange spars of knowledge and dimmed wares of price.
	Great minds have sought you--lacking someone else.
	You have been second always. Tragical?
	No. You preferred it to the usual thing:
	One dull man, dulling and uxorious,
	One average mind--with one thought less, each year.
	Oh, you are patient, I have seen you sit
	Hours, where something might have floated up.
	And now you pay one. Yes, you richly pay.
	You are a person of some interest, one comes to you
	And takes strange gain away:
	Trophies fished up; some curious suggestion;
	Fact that leads nowhere; and a tale for two,
	Pregnant with mandrakes, or with something else
	That might prove useful and yet never proves,
	That never fits a corner or shows use,
	Or finds its hour upon the loom of days:
	The tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work;
	Idols and ambergris and rare inlays,
	These are your riches, your great store; and yet
	For all this sea-hoard of deciduous things,
	Strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff:
	In the slow float of differing light and deep,
	No! there is nothing! In the whole and all,
	Nothing that’s quite your own.
	      Yet this is you.



42. THE RIVER-MERCHANT’S WIFE

	While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
	I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
	You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
	You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.
	And we went on living in the village of Chōkan:
	Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.
	
	At fourteen I married My Lord you.
	I never laughed, being bashful.
	Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
	Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.
	
	At fifteen I stopped scowling,
	I desired my dust to be mingled with yours
	Forever and forever, and forever.
	Why should I climb the look out?
	
	At sixteen you departed
	You went into far Ku-tō-en, by the river of swirling eddies,
	And you have been gone five months.
	The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.
	
	You dragged your feet when you went out.
	By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,
	Too deep to clear them away!
	The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.
	The paired butterflies are already yellow with August
	Over the grass in the West garden;
	They hurt me.
	I grow older.
	If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,
	Please let me know beforehand,
	And I will come out to meet you
	As far as Chō-fū-Sa.



43. SALUTATION

	O generation of the thoroughly smug
	      and thoroughly uncomfortable,
	I have seen fishermen picnicking in the sun,
	I have seen them with untidy families,
	I have seen their smiles full of teeth
	      and heard ungainly laughter.
	And I am happier than you are,
	And they were happier than I am;
	And the fish swim in the lake
	      and do not even own clothing.



44. THE SEAFARER

	May I for my own self song’s truth reckon, 
	Journey’s jargon, how I in harsh days 
	Hardship endured oft. 
	Bitter breast-cares have I abided, 
	Known on my keel many a care’s hold, 
	And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent 
	Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship’s head 
	While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted, 
	My feet were by frost benumbed. 
	Chill its chains are; chafing sighs 
	Hew my heart round and hunger begot 
	Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not 
	That he on dry land loveliest liveth, 
	List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea, 
	Weathered the winter, wretched outcast 
	Deprived of my kinsmen; 
	Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew, 
	There I heard naught save the harsh sea 
	And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries, 
	Did for my games the gannet’s clamour, 
	Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter, 
	The mews’ singing all my mead-drink. 
	Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern 
	In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed 
	With spray on his pinion. 
	Not any protector 
	May make merry man faring needy. 
	This he little believes, who aye in winsome life 
	Abides ‘mid burghers some heavy business, 
	Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft 
	Must bide above brine. 
	Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north, 
	Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then 
	Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now 
	The heart’s thought that I on high streams 
	The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone. 
	Moaneth alway my mind’s lust 
	That I fare forth, that I afar hence 
	Seek out a foreign fastness. 
	For this there’s no mood-lofty man over earth’s midst, 
	Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed; 
	Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful 
	But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare 
	Whatever his lord will. 
	He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having 
	Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world’s delight 
	Nor any whit else save the wave’s slash, 
	Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water. 
	Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries, 
	Fields to fairness, land fares brisker, 
	All this admonisheth man eager of mood, 
	The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks 
	On flood-ways to be far departing. 
	Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying, 
	He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow, 
	The bitter heart’s blood. Burgher knows not--
	He the prosperous man--what some perform 
	Where wandering them widest draweth. 
	So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock, 
	My mood ‘mid the mere-flood, 
	Over the whale’s acre, would wander wide. 
	On earth’s shelter cometh oft to me, 
	Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer, 
	Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly, 
	O’er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow 
	My lord deems to me this dead life 
	On loan and on land, I believe not 
	That any earth-weal eternal standeth 
	Save there be somewhat calamitous 
	That, ere a man’s tide go, turn it to twain. 
	Disease or oldness or sword-hate 
	Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body. 
	And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after--
	Laud of the living, boasteth some last word, 
	That he will work ere he pass onward, 
	Frame on the fair earth ‘gainst foes his malice, 
	Daring ado, . . . 
	So that all men shall honour him after 
	And his laud beyond them remain ‘mid the English, 
	Aye, for ever, a lasting life’s-blast, 
	Delight mid the doughty. 
	Days little durable, 
	And all arrogance of earthen riches, 
	There come now no kings nor Cæsars 
	Nor gold-giving lords like those gone. 
	Howe’er in mirth most magnified, 
	Whoe’er lived in life most lordliest, 
	Drear all this excellence, delights undurable! 
	Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth. 
	Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low. 
	Earthly glory ageth and seareth. 
	No man at all going the earth’s gait, 
	But age fares against him, his face paleth, 
	Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions, 
	Lordly men are to earth o’ergiven, 
	Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth, 
	Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry, 
	Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart, 
	And though he strew the grave with gold, 
	His born brothers, their buried bodies 
	Be an unlikely treasure hoard. 



45. SESTINA

	I
	
	Damn it all! All this our South stinks peace.
	You whoreson dog, Papiols, come! Let’s to music!
	I have no life save when the swords clash.
	But ah! when I see the standards gold, vair, purple, opposing
	And the broad fields beneath them turn crimson,
	Then howl I my heart nigh mad with rejoicing.
	
	
	II
	
	In hot summer have I great rejoicing
	When the tempests kill the earth’s foul peace,
	And the lightnings from black heav’n flash crimson,
	And the fierce thunders roar me their music
	And the winds shriek through the clouds mad, opposing,
	And through all the riven skies God’s swords clash.
	
	
	III
	
	Hell grant soon we hear again the swords clash!
	And the shrill neighs of destriers in battle rejoicing,
	Spiked breast to spiked breast opposing!
	Better one hour’s stour than a year’s peace
	With fat boards, bawds, wine and frail music!
	Bah! there’s no wine like the blood’s crimson!
	
	
	IV
	
	And I love to see the sun rise blood-crimson.
	And I watch his spears through the dark clash
	And it fills all my heart with rejoicing
	And pries wide my mouth with fast music
	When I see him so scorn and defy peace,
	His lone might ’gainst all darkness opposing.
	
	
	V
	
	The man who fears war and squats opposing
	My words for stour, hath no blood of crimson
	But is fit only to rot in womanish peace
	Far from where worth’s won and the swords clash
	For the death of such sluts I go rejoicing;
	Yea, I fill all the air with my music.
	
	
	VI
	
	Papiols, Papiols, to the music!
	There’s no sound like to swords swords opposing,
	No cry like the battle’s rejoicing
	When our elbows and swords drip the crimson
	And our charges ’gainst “The Leopard’s” rush clash.
	May God damn for ever all who cry “Peace!”
	
	
	VII
	
	And let the music of the swords make them crimson!
	Hell grant soon we hear again the swords clash!
	Hell blot black for alway the thought “Peace!”



46. SONG

	Love thou thy dream
	All base love scorning,
	Love thou the wind
	And here take warning
	That dreams alone can truly be,
	For ’tis in dream I come to thee.



47. SONG OF THE BOWMEN OF SHU

	Here we are, picking the first fern-shoots
	And saying: When shall we get back to our country?
	Here we are because we have the Ken-nin for our foemen,
	We have no comfort because of these Mongols.
	We grub the soft fern-shoots,
	When anyone says “Return,” the others are full of sorrow.
	Sorrowful minds, sorrow is strong, we are hungry and thirsty.
	Our defence is not yet made sure, no one can let his friend return.
	We grub the old fern-stalks.
	We say: Will we be let to go back in October?
	There is no ease in royal affairs, we have no comfort.
	Our sorrow is bitter, but we would not return to our country.
	What flower has come into blossom?
	Whose chariot? The General’s.
	Horses, his horses even, are tired. They were strong.
	We have no rest, three battles a month.
	By heaven, his horses are tired.
	The generals are on them, the soldiers are by them.
	The horses are well trained, the generals have ivory arrows and quivers ornamented with fishskin.
	The enemy is swift, we must be careful.
	When we set out, the willows were drooping with spring,
	We come back in the snow,
	We go slowly, we are hungry and thirsty,
	Our mind is full of sorrow, who will know of our grief?



48. THE SPRING

	Cydonian spring with her attendant train,
	Maelids and water-girls,
	Stepping beneath a boisterous wind from Thrace,
	Throughout this sylvan place
	Spreads the bright tips,
	And every vine-stock is
	Clad in new brilliancies.
	
	And wild desire
	Falls like black lightning.
	O bewildered heart,
	Though every branch have back what last year lost,
	She, who moved here amid the cyclamen,
	Moves only now a clinging tenuous ghost.



49. TENZONE

	Will people accept them?
	       (i.e. these songs)
	As a timorous wench from a centaur
	       (or a centurian),
	Already they flee, howling in terror.
	Will they be touched with the truth?
	       Their virgin stupidity is untemptable.
	I beg you, my friendly critics,
	Do not set about to procure me an audience.
	
	I mate with my free kind upon the crags;
	       the hidden recesses
	Have heard the echo of my heels.
	       in the cool light,
	       in the darkness.



50. THE TREE

	I stood still and was a tree amid the wood,
	Knowing the truth of things unseen before;
	Of Daphne and the laurel bow
	And that god-feasting couple old
	that grew elm-oak amid the wold.
	‘Twas not until the gods had been
	Kindly entreated, and been brought within
	Unto the hearth of their heart’s home
	That they might do this wonder thing;
	Nathless I have been a tree amid the wood
	And many a new thing understood
	That was rank folly to my head before.



51. A VIRGINAL

	No, no! Go from me. I have left her lately.
	I will not spoil my sheath with lesser brightness,   
	For my surrounding air hath a new lightness;
	Slight are her arms, yet they have bound me straitly   
	And left me cloaked as with a gauze of æther;   
	As with sweet leaves; as with subtle clearness.   
	Oh, I have picked up magic in her nearness
	To sheathe me half in half the things that sheathe her.   
	No, no! Go from me. I have still the flavour,   
	Soft as spring wind that’s come from birchen bowers.   
	Green come the shoots, aye April in the branches,
	As winter’s wound with her sleight hand she staunches,   
	Hath of the trees a likeness of the savour:
	As white their bark, so white this lady’s hours.
