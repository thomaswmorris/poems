1. AFTER THE STORM

	There are so many islands!
	As many islands as the stars at night
	on that branched tree from which meteors are shaken
	like falling fruit around the schooner Flight.
	But things must fall, and so it always was,
	on one hand Venus, on the other Mars;
	fall, and are one, just as this earth is one
	island in archipelagoes of stars.
	My first friend was the sea. Now,is my last.
	I stop talking now. I work, then I read,
	cotching under a lantern hooked to the mast.
	I try to forget what happiness was,
	and when that don’t work,I study the stars.
	Sometimes is just me, and the soft-scissored foam
	as the deck turn white and the moon open
	a cloud like a door, and the light over me
	is a road in white moonlight taking me home.
	Shabine sang to you from the depths of the sea.


2. A CITY’S DEATH BY FIRE

	After that hot gospeller has levelled all but the churched sky,
	I wrote the tale by tallow of a city’s death by fire;
	Under a candle’s eye, that smoked in tears, I
	Wanted to tell, in more than wax, of faiths that were snapped like wire.
	All day I walked abroad among the rubbled tales,
	Shocked at each wall that stood on the street like a liar;
	Loud was the bird-rocked sky, and all the clouds were bales
	Torn open by looting, and white, in spite of the fire.
	By the smoking sea, where Christ walked, I asked, why
	Should a man wax tears, when his wooden world fails?
	In town, leaves were paper, but the hills were a flock of faiths;
	To a boy who walked all day, each leaf was a green breath
	Rebuilding a love I thought was dead as nails,
	Blessing the death and the baptism by fire.


3. DARK AUGUST

	So much rain, so much life like the swollen sky
	of this black August. My sister, the sun,
	broods in her yellow room and won’t come out.
	
	Everything goes to hell; the mountains fume
	like a kettle, rivers overrun; still,
	she will not rise and turn off the rain.
	
	She is in her room, fondling old things,
	my poems, turning her album. Even if thunder falls
	like a crash of plates from the sky,
	
	she does not come out.
	Don’t you know I love you but am hopeless
	at fixing the rain? But I am learning slowly
	
	to love the dark days, the steaming hills,
	the air with gossiping mosquitoes,
	and to sip the medicine of bitterness,
	
	so that when you emerge, my sister,
	parting the beads of the rain,
	with your forehead of flowers and eyes of forgiveness,
	
	all with not be as it was, but it will be true
	(you see they will not let me love
	as I want), because, my sister, then
	
	I would have learnt to love black days like bright ones,
	The black rain, the white hills, when once
	I loved only my happiness and you.


4. A LESSON FOR THIS SUNDAY

	The growing idleness of summer grass
	With its frail kites of furious butterflies
	Requests the lemonade of simple praise
	In scansion gentler than my hammock swings
	And rituals no more upsetting than a
	Black maid shaking linen as she sings
	The plain notes of some Protestant hosanna—
	Since I lie idling from the thought in things—
	
	Or so they should, until I hear the cries
	Of two small children hunting yellow wings,
	Who break my Sabbath with the thought of sin.
	Brother and sister, with a common pin,
	Frowning like serious lepidopterists.
	The little surgeon pierces the thin eyes.
	Crouched on plump haunches, as a mantis prays
	She shrieks to eviscerate its abdomen.
	The lesson is the same. The maid removes
	Both prodigies from their interest in science.
	The girl, in lemon frock, begins to scream
	As the maimed, teetering thing attempts its flight.
	She is herself a thing of summery light,
	Frail as a flower in this blue August air,
	Not marked for some late grief that cannot speak.
	
	The mind swings inward on itself in fear
	Swayed towards nausea from each normal sign.
	Heredity of cruelty everywhere,
	And everywhere the frocks of summer torn,
	The long look back to see where choice is born,
	As summer grass sways to the scythe’s design.


5. LOVE AFTER LOVE

	The time will come 
	when, with elation 
	you will greet yourself arriving 
	at your own door, in your own mirror 
	and each will smile at the other’s welcome, 
	
	and say, sit here. Eat. 
	You will love again the stranger who was your self.
	Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart 
	to itself, to the stranger who has loved you 
	
	all your life, whom you ignored 
	for another, who knows you by heart. 
	Take down the love letters from the bookshelf, 
	
	the photographs, the desperate notes, 
	peel your own image from the mirror. 
	Sit. Feast on your life.


6. MIDSUMMER, TOBAGO

	Broad sun-stoned beaches.
	
	White heat.
	A green river.
	
	A bridge,
	scorched yellow palms
	
	from the summer-sleeping house
	drowsing through August.
	
	Days I have held,
	days I have lost,
	
	days that outgrow, like daughters,
	my harbouring arms.


7. PENTECOST

	Better a jungle in the head
	than rootless concrete.
	Better to stand bewildered
	by the fireflies’ crooked street;
	
	winter lamps do not show
	where the sidewalk is lost,
	nor can these tongues of snow
	speak for the Holy Ghost;
	
	the self-increasing silence
	of words dropped from a roof
	points along iron railings,
	direction, in not proof.
	
	But best is this night surf
	with slow scriptures of sand,
	that sends, not quite a seraph,
	but a late cormorant,
	
	whose fading cry propels
	through phosphorescent shoal
	what, in my childhood gospels,
	used to be called the Soul.


8. THE SEA IS HISTORY

	Where are your monuments, your battles, martyrs?
	Where is your tribal memory? Sirs,
	in that gray vault. The sea. The sea
	has locked them up. The sea is History.
	
	First, there was the heaving oil,
	heavy as chaos;
	then, likea light at the end of a tunnel,
	
	the lantern of a caravel,
	and that was Genesis.
	Then there were the packed cries,
	the shit, the moaning:
	
	Exodus.
	Bone soldered by coral to bone,
	mosaics
	mantled by the benediction of the shark’s shadow,
	
	that was the Ark of the Covenant.
	Then came from the plucked wires
	of sunlight on the sea floor
	
	the plangent harp of the Babylonian bondage,
	as the white cowries clustered like manacles
	on the drowned women,
	
	and those were the ivory bracelets
	of the Song of Solomon,
	but the ocean kept turning blank pages
	
	looking for History.
	Then came the men with eyes heavy as anchors
	who sank without tombs,
	
	brigands who barbecued cattle,
	leaving their charred ribs like palm leaves on the shore,
	then the foaming, rabid maw
	
	of the tidal wave swallowing Port Royal,
	and that was Jonah,
	but where is your Renaissance?
	
	Sir, it is locked in them sea sands
	out there past the reef’s moiling shelf,
	where the men-o’-war floated down;
	
	strop on these goggles, I’ll guide you there myself.
	It’s all subtle and submarine,
	through colonnades of coral,
	
	past the gothic windows of sea fans
	to where the crusty grouper, onyx-eyed,
	blinks, weighted by its jewels, like a bald queen;
	
	and these groined caves with barnacles
	pitted like stone
	are our cathedrals,
	
	and the furnace before the hurricanes:
	Gomorrah. Bones ground by windmills
	into marl and cornmeal,
	
	and that was Lamentations--
	that was just Lamentations,
	it was not History;
	
	then came, like scum on the river’s drying lip,
	the brown reeds of villages
	mantling and congealing into towns,
	
	and at evening, the midges’ choirs,
	and above them, the spires
	lancing the side of God
	
	as His son set, and that was the New Testament.
	
	Then came the white sisters clapping
	to the waves’ progress,
	and that was Emancipation--
	
	jubilation, O jubilation--
	vanishing swiftly
	as the sea’s lace dries in the sun,
	
	but that was not History,
	that was only faith,
	and then each rock broke into its own nation;
	
	then came the synod of flies,
	then came the secretarial heron,
	then came the bullfrog bellowing for a vote,
	
	fireflies with bright ideas
	and bats like jetting ambassadors
	and the mantis, like khaki police,
	
	and the furred caterpillars of judges
	examining each case closely,
	and then in the dark ears of ferns
	
	and in the salt chuckle of rocks
	with their sea pools, there was the sound
	like a rumour without any echo
	
	of History, really beginning.
