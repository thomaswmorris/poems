*** William Cowper (1731 - 1800)


1. ABUSE OF THE GOSPEL

	Too many, Lord, abuse Thy grace 
	In this licentious day, 
	And while they boast they see Thy face, 
	They turn their own away. 
	
	Thy book displays a gracious light 
	That can the blind restore; 
	But these are dazzled by the sight, 
	And blinded still the more. 
	
	The pardon such presume upon, 
	They do not beg but steal; 
	And when they plead it at Thy throne, 
	Oh! where’s the Spirit’s seal? 
	
	Was it for this, ye lawless tribe, 
	The dear Redeemer bled? 
	Is this the grace the saints imbibe 
	From Christ the living head? 
	
	Ah, Lord, we know Thy chosen few 
	Are fed with heavenly fare; 
	But these,--the wretched husks they chew, 
	Proclaim them what they are. 
	
	The liberty our hearts implore 
	Is not to live in sin; 
	But still to wait at Wisdom’s door, 
	Till Mercy calls us in.


2. THE CASTAWAY

	Obscurest night involv’d the sky, 
	        Th’ Atlantic billows roar’d, 
	When such a destin’d wretch as I, 
	        Wash’d headlong from on board, 
	Of friends, of hope, of all bereft, 
	His floating home for ever left. 
	
	No braver chief could Albion boast 
	        Than he with whom he went, 
	Nor ever ship left Albion’s coast, 
	        With warmer wishes sent. 
	He lov’d them both, but both in vain, 
	Nor him beheld, nor her again. 
	
	Not long beneath the whelming brine, 
	        Expert to swim, he lay; 
	Nor soon he felt his strength decline, 
	        Or courage die away; 
	But wag’d with death a lasting strife, 
	Supported by despair of life. 
	
	He shouted: nor his friends had fail’d 
	        To check the vessel’s course, 
	But so the furious blast prevail’d, 
	        That, pitiless perforce, 
	They left their outcast mate behind, 
	And scudded still before the wind. 
	
	Some succour yet they could afford; 
	        And, such as storms allow, 
	The cask, the coop, the floated cord, 
	        Delay’d not to bestow. 
	But he (they knew) nor ship, nor shore, 
	Whate’er they gave, should visit more. 
	
	Nor, cruel as it seem’d, could he 
	        Their haste himself condemn, 
	Aware that flight, in such a sea, 
	        Alone could rescue them; 
	Yet bitter felt it still to die 
	Deserted, and his friends so nigh. 
	
	He long survives, who lives an hour 
	        In ocean, self-upheld; 
	And so long he, with unspent pow’r, 
	        His destiny repell’d; 
	And ever, as the minutes flew, 
	Entreated help, or cried—Adieu! 
	
	At length, his transient respite past, 
	        His comrades, who before 
	Had heard his voice in ev’ry blast, 
	        Could catch the sound no more. 
	For then, by toil subdued, he drank 
	The stifling wave, and then he sank. 
	
	No poet wept him: but the page 
	        Of narrative sincere; 
	That tells his name, his worth, his age, 
	        Is wet with Anson’s tear. 
	And tears by bards or heroes shed 
	Alike immortalize the dead. 
	
	I therefore purpose not, or dream, 
	        Descanting on his fate, 
	To give the melancholy theme 
	        A more enduring date: 
	But misery still delights to trace 
	  Its semblance in another’s case. 
	
	No voice divine the storm allay’d, 
	        No light propitious shone; 
	When, snatch’d from all effectual aid, 
	        We perish’d, each alone: 
	But I beneath a rougher sea, 
	And whelm’d in deeper gulfs than he. 


3. AN EXHORTATION TO PRAYER

	What various hindrances we meet 
	In coming to a mercy seat! 
	Yet who that knows the worth of prayer, 
	But wishes to be often there? 
	
	Prayer makes the darken’d cloud withdraw, 
	Prayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw, 
	Gives exercise to faith and love, 
	Brings every blessing from above. 
	
	Restraining prayer, we cease to fight; 
	Prayer makes the Christian’s armour bright; 
	And Satan trembles when he sees 
	The weakest saint upon his knees. 
	
	While Moses stood with arms spread wide, 
	Success was found on Israel’s side; 
	But when through weariness they fail’d, 
	That moment Amalek prevail’d. 
	
	Have you no words? Ah, think again, 
	Words flow apace when you complain, 
	And fill your fellow-creature’s ear 
	With the sad tale of all your care. 
	
	Were half the breath thus vainly spent 
	To heaven in supplication sent, 
	Your cheerful song would oftener be, 
	“Hear what the Lord has done for me.”


4. LIGHT SHINING OUT OF DARKNESS

	God moves in a mysterious way,
	 His wonders to perform;
	He plants his footsteps in the sea,
	 And rides upon the storm.
	
	Deep in unfathomable mines
	 Of never-failing skill,
	He treasures up his bright designs,
	 And works his sov’reign will.
	
	Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take,
	 The clouds ye so much dread
	Are big with mercy, and shall break
	 In blessings on your head.
	
	Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
	 But trust him for his grace;
	Behind a frowning providence
	 He hides a smiling face.
	
	His purposes will ripen fast,
	 Unfolding ev’ry hour;
	The bud may have a bitter taste,
	 But sweet will be the flow’r.
	
	Blind unbelief is sure to err,
	 And scan his work in vain;
	God is his own interpreter,
	 And he will make it plain.


5. TO MARY

	THE twentieth year is well-nigh past
	Since first our sky was overcast;
	Ah, would that this might be the last!
	                               My Mary!
	Thy spirits have a fainter flow,
	I see thee daily weaker grow--
	‘Twas my distress that brought thee low,
	                               My Mary!
	
	Thy needles, once a shining store,
	For my sake restless heretofore,
	Now rust disus’d, and shine no more,
	                               My Mary!
	
	For though thou gladly wouldst fulfil
	The same kind office for me still,
	Thy sight now seconds not thy will,
	                               My Mary!
	
	But well thou play’d'st the housewife’s part,
	And all thy threads with magic art
	Have wound themselves about this heart,
	                               My Mary!
	
	Thy indistinct expressions seem
	Like language utter’d in a dream;
	Yet me they charm, whate’er the theme,
	                               My Mary!
	
	Thy silver locks, once auburn bright,
	Are still more lovely in my sight
	Than golden beams of orient light,
	                               My Mary!
	
	For could I view nor them nor thee,
	What sight worth seeing could I see?
	The sun would rise in vain for me,
	                               My Mary!
	
	Partakers of thy sad decline,
	Thy hands their little force resign;
	Yet, gently prest, press gently mine,
	                               My Mary!
	
	And then I feel that still I hold
	A richer store ten thousandfold
	Than misers fancy in their gold,
	                               My Mary!
	
	Such feebleness of limbs thou prov’st,
	That now at every step thou mov’st
	Upheld by two; yet still thou lov’st,
	                               My Mary!
	
	And still to love, though prest with ill,
	In wintry age to feel no chill,
	With me is to be lovely still,
	                               My Mary!
	
	But ah! by constant heed I know,
	How oft the sadness that I show
	Transforms thy smiles to looks of woe,
	                               My Mary!
	
	And should my future lot be cast
	With much resemblance of the past,
	Thy worn-out heart will break at last--
	                               My Mary!
