*** Edwin Muir (1887 - 1959)


1. ABRAHAM

	The rivulet-loving wanderer Abraham
	Through waterless wastes tracing his fields of pasture
	Led his Chaldean herds and fattening flocks
	With the meandering art of wavering water
	That seeks and finds, yet does not know its way.
	He came, rested and prospered, and went on,
	Scattering behind him little pastoral kingdoms,
	And over each one its own particular sky,
	Not the great rounded sky through which he journeyed,
	That went with him but when he rested changed.
	His mind was full of names
	Learned from strange peoples speaking alien tongues,
	And all that was theirs one day he would inherit.
	He died content and full of years, though still
	The Promise had not come, and left his bones,
	Far from his father’s house, in alien Canaan.


2. THE CASTLE

	All through that summer at ease we lay,
	And daily from the turret wall
	We watched the mowers in the hay
	And the enemy half a mile away
	They seemed no threat to us at all.
	
	For what, we thought, had we to fear
	With our arms and provender, load on load,
	Our towering battlements, tier on tier,
	And friendly allies drawing near
	On every leafy summer road.
	
	Our gates were strong, our walls were thick,
	So smooth and high, no man could win
	A foothold there, no clever trick
	Could take us, have us dead or quick.
	Only a bird could have got in.
	
	What could they offer us for bait?
	Our captain was brave and we were true . . .
	There was a little private gate,
	A little wicked wicket gate.
	The wizened warder let them through.
	
	Oh then our maze of tunneled stone
	Grew thin and treacherous as air.
	The cause was lost without a groan,
	The famous citadel overthrown,
	And all its secret galleries bare.
	
	How can this shameful tale be told?
	I will maintain until my death
	We could do nothing, being sold;
	Our only enemy was gold,
	And we had no arms to fight it with.


3. THE COMBAT

	It was not meant for human eyes,
	That combat on the shabby patch
	Of clods and trampled turf that lies
	Somewhere beneath the sodden skies
	For eye of toad or adder to catch.
	
	And having seen it I accuse
	The crested animal in his pride,
	Arrayed in all the royal hues
	Which hide the claws he well can use
	To tear the heart out of the side.
	
	Body of leopard, eagle’s head
	And whetted beak, and lion’s mane,
	And frost-grey hedge of feathers spread
	Behind--he seemed of all things bred.
	I shall not see his like again.
	
	As for his enemy there came in
	A soft round beast as brown as clay;
	All rent and patched his wretched skin;
	A battered bag he might have been,
	Some old used thing to throw away.
	
	Yet he awaited face to face
	The furious beast and the swift attack.
	Soon over and done. That was no place
	Or time for chivalry or for grace.
	The fury had him on his back.
	
	And two small paws like hands flew out
	To right and left as the trees stood by.
	One would have said beyond a doubt
	That was the very end of the bout,
	But that the creature would not die.
	
	For ere the death-stroke he was gone,
	Writhed, whirled, into his den,
	Safe somehow there. The fight was done,
	And he had lost who had all but won.
	But oh his deadly fury then.
	
	A while the place lay blank, forlorn,
	Drowsing as in relief from pain.
	The cricket chirped, the grating thorn
	Stirred, and a little sound was born.
	The champions took their posts again.
	
	And all began. The stealthy paw
	Slashed out and in. Could nothing save
	These rags and tatters from the claw?
	Nothing. And yet I never saw
	A beast so helpless and so brave.
	
	And now, while the trees stand watching, still
	The unequal battle rages there.
	The killing beast that cannot kill
	Swells and swells in his fury till
	You’d almost think it was despair.


4. THE DYING CHILD

	Unfriendly friendly universe,
	I pack your stars into my purse,
	And bid you so farewell.
	That I can leave you, quite go out,
	Go out, go out beyond all doubt,
	My father says, is the miracle.
	
	You are so great, and I so small:
	I am nothing, you are all:
	Being nothing, I can take this way.
	Oh I need neither rise nor fall,
	For when I do not move at all
	I shall be out of all your day.
	
	It’s said some memory will remain
	In the other place, grass in the rain,
	Light on the land, sun on the sea,
	A flitting grace, a phantom face,
	But the world is out. There is not place
	Where it and its ghost can ever be.
	
	Father, father, I dread this air
	Blown from the far side of despair
	The cold cold corner. What house, what hold,
	What hand is there? I look and see
	Nothing-filled eternity,
	And the great round world grows weak and old.
	
	Hold my hand, oh hold it fast--
	I am changing!--until at last
	My hand in yours no more will change,
	Though yours change on. You here, I there,
	So hand in hand, twin-leafed despair--
	I did not know death was so strange.


5. THE FATHERS

	Our fathers all were poor,
	Poorer our fathers’ fathers;
	Beyond, we dare not look.
	We, the sons, keep store
	Of tarnished gold that gathers
	Around us from the night,
	Record it in this book
	That, when the line is drawn,
	Credit and creditor gone,
	Column and figure flown,
	Will open into light.
	
	Archaic fevers shake
	Our healthy flesh and blood
	Plumped in the passing day
	And fed with pleasant food.
	The fathers’ anger and ache
	Will not, will not away
	And leave the living alone,
	But on our careless brows
	Faintly their furrows engrave
	Like veinings in a stone,
	Breathe in the sunny house
	Nightmare of blackened bone,
	Cellar and choking cave.
	
	Panics and furies fly
	Through our unhurried veins,
	Heavenly lights and rains
	Purify heart and eye,
	Past agonies purify
	And lay the sullen dust.
	The angers will not away.
	We hold our fathers’ trust,
	Wrong, riches, sorrow and all
	Until they topple and fall,
	And fallen let in the day.


6. THE HORSES

	Barely a twelvemonth after
	The seven days war that put the world to sleep,
	Late in the evening the strange horses came.
	By then we had made our covenant with silence,
	But in the first few days it was so still
	We listened to our breathing and were afraid.
	On the second day
	The radios failed; we turned the knobs; no answer.
	On the third day a warship passed us, heading north,
	Dead bodies piled on the deck. On the sixth day
	A plane plunged over us into the sea. Thereafter
	Nothing. The radios dumb;
	And still they stand in corners of our kitchens,
	And stand, perhaps, turned on, in a million rooms
	All over the world. But now if they should speak,
	If on a sudden they should speak again,
	If on the stroke of noon a voice should speak,
	We would not listen, we would not let it bring
	That old bad world that swallowed its children quick
	At one great gulp. We would not have it again.
	Sometimes we think of the nations lying asleep,
	Curled blindly in impenetrable sorrow,
	And then the thought confounds us with its strangeness.
	The tractors lie about our fields; at evening
	They look like dank sea-monsters couched and waiting.
	We leave them where they are and let them rust:
	“They’ll molder away and be like other loam.”
	We make our oxen drag our rusty plows,
	Long laid aside. We have gone back
	Far past our fathers’ land.
	And then, that evening
	Late in the summer the strange horses came.
	We heard a distant tapping on the road,
	A deepening drumming; it stopped, went on again
	And at the corner changed to hollow thunder.
	We saw the heads
	Like a wild wave charging and were afraid.
	We had sold our horses in our fathers’ time
	To buy new tractors. Now they were strange to us
	As fabulous steeds set on an ancient shield.
	Or illustrations in a book of knights.
	We did not dare go near them. Yet they waited,
	Stubborn and shy, as if they had been sent
	By an old command to find our whereabouts
	And that long-lost archaic companionship.
	In the first moment we had never a thought
	That they were creatures to be owned and used.
	Among them were some half a dozen colts
	Dropped in some wilderness of the broken world,
	Yet new as if they had come from their own Eden.
	Since then they have pulled our plows and borne our loads,
	But that free servitude still can pierce our hearts.
	Our life is changed; their coming our beginning.


7. THE INCARNATE ONE

	The windless northern surge, the sea-gull’s scream,
	And Calvin’s kirk crowning the barren brae.
	I think of Giotto the Tuscan shepherd’s dream,
	Christ, man and creature in their inner day.
	How could our race betray
	The Image, and the Incarnate One unmake
	Who chose this form and fashion for our sake?
	
	The Word made flesh here is made word again
	A word made word in flourish and arrogant crook.
	See there King Calvin with his iron pen,
	And God three angry letters in a book,
	And there the logical hook
	On which the Mystery is impaled and bent
	Into an ideological argument.
	
	There’s better gospel in man’s natural tongue,
	And truer sight was theirs outside the Law
	Who saw the far side of the Cross among
	The archaic peoples in their ancient awe,
	In ignorant wonder saw
	The wooden cross-tree on the bare hillside,
	Not knowing that there a God suffered and died.
	
	The fleshless word, growing, will bring us down,
	Pagan and Christian man alike will fall,
	The auguries say, the white and black and brown,
	The merry and the sad, theorist, lover, all
	Invisibly will fall:
	Abstract calamity, save for those who can
	Build their cold empire on the abstract man.
	
	A soft breeze stirs and all my thoughts are blown
	Far out to sea and lost. Yet I know well
	The bloodless word will battle for its own
	Invisibly in brain and nerve and cell.
	The generations tell
	Their personal tale: the One has far to go
	Past the mirages and the murdering snow.


8. SCOTLAND’S WINTER

	Now the ice lays its smooth claws on the sill,
	The sun looks from the hill
	Helmed in his winter casket,
	And sweeps his arctic sword across the sky.
	The water at the mill
	Sounds more hoarse and dull.
	The miller’s daughter walking by
	With frozen fingers soldered to her basket
	Seems to be knocking
	Upon a hundred leagues of floor
	With her light heels, and mocking
	Percy and Douglas dead,
	And Bruce on his burial bed,
	Where he lies white as may
	With wars and leprosy,
	And all the kings before
	This land was kingless,
	And all the singers before
	This land was songless,
	This land that with its dead and living waits the Judgement Day.
	But they, the powerless dead,
	Listening can hear no more
	Than a hard tapping on the floor
	A little overhead
	Of common heels that do not know
	Whence they come or where they go
	And are content
	With their poor frozen life and shallow banishment.
