*** Leonard Cohen (1934 - 2016)


1. ANTHEM

	The birds they sang
	at the break of day
	Start again
	I heard them say
	Don’t dwell on what
	has passed away
	or what is yet to be.
	Ah the wars they will
	be fought again
	The holy dove
	She will be caught again
	bought and sold
	and bought again
	the dove is never free.
	Ring the bells that still can ring
	Forget your perfect offering
	There is a crack in everything
	That’s how the light gets in.
	We asked for signs
	the signs were sent:
	the birth betrayed
	the marriage spent
	Yeah the widowhood
	of every government --
	signs for all to see.
	I can’t run no more
	with that lawless crowd
	while the killers in high places
	say their prayers out loud.
	But they’ve summoned, they’ve summoned up
	a thundercloud
	and they’re going to hear from me.
	Ring the bells that still can ring . . .
	You can add up the parts
	but you won’t have the sum
	You can strike up the march,
	there is no drum
	Every heart, every heart
	to love will come
	but like a refugee.
	Ring the bells that still can ring
	Forget your perfect offering
	There is a crack, a crack in everything
	That’s how the light gets in.
	Ring the bells that still can ring
	Forget your perfect offering
	There is a crack, a crack in everything
	That’s how the light gets in.
	That’s how the light gets in.
	That’s how the light gets in.


2. BIRD ON THE WIRE

	Like a bird on the wire,
	like a drunk in a midnight choir
	I have tried in my way to be free.
	
	Like a worm on a hook,
	like a knight from some old fashioned book
	I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
	
	If I, if I have been unkind,
	I hope that you can just let it go by.
	If I, if I have been untrue
	I hope you know it was never to you.
	
	Like a baby, stillborn,
	like a beast with his horn
	I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
	
	But I swear by this song
	and by all that I have done wrong
	I will make it all up to thee.
	
	I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
	he said to me, “You must not ask for so much.”
	And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
	she cried to me, “Hey, why not ask for more?”
	
	Oh like a bird on the wire,
	like a drunk in a midnight choir
	I have tried in my way to be free.


3. DANCE ME TO THE END OF LOVE

	Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
	Dance me through the panic ‘til I’m gathered safely in
	Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
	Dance me to the end of love
	Dance me to the end of love
	Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
	Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
	Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
	Dance me to the end of love
	Dance me to the end of love
	Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
	Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
	We’re both of us beneath our love, we’re both of us above
	Dance me to the end of love
	Dance me to the end of love
	Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
	Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
	Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
	Dance me to the end of love
	Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
	Dance me through the panic till I’m gathered safely in
	Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
	Dance me to the end of love
	Dance me to the end of love
	Dance me to the end of love


4. THE FUTURE

	Give me back my broken night
	my mirrored room, my secret life
	it’s lonely here,
	there’s no one left to torture
	Give me absolute control
	over every living soul
	And lie beside me, baby,
	that’s an order!
	Give me crack and anal sex
	Take the only tree that’s left
	and stuff it up the hole
	in your culture
	Give me back the Berlin wall
	give me Stalin and St Paul
	I’ve seen the future, brother:
	it is murder.
	Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
	Won’t be nothing
	Nothing you can measure anymore
	The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
	has crossed the threshold
	and it has overturned
	the order of the soul
	When they said REPENT REPENT
	I wonder what they meant
	When they said REPENT REPENT
	I wonder what they meant
	When they said REPENT REPENT
	I wonder what they meant
	You don’t know me from the wind
	you never will, you never did
	I’m the little jew
	who wrote the Bible
	I’ve seen the nations rise and fall
	I’ve heard their stories, heard them all
	but love’s the only engine of survival
	Your servant here, he has been told
	to say it clear, to say it cold:
	It’s over, it ain’t going
	any further
	And now the wheels of heaven stop
	you feel the devil’s riding crop
	Get ready for the future:
	it is murder
	Things are going to slide . . .
	There’ll be the breaking of the ancient
	western code
	Your private life will suddenly explode
	There’ll be phantoms
	There’ll be fires on the road
	and the white man dancing
	You’ll see a woman
	hanging upside down
	her features covered by her fallen gown
	and all the lousy little poets
	coming round
	tryin’ to sound like Charlie Manson
	and the white man dancin’
	Give me back the Berlin wall
	Give me Stalin and St Paul
	Give me Christ
	or give me Hiroshima
	Destroy another fetus now
	We don’t like children anyhow
	I’ve seen the future, baby:
	it is murder.


5. SISTERS OF MERCY

	Oh the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone.
	They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can’t go on.
	And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song.
	Oh I hope you run into them, you who’ve been travelling so long.
	Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control.
	
	It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul.
	Well I’ve been where you’re hanging, I think I can see how you’re pinned:
	When you’re not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you’ve sinned.
	Well they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them.
	They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem.
	
	If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn
	they will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem.
	When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon.
	Don’t turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon.
	And you won’t make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night:
	We weren’t lovers like that and besides it would still be all right,
	We weren’t lovers like that and besides it would still be all right.


6. STORIES OF THE STREET

	The stories of the street are mine
	The Spanish voices laugh
	The Cadillacs go creeping now 
	Through the night and the poison gas
	And I lean from my window sill
	In this old hotel I chose
	Yes, one hand on my suicide
	One hand on the rose
	
	I know you’ve heard it’s over now
	And war must surely come
	The cities they all broke in half
	And the middlemen are gone
	But let me ask you one more time
	O children of the dusk
	All these hunters who are shrieking now 
	Oh, do they speak for us?
	And where do all these highways go
	Now that we are free?
	Why are the armies marching still
	That were coming home to me?
	
	O lady with your legs so fine
	O stranger at your wheel
	You are locked into your suffering 
	And your pleasures are the seal
	The age of lust is giving birth
	And both the parents ask
	The nurse to tell them fairy tales 
	On both sides of the glass
	And now the infant with his cord
	Is hauled in like a kite
	And one eye filled with blueprints
	One eye filled with night
	
	O come with me my little one
	We will find that farm
	And grow us grass and apples there
	And keep all the animals warm
	And if by chance I wake at night 
	And I ask you who I am
	O take me to the slaughterhouse
	I will wait there with the lamb
	With one hand on the hexagram
	And one hand on the girl
	I balance on a wishing well
	That all men call the world
	
	We are so small between the stars
	So large against the sky
	And lost among the subway crowds
	I try to catch your eye


7. TAKE THIS WALTZ

	Now in Vienna there are ten pretty women.
	There’s a shoulder where death comes to cry.
	There’s a lobby with nine hundred windows.
	There’s a tree where the doves go to die.
	There’s a piece that was torn from the morning,
	and it hangs in the Gallery of Frost--
	Ay, ay ay ay
	Take this waltz, take this waltz,
	take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws.
	
	I want you, I want you, I want you
	on a chair with a dead magazine.
	In the cave at the tip of the lily,
	in some hallway where love’s never been.
	On a bed where the moon has been sweating,
	in a cry filled with footsteps and sand--
	Ay, ay ay ay
	Take this waltz, take this waltz,
	take its broken waist in your hand.
	
	This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
	with its very own breath
	of brandy and death,
	dragging its tail in the sea.
	
	There’s a concert hall in Vienna
	where your mouth had a thousand reviews.
	There’s a bar where the boys have stopped talking,
	they’ve been sentenced to death by the blues.
	Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
	with a garland of freshly cut tears?
	Ay, ay ay ay
	Take this waltz, take this waltz,
	take this waltz, it’s been dying for years.
	
	There’s an attic where children are playing,
	where I’ve got to lie down with you soon,
	in a dream of Hungarian lanterns,
	in the mist of some sweet afternoon.
	And I’ll see what you’ve chained to your sorrow,
	all your sheep and your lilies of snow--
	Ay, ay ay ay
	Take this waltz, take this waltz
	with its “I’ll never forget you, you know!”
	
	And I’ll dance with you in Vienna,
	I’ll be wearing a river’s disguise.
	The hyacinth wild on my shoulder
	my mouth on the dew of your thighs.
	And I’ll bury my soul in a scrapbook,
	with the photographs there and the moss.
	And I’ll yield to the flood of your beauty,
	my cheap violin and my cross.
	And you’ll carry me down on your dancing
	to the pools that you lift on your wrist--
	O my love, O my love
	Take this waltz, take this waltz,
	it’s yours now. It’s all that there is.
