*** J. R. R. Tolkien (1892 - 1973)


1. ALL YE JOYFUL

	Sing all ye joyful, now sing all together!
	The wind’s in the tree-top, the wind’s in the heather;
	The stars are in blossom, the moon is in flower,
	And bright are the windows of night in her tower.
	Dance all ye joyful, now dance all together!
	Soft is the grass, and let foot be like feather!
	The river is silver, the shadows are fleeting;
	Merry is May-time, and merry our meeting.
	Sigh no more pine, till the wind of the morn!
	Fall Moon! Dark be the land!
	Hush! Hush! Oak, ash and thorn!
	Hushed by all water, till dawn is at hand!


2. I SIT AND THINK

	I sit beside the fire and think of all that I have seen,
	of meadow-flowers and butterflies in summers that have been;
	Of yellow leaves and gossamer in autumns that there were,
	with morning mist and silver sun and wind upon my hair.
	I sit beside the fire and think of how the world will be
	when winter comes without a spring that I shall ever see.
	For still there are so many things that I have never seen:
	in every wood in every spring there is a different green.
	I sit beside the fire and think of people long ago,
	and people who will see a world that I shall never know.
	But all the while I sit and think of times there were before,
	I listen for returning feet and voices at the door.


3. THE ROAD GOES EVER ON

	The roads goes ever on,
	Over rock and under tree,
	By caves where never sun has shone,
	By streams that never find the sea;
	Over snow by winter sown,
	And through the merry flowers of June,
	Over grass and over stone,
	And under mountains in the moon.
	
	The road goes ever on
	Under cloud and under star,
	Yet feet that wandering have gone
	Turn at last to home afar.
	Eyes that fire and sword have seen
	And horror in the halls of stone
	Look at last on meadows green
	And trees and hills they long have known.
