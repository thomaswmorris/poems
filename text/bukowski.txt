*** Charles Bukowski (1920 - 1994)


1. BLUEBIRD

	there’s a bluebird in my heart that
	wants to get out
	but I’m too tough for him,
	I say, stay in there, I’m not going
	to let anybody see
	you.
	there’s a bluebird in my heart that
	wants to get out
	but I pour whiskey on him and inhale
	cigarette smoke
	and the whores and the bartenders
	and the grocery clerks
	never know that
	he’s
	in there.
	
	there’s a bluebird in my heart that
	wants to get out
	but I’m too tough for him,
	I say,
	stay down, do you want to mess
	me up?
	you want to screw up the
	works?
	you want to blow my book sales in
	Europe?
	there’s a bluebird in my heart that
	wants to get out
	but I’m too clever, I only let him out
	at night sometimes
	when everybody’s asleep.
	I say, I know that you’re there,
	so don’t be
	sad.
	then I put him back,
	but he’s singing a little
	in there, I haven’t quite let him
	die
	and we sleep together like
	that
	with our
	secret pact
	and it’s nice enough to
	make a man
	weep, but I don’t
	weep, do
	you?



2. TO THE WHORE WHO TOOK MY POEMS

	some say we should keep personal remorse from the
	poem,
	stay abstract, and there is some reason in this,
	but jezus;
	twelve poems gone and I don’t keep carbons and you have
	my
	paintings too, my best ones; its stifling:
	are you trying to crush me out like the rest of them?
	why didn’t you take my money? they usually do
	from the sleeping drunken pants sick in the corner.
	next time take my left arm or a fifty
	but not my poems:
	I’m not Shakespeare
	but sometime simply
	there won’t be any more, abstract or otherwise;
	there’ll always be money and whores and drunkards
	down to the last bomb,
	but as God said,
	crossing his legs,
	I see where I have made plenty of poets
	but not so very much
	poetry.
