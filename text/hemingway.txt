*** Ernest Hemingway (1899 - 1961)


1. ALONG WITH YOUTH

	A porcupine skin,
	Stiff with bad tanning,
	It must have ended somewhere.
	Stuffed horned owl
	Pompous
	Yellow eyed;
	Chuck-wills-widow on a biassed twig
	Sooted with dust.
	Piles of old magazines,
	Drawers of boy’s letters
	And the line of love
	They must have ended somewhere.
	Yesterday’s Tribune is gone
	Along with youth
	And the canoe that went to pieces on the beach
	The year of the big storm
	When the hotel burned down
	At Seney, Michigan.


2. CHAPTER HEADING

	For we have thought the longer thoughts
	       And gone the shorter way.
	And we have danced to devils’ tunes,
	       Shivering home to pray;
	To serve one master in the night,
	       Another in the day.


3. MONTPARNASSE

	There are never any suicides in the quarter among people one knows
	No successful suicides.
	A Chinese boy kills himself and is dead.
	(they continue to place his mail in the letter rack at the Dome)
	A Norwegian boy kills himself and is dead.
	(no one knows where the other Norwegian boy has gone)
	They find a model dead
	alone in bed and very dead.
	(it made almost unbearable trouble for the concierge)
	Sweet oil, the white of eggs, mustard and water, soap suds
	and stomach pumps rescue the people one knows.
	Every afternoon the people one knows can be found at the café.


4. OKLAHOMA

	All of the Indians are dead
	(a good Indian is a dead Indian)
	Or riding in motor cars--
	(the oil lands, you know, they’re all rich)
	Smoke smarts my eyes,
	Cottonwood twigs and buffalo dung
	Smoke grey in the teepee--
	(or is it myopic trachoma)
	
	The prairies are long,
	The moon rises,
	Ponies
	Drag at their pickets.
	The grass has gone brown in the summer--
	(or is it the hay crop failing)
	
	Pull an arrow out:
	If you break it
	The wound closes.
	Salt is good too
	And wood ashes.
	Pounding it throbs in the night--
	(or is it the gonorrhea)
