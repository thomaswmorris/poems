1. EPILOGUE

	Please cherish my memory--he said. I walked for thousand
	miles on end without bread and without water, along rocks and through
	thorns I walked, to fetch you bread, water and roses.
	I was always faithful to beauty. With fair mind I gave out
	all my fortune. I did not keep my lot. I am poor. With a tiny lily from
	the fields I brightened our harshest nights. Please cherish my memory.
	And forgive this last sorrow of mine:
	I would like--once again--to reap a ripe corn with the
	slender sickle moon. To stand at the threshold, to stare away
	and to chew with my front teeth the wheat
	admiring and blessing this world that I leave behind,
	admiring also Him who climbs up the hill in the
	golden rain of a sinking sun. There is a purple square patch in his
	left sleeve. It is not easy to see. It was this, more than anything else,
	that I wanted to show you.
	And probably, more than anything else, it would be worth
	remembering me for this.


2. ON A DAY IN MAY YOU LEFT ME

	On a day in May you left me, on that May day I lost you,
	in springtime you loved so well, my son, when you went upstairs,
	
	To the sun-drenched roof and looked out and your eyes never had
	their lill of drinking in the light of the whole wide world at large.
	
	With your manly voice so sweet and so warm, you recounted
	as many things as all the pebbles strewn along the seashore.
	
	My son, you told me that all these wonderful things will be ours,
	but now your light has died out, our brightness and fire are gone.


3. WHERE DID MY BOY FLY AWAY?

	Son, my flesh and blood. marrow of my bones, heart of my own heart,
	sparrow of my tiny courtyard, flower of my loneliness.
	
	Where did my boy fly away? Where’s he gone? Where’s he leaving me?
	The bird-cage is empty now, not a drop of water in the font.
	
	What ever made your dear eyes close and you are blind to my tears?
	How are you frozen in your tracks and deaf to my bitter words?
