*** John Berryman (1914 - 1972)


1. 28 JULY

	Calmly, while sat up friendlies & made noise
	delight fuller than he can ready sing
	or studiously say,
	on hearing that the year had swung to pause
	and culminated in an abundant thing,
	came his Lady’s birthday.
	
	Dogs fill daylight, doing each other ill:
	my own in love was lugged so many blocks
	we had to have a vet.
	Comes unrepentant round the lustful mongrel
	again today, glaring at her bandages & locks:
	his bark has grit.
	
	This screen-porch where my puppy suffers and 
	I swarm I hope with heartless love is now
	towards the close of day
	the scene of a vision of friendlies who withstand
	animal nature so far as to allow
	grace awhile to stay.



2. THE BALL POEM

	What is the boy now, who has lost his ball.
	What, what is he to do? I saw it go
	Merrily bouncing, down the street, and then
	Merrily over—there it is in the water!
	No use to say ‘O there are other balls’:
	An ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy
	As he stands rigid, trembling, staring down
	All his young days into the harbour where
	His ball went. I would not intrude on him,
	A dime, another ball, is worthless. Now
	He senses first responsibility
	In a world of possessions. People will take balls,
	Balls will be lost always, little boy,
	And no one buys a ball back. Money is external.
	He is learning, well behind his desperate eyes,
	The epistemology of loss, how to stand up
	Knowing what every man must one day know
	And most know many days, how to stand up
	And gradually light returns to the street,
	A whistle blows, the ball is out of sight.
	Soon part of me will explore the deep and dark
	Floor of the harbour . . I am everywhere,
	I suffer and move, my mind and my heart move
	With all that move me, under the water
	Or whistling, I am not a little boy.



3. THE DISPOSSESSED

	‘and something that . . . that is theirs--no longer ours’
	stammered to me the Italian page. A wood
	seeded & towered suddenly. I understood.--
	
	The Leading Man’s especially, and the Juvenile Lead’s,
	and the Leading Lady’s thigh that switches and warms,
	and their grimaces, and their flying arms:
	
	_our_ arms, our story. Every seat was sold.
	A crone met in a clearing sprouts a beard
	and has a tirade. Not a word we heard.
	
	Movement of stone within a woman’s heart,
	abrupt and dominant. They gesture how
	fings really are. Rarely a child sings now.
	
	My harpsichord weird as a koto drums
	_adagio_ for twilight, for the storm-worn dove
	no more de-iced, and the spidery business of love.
	
	The Juvenile Lead’s the Leader’s arm, one arm
	running the whole bole, branches, roots, (O watch)
	and the faceless fellow waving from her crotch,
	
	Stalin-unanimous! who procured a vote
	and care not use it, who have kept an eye
	and care not use it, percussive vote, clear eye.
	
	That which a captain and a weaponeer
	one day and one more day did, we did, _ach_
	we did not, _They_ did . . cam slid, the great lock
	
	lodged, and no soul of us all was near was near,--
	an evil sky (where the umbrella bloomed)
	twirled its mustaches, hissed, the ingenue fumed,
	
	poor virgin, and no hero rides. The race
	is done. Drifts through, between the cold black trunks,
	the peachblow glory of the perishing sun
	
	in empty houses where old things take place.



4. DREAM SONG 1

	Huffy Henry hid the day,
	unappeasable Henry sulked.
	I see his point,--a trying to put things over.
	It was the thought that they thought
	they could do it made Henry wicked & away.
	But he should have come out and talked.
	
	All the world like a woolen lover
	once did seem on Henry’s side.
	Then came a departure.
	Thereafter nothing fell out as it might or ought.
	I don’t see how Henry, pried
	open for all the world to see, survived.
	
	What he has now to say is a long
	wonder the world can bear & be.
	Once in a sycamore I was glad
	all at the top, and I sang.
	Hard on the land wears the strong sea
	and empty grows every bed.



5. DREAM SONG 122

	He published his girl’s bottom in staid pages
	of an old weekly. Where will next his rages
	ridiculous Henry land?
	Tranquil & chaste, de-hammocked, he descended--
	upon which note the fable should have ended--
	towards the ground, and
	
	while fable wound itself upon him thick
	and coats upon his tongue formed, white, terrific:
	he stretched out still.
	Assembled bands to do obsequious music
	at hopeless noon. He bayed before he obeyed,
	doing at last their will.
	
	This seemed perhaps one of the best of dogs
	during his barking. Many thronged & lapped
	at his delicious stone.
	Cats to a distance kept--one of their own--
	having in mind that down he lay & napped
	in the realm of whiskers & fogs.



6. DREAM SONG 13

	God bless Henry. He lived like a rat,
	with a thatch of hair on his head
	in the beginning.
	Henry was not a coward. Much.
	He never deserted anything; instead
	he stuck, when things like pity were thinning.
	
	So may be Henry was a human being.
	Let’s investigate that.
	. . . We did; okay.
	He is a human American man.
	That’s true. My lass is braking.
	My brass is aching. Come & diminish me, & map my way.
	
	God’s Henry’s enemy. We’re in business . . . Why,
	what business must be clear.
	A cornering.
	I couldn’t feel more like it.--Mr. Bones,
	as I look on the saffron sky,
	you strikes me as ornery.



7. DREAM SONG 14

	Life, friends, is boring. We must not say so.   
	After all, the sky flashes, the great sea yearns,   
	we ourselves flash and yearn,
	and moreover my mother told me as a boy   
	(repeatingly) ‘Ever to confess you’re bored   
	means you have no
	
	Inner Resources.’ I conclude now I have no   
	inner resources, because I am heavy bored.
	Peoples bore me,
	literature bores me, especially great literature,   
	Henry bores me, with his plights & gripes   
	as bad as achilles,
	
	who loves people and valiant art, which bores me.   
	And the tranquil hills, & gin, look like a drag   
	and somehow a dog
	has taken itself & its tail considerably away
	into mountains or sea or sky, leaving            
	behind: me, wag.



8. DREAM SONG 16

	Henry’s pelt was put on sundry walls
	where it did much resemble Henry and
	them persons was delighted. Especially his long & glowing tail
	by all them was admired, and visitors.
	They whistled: This is _it!_
	
	Golden, whilst your frozen daiquiris
	whir at midnight, gleams on you his fur
	& silky & black.
	Mission accomplished, pal.
	My molten yellow & moonless bag,
	drained, hangs at rest.
	
	Collect in the cold depths barracuda. Ay,
	in Sealdah Station some possessionless
	hundreds exist & die.
	The Chinese communes hum. Two daiquiris
	withdrew into a corner of the gorgeous room
	and one told the other a lie.
	
	--I doubts you did or do. De choice is lost.
	--It’s fool’s gold. But I go in for that.
	The boy & the bear
	looked at each other. Man all is tossed
	& lost with groin-wounds by the grand bulls, cat.
	William Faulkner’s where?
	
	(Frost being still around.)



9. DREAM SONG 27

	The greens of the Ganges delta foliate.
	Of heartless youth made late aware he pled:
	Brownies, please come.
	To Henry in his sparest times sometimes
	the little people spread, & did friendly things;
	then he was glad.
	
	Pleased, at the worst, except with man, he shook
	the brightest winter sun.
	All the green lives
	of the great delta, hours, hurt his migrant heart
	in a safety of the steady plane. Please, please come.
	
	My friends,--he has been known to mourn,--I’ll die;
	live you, in the most wild, kindly, green
	partly forgiving wood,
	sort of forever and all those human sings
	close not your better ears to, while good Spring
	returns with a dance and a sigh.



10. DREAM SONG 29

	There sat down, once, a thing on Henry’s heart   
	só heavy, if he had a hundred years
	& more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time   
	Henry could not make good.
	Starts again always in Henry’s ears
	the little cough somewhere, an odour, a chime.
	
	And there is another thing he has in mind   
	like a grave Sienese face a thousand years
	would fail to blur the still profiled reproach of. Ghastly,   
	with open eyes, he attends, blind.
	All the bells say: too late. This is not for tears;   
	thinking.
	
	But never did Henry, as he thought he did,
	end anyone and hacks her body up
	and hide the pieces, where they may be found.
	He knows: he went over everyone, & nobody’s missing.   
	Often he reckons, in the dawn, them up.
	Nobody is ever missing.



11. DREAM SONG 36

	The high ones die, die. They die. You look up and who’s there?
	--Easy, easy, Mr. Bones. I is on your side.
	I smell your grief.
	--I sent my grief away. I cannot care
	forever. With them all again & again I died
	and cried, and I have to live.
	--Now there _you_ exaggerate, Sah. We hafta _die_.
	That is our ’pointed task. Love & die.
	--Yes; that makes sense.
	But what makes sense between, then? What if I
	roiling & babbling & braining, brood on why and
	just sat on the fence?



12. DREAM SONG 4

	Filling her compact & delicious body
	with chicken páprika, she glanced at me
	twice.
	Fainting with interest, I hungered back
	and only the fact of her husband & four other people
	kept me from springing on her
	
	or falling at her little feet and crying
	‘You are the hottest one for years of night
	Henry’s dazed eyes
	have enjoyed, Brilliance.’ I advanced upon
	(despairing) my spumoni.--Sir Bones: is stuffed,
	de world, wif feeding girls.
	
	--Black hair, complexion Latin, jewelled eyes
	downcast . . . The slob beside her feasts . . . What wonders is
	she sitting on, over there?
	The restaurant buzzes. She might as well be on Mars.
	Where did it all go wrong? There ought to be a law against Henry.
	--Mr. Bones: there is.



13. DREAM SONG 71

	Spellbound held subtle Henry all his four
	hearers in the racket of the market
	with ancient signs, infamous characters,
	new rhythms. On the steps he was belov’d,
	hours a day, by all his four, or more,
	depending. And they paid him.
	
	It was not, so, like no one listening
	but critics famed & Henry’s pals or other
	writers at all
	chiefly in another country. No.
	He by the heart & brains & tail, because
	of their love for it, had them.
	
	Junk he said to all them open-mouth’d.
	Weather would govern. When the monsoon spread
	its floods, few came, two.
	Came a day when none, though he began
	in his accustomed way on the filthy steps
	in a crash of waters, came.



14. DREAM SONG 76

	Nothin very bad happen to me lately.
	How you explain that?--I explain that, Mr Bones,
	terms o’ your bafflin odd sobriety.
	Sober as man can get, no girls, no telephones,
	what could happen bad to Mr Bones?
	--If life is a handkerchief sandwich,
	
	in a modesty of death I join my father
	who dared so long agone leave me.
	A bullet on a concrete stoop
	close by a smothering southern sea
	spreadeagled on an island, by my knee.
	--You is from hunger, Mr Bones,
	
	I offers you this handkerchief, now set
	your left foot by my right foot,
	shoulder to shoulder, all that jazz,
	arm in arm, by the beautiful sea,
	hum a little, Mr Bones.
	--I saw nobody coming, so I went instead.



15. ELEVEN ADDRESSES TO THE LORD

	1
	
	Master of beauty, craftsman of the snowflake,
	inimitable contriver,
	endower of Earth so gorgeous & different from the boring Moon,
	thank you for such as it is my gift.
	
	I have made up a morning prayer to you
	containing with precision everything that most matters.
	‘According to Thy will’ the thing begins.
	It took me off & on two days. It does not aim at eloquence.
	
	You have come to my rescue again & again
	in my impassable, sometimes despairing years.
	You have allowed my brilliant friends to destroy themselves
	and I am still here, severely damaged, but functioning.
	
	Unknowable, as I am unknown to my guinea pigs:
	how can I ‘love’ you?
	I only as far as gratitude & awe
	confidently & absolutely go.
	
	I have no idea whether we live again.
	It doesn’t seem likely
	from either the scientific or the philosophical point of view
	but certainly all things are possible to you,
	
	and I believe as fixedly in the Resurrection-appearances to Peter & to Paul
	as I believe I sit in this blue chair.
	Only that may have been a special case
	to establish their initiatory faith.
	
	Whatever your end may be, accept my amazement.
	May I stand until death forever at attention
	for any your least instruction or enlightenment.
	I even feel sure you will assist me again, Master of insight & beauty.
	
	
	2
	
	Holy, as I suppose I dare to call you
	without pretending to know anything about you
	but infinite capacity everywhere & always
	& in particular certain goodness to me.
	
	Yours is the crumpling, to my sister-in-law terrifying thunder,
	yours the candelabra buds sticky in Spring,
	Christ’s mercy,
	the gloomy wisdom of godless Freud:
	
	yours the lost souls in ill-attended wards,
	those agonized thro’ the world
	It this instant of time, all evil men,
	Belsen, Omaha Beach,--
	
	incomprehensible to man your ways.
	May be the Devil after all exists.
	‘I don’t try to reconcile anything’ said the poet at eighty,
	‘This is a damned strange world.’
	
	Man is ruining the pleasant earth & man.
	What at last, my Lord, will you allow?
	Postpone till after my children’s deaths your doom
	if it be thy ineffable, inevitable will.
	
	I say ‘Thy kingdom come’, it means nothing to me.
	Hast Thou prepared astonishments for man?
	One sudden Coming? Many so believe.
	So not, without knowing anything, do I.
	
	
	3
	
	Sole watchman of the flying stars, guard me
	against my flicker of impulse lust: teach me
	to see them as sisters & daughters. Sustain
	my grand endeavours: husbandship & crafting.
	
	Forsake me not when my wild hours come;
	grant me sleep nightly, grace soften my dreams;
	achieve in me patience till the thing be done,
	a careful view of my achievement come.
	
	Make me from time to time the gift of the shoulder.
	When all hurt nerves whine shut away the whiskey.
	Empty my heart toward Thee.
	Let me pace without fear the common path of death.
	
	Cross am I sometimes with my little daughter:
	fill her eyes with tears. Forgive me, Lord.
	Unite my various soul,
	sole watchman of the wide & single stars.
	
	
	4
	
	If I say Thy name, art Thou there? It may be so.
	Thou art not absent-minded, as I am.
	I am so much so I had to give up driving.
	You attend, I feel, to the matters of man.
	
	Across the ages certain blessings swarm,
	horrors accumulate, the best men fail:
	Socrates, Lincoln, Christ mysterious.
	Who can search Thee out?
	
	except Isaiah & Pascal, who saw.
	I dare not ask that vision, though a piece of it
	at last in crisis was vouchsafèd me.
	I altered then for good, to become yours.
	
	Caretaker! take care, for we run in straits.
	Daily, by night, we walk naked to storm,
	some threat of wholesale loss, to ruinous fear.
	Gift us with long cloaks & adrenalin.
	
	Who haunt the avenues of Angkor Wat
	recalling all that prayer, that glory dispersed,
	haunt me at the corner of Fifth & Hennepin.
	Shield & fresh fountain! Manifester! Even mine.
	
	
	5
	
	Holy, & holy. The damned are said to say
	‘We never thought we would come into this place.’
	I’m fairly clear, my Friend, there’s no such place
	ordained for inappropriate & evil man.
	
	Surely they fall dull, & forget. We too,
	the more or less just, I feel fall asleep
	dreamless forever while the worlds hurl out.
	Rest may be your ultimate gift.
	
	Rest or transfiguration! come & come
	whenever Thou wilt. My daughter & my son
	fend will without me, when my work is done
	in Your opinion.
	
	Strengthen my widow, let her dream on me
	thro’ tranquil hours less & down to less.
	Abrupt elsewhere her heart, I sharply hope.
	I leave her in wise Hands.
	
	
	6
	
	Under new management, Your Majesty:
	Thine. I have solo’d mine since childhood, since
	my father’s suicide when I was twelve
	blew out my most bright candle faith, and look at me.
	
	I served at Mass six dawns a week from five,
	adoring Father Boniface & you,
	memorizing the Latin he explained.
	Mostly we worked alone. One or two women.
	
	Then my poor father frantic. Confusions & afflictions
	followed my days. Wives left me.
	Bankrupt I closed my doors. You pierced the roof
	twice & again. Finally you opened my eyes.
	
	My double nature fused in that point of time
	three weeks ago day before yesterday.
	Now, brooding thro’ a history of the early Church,
	I identify with everybody, even the heresiarchs.
	
	
	7
	
	After a Stoic, a Peripatetic, a Pythagorean,
	Justin Martyr studied the words of the Saviour,
	finding them short, precise, terrible, & full of refreshment.
	I am tickled to learn this.
	
	Let one day desolate Sherry, fair, thin, tall,
	at 29 today her life the Sahara Desert,
	who has never once enjoyed a significant relation,
	so find His lightning words.
	
	
	_A Prayer for the Self_
	
	Who am I worthless that You spent such pains
	and take may pains again?
	I do not understand; but I believe.
	Jonquils respond with wit to the teasing breeze.
	
	Induct me down my secrets. Stiffen this heart
	to stand their horrifying cries, O cushion
	the first the second shocks, will to a halt
	in mid-air there demons who would be at me.
	
	May fade before, sweet morning on sweet morning,
	I wake my dreams, my fan-mail go astray,
	and do me little goods I have not thought of,
	ingenious & beneficial Father.
	
	Ease in their passing my beloved friends,
	all others too I have cared for in a travelling life,
	anyone anywhere indeed. Lift up
	sober toward truth a scared self-estimate.
	
	
	9
	
	Surprise me on some ordinary day
	with a blessing gratuitous. Even I’ve done good
	beyond their expectations. What count we then
	upon Your bounty?
	
	Interminable: an old theologian
	asserts that even to say You exist is misleading.
	Uh-huh. I buy that Second-century fellow.
	I press his withered glorifying hand.
	
	You certainly do not as I exist,
	impersonating as well the meteorite
	& flaring in your sun your waterfall
	or blind in caves pallid fishes.
	
	Bear in mind me, Who have forgotten nothing,
	& Who continues. I may not foreknow
	& fail much to remember. You sustain
	imperial desuetudes, at the kerb a widow.
	
	
	10
	
	Fearful I peer upon the mountain path
	where once Your shadow passed, Limner of the clouds
	up their phantastic guesses. I am afraid,
	I never until now confessed.
	
	I fell back in love with you, Father, for two reasons:
	You were good to me, & a delicious author,
	rational & passionate. Come on me again,
	as twice you came to Azarias & Misael.
	
	President of the brethren, our mild assemblies
	inspire, & bother the priest not to be dull;
	keep us week-long in order; love my children,
	my mother far & ill, far brother, my spouse.
	
	Oil all my turbulence as at Thy dictation
	I sweat out my wayward works.
	Father Hopkins said the only true literary critic is Christ.
	Let me lie down exhausted, content with that.
	
	
	11
	
	Germanicus leapt upon the wild lion in Smyrna,
	wishing to pass quickly from a lawless life.
	The crowd shook the stadium.
	The proconsul marvelled.
	
	‘Eighty & six years have I been his servant,
	and he has done me no harm.
	How can I blaspheme my King who saved me?’
	Polycarp, John’s pupil, facing the fire.
	
	Make too me acceptable at the end of time
	in my degree, which then Thou wilt award.
	Cancer, senility, mania,
	I pray I may be ready with my witness.



16. FARE WELL

	Motions of waking trouble winter air,
	I wonder, and his face as it were forms
	Solemn, canorous, under the howled alarms,--
	The eyes shadowed and shut.
	Certainly for this sort of thing it is very late,
	I shudder, while my love longs and I pour
	My bright eyes towards the moving shadow . . . where?
	Out, like a plucked gut
	
	What has been taken away will not return,
	I take it, whether upon the crouch of night
	Or for my mountain need to share a morning’s light,--
	No! I am alone.
	What has been taken away should not have been shown,
	I complain, torturing, and then withdrawn.
	After so long, can I still long so and burn,
	Imperishable son?
	
	O easy the phoenix in the tree of the heart,
	Each in its time, his twigs and spices fixes
	To make a last nest, and marvellously relaxes,--
	Out of the fire, weak peep! . . .
	Father I fought for Mother, sleep where you sleep!
	I slip into a snowbed with no hurt
	Where warm will warm be warm enough to part
	Us. As I sink, I weep.



17. FROM JOB

	_Job:_
	
	Perish the day’s fire in where I was born, and that
	 night’s joy crying ‘A boy!’
	That day let God enquire not down for, no brightness
	 burn there,
	But a dark of midnight claim, a black cloud seize it
	 wholly,
	Let all that stains & shrouds terrify that day.
	Disjoin from its fellow days it, exiled from the toil of
	 the months.
	Stony that night turn, joyless, empty of all song;
	Enchanters mark it curst, whose baleful power calls up
	 Leviathan;
	Its twilight stars be darkt, unseen the eyelids of its dawn;
	For it shut not the hole of my womb, but let me out to
	 trouble.
	
	Why died not I from the womb, incht-out still-born,
	Or fail aborted, carelessly buried, like children who never saw light?
	Why my father’s knee accepting, breasts giving me suck,--
	When now I should have lain still, and slept, and slept at rest,
	With kings and the world’s counsellors, who built up ruins to their glory,
	With princes heavy with gold, who houses filled with silver;
	Where the wicked cease from raging, where the exhausted rest,
	Where prisoners glad together hear not the voice of the guard,
	Where small & great are the same, and the slave free from a master.
	Wherefore is light to the miserable, wherefore living to the bitter
	Who long for a death unforthcoming, and dig for it like treasure,
	Whose hearts leap at a mound, a small mound, strain toward a grave,
	Whose way is lockt off, who are hedged in by God himself?
	To me moans came for food, my roars poured forth like drink.
	I fear a fear: it comes. That which I dread comes to me.
	No ease was mine, no quiet, no rest; yet trouble came.
	
	
	_Eliphass:_
	
	Will it do if we speak to you? for who can here be still?
	Lo, you admonisht many, and to the frail sprang support,
	Your speech arrested those falling, you stiffened the folding knees.
	Now it comes on, and you faint; touches you, fear.
	Is not good fear your boldness, this your integrity hope?
	Who perished ever,--remember?--pure? Where were the good destroyed?
	Evil ones I have seen pluckt up, reaping an empty house,
	Their children cast away justiceless in the gates courts;
	I have seen a sowing of evil, until the wind-blast of God.
	The old hoarse lions roar, assailed, and the young lions teeth are broken,
	And starve do old & young, and the lady’s cubs are crusht forth.
	
	Now secretly a word came, and I gathered a little of it,
	In piecemeal visions of the night, when deep sleep takes men;
	Entered me fear, and trembling, and all my bones shook,
	Before my face a spirit passed, my head’s hair shuddered,
	It stood still, no part of that appearance clear to me,
	A form was before my eyes, in silence, and I heard a voice:
	(_word unclear_) men can be just before God? Can a man be pure as his maker?
	Who can place trust in His servants? His angels fail to you;
	Then what in those whose houses are mud, whose foundations are mud.
	
	Who crunch like a moth, between the dawn and evening,
	Who are shattered, so, and unseen perish for ever.
	Rage is the foolish man’s enemy, resentment doubles his woe;
	I have seen him taking root, and curst his house suddenly,
	For his children are unsafe, and suffer in the gate, unaided.
	Their harvest any hungry eat--even from thorns, and the snare gapes.
	From the dust woe comes not, nor shoots from the ground.
	But man is born to trouble, as the angels fly off.
	Were it mine, I would seek Shaddai and put the case there,
	Who ancient enigmatic great deeds does, marvellous at, numberless,
	Rain-donor here, prolific of waters elsewhere, anywhere,
	Place-alterer, lifting up the low, restoring the mourning,
	Who moves on the crafty’s schemes, emptying their hands,
	Who takes the wise in their own devices, the wily’s counsels blows away;
	Darkness at noon abruptly they meet, and grope, and grope:
	The Good from their mouths he snatches, the poor from their power,
	So that the poor have hope, and evil shuts its mouth.
	
	Lo, happy a man whom God corrects, who Shaddai’s training takes;
	For first He hurts, then heals; wounds, and His hands make whole;
	Out from six woes He saves you,--seven, and He saves;
	In famine keeps you from dying, in war from the sword’s power.
	From spells you sheltered, scathless when demons come:
	At them and hunger laugh, look upon beasts without fear,
	For you be in league with the satyrs of the fields, at peace with the wild beasts.
	And your tent shall be at peace, your home-place whole.
	Many your seed, in your confidence, your offspring like the grass.
	You shall die unimpaired, & old, as a shock of corn in its season.
	So: here is our knowing, & truth, & proven: hear it in your heart.



18. FROM THE BLACK BOOK

	_not him_
	
	Grandfather, sleepless in a room upstairs,
	Seldom came down; so when they tript him down
	We wept. The blind light sang about his ears,
	Later we heard. Brother had pull. In pairs
	He, some, slept upon stone.
	Later they stamped him down in mud.
	The windlass drew him silly & odd-eyed, blood
	Broke from his ears before they quit.
	Before they trucked him home they cleaned him up somewhat.
	
	Only the loose eyes’ glaze they could not clean
	And soon he died. He howled a night and shook
	Our teeth before the end; we breathed again
	When he stopt. Abraham, what we have seen
	Write, I beg, in your Book.
	No more the solemn and high bells
	Call to our pall; we crawl or gibber; Hell’s
	Irritable & treacherous
	Despairs here here (not him) reach now to shatter us.

	_Luftmenschen_ dream, the men who live on air,
	Of other values, in the blackness watching
	Peaceful for gangs or a quick raid,
	The ghetto nods a mortal head
	Soundless but for a scurry, a sigh, retching,--
	No moan of generation fear.
	Hands hold each other limper
	While the moon lengthens on the sliding river.
	
	Prolong the woolen night--Solomon sang--
	And never the soul with its own revenge encumber
	But like a cry of cranes dies out,
	Ecstatic, faint, a moment float--
	ing, fying soul, or flares like August timber
	In wild woe vanishing.
	Blue grows from grey, towards slaughter.
	(An Ashkenazi genius stoned Ivan; a sculptor.)
	
	“Boleslaus brought us here, surnamed the Good,
	Whose dust rolls nearly seven hundred years
	Towards Sirius: we thank that King
	As for the ledge whereto we cling,
	Night in the caves under the ruins; stars,
	Armbands come off, for which we could
	Be glad but the black troops gather.”
	So those who kneel in the paling sky and shiver.
	
	Dawn like a rose unfolds--flower of parks--
	Alleys of limetrees, villas, ponds, a palace
	Down a deserted riverbed,
	The Lazienki Gardens’ pride,
	Monument to a king able and callous
	Who far Vienna from the Turks
	Bloodily did deliver.
	For foreigners, now, a sort of theatre.
	
	One officer in black demarches here
	Cupshot, torn collar by a bitch unwilling
	Native & blonde through the debauch
	That kept him all night from his couch,
	Hurts his head and from the others’ howling
	Drove him out for morning air.
	Brooding over the water
	He reddens suddenly. He went back & shot her.
	
	
	_the will_
	
	A frail vague man, in whom our senses ached
	With nothing, began to whisper with himself
	At line-up, from the rear,--
	We trembled for him,--shook the scald that caked
	His skull, totting up phantoms none could solve,
	Fag-end of a career.
	
	(Shadowless in a cairn, four lights. Farewell,
	The legacy trots off,
	A swimming moment of the stiff’s desire
	Such decades since. Or nothing trots to tell
	Intestate once with love
	Pain brain stood up a bit out of time’s mire.)
	He scrambled one night out
	And dodged between their lights far to the wire,
	Where he lodged. I suppose he crisped, dying in fire;
	A shot or so, a shout;
	But certainly, lifting our scalps, well beyond fear,
	He suddenly sang, sang, hanging on the wire.
	
	
	_the waiting_
	
	Nearer, my heart, to me . . . My cigarette
	Endures an apotheosis; I feel
	More for the grey twirl than I mull or whet
	God’s promise . . . probably the butt is real.
	Now I seem less so. Than tissue & ash
	I am more indistinct, than fire and weed
	Yielding to fire, as fire to the weed’s trash:
	Do pins & feathers kill? Can a root bleed?
	Master my heart will nothing to my side?
	Otherwhere, neither broods nor aches for me
	Regitive by the iron door unterrified
	Foully it leans. That hole, my mystery,
	
	Which once its bolt, the muscle of their State,
	Opened to drop me in, cannot keep shut!
	Lancet intensities I anticipate!
	Feathery movement twires about my thought!
	
	The frontier posts, disfigured sphincters, spill
	Invaders home; heart through the ribs returns;
	How corn & wine return, transfigured, fill
	Sleepy lands, our land. Ice on my brow burns,
	
	Ebbing, blackfellow-dull, when the bolt shoots
	Over the tigerish flood may I soar steady
	Whither the latched starless & heartless roots
	O need blindly night. I am almost ready--



19. HE STARED AT RUIN

	He stared at ruin. Ruin stared straight back.
	He thought they was old friends. He felt on the stair
	where her father found them bare
	they became familiar. When the papers were lost
	rich with pals’ secrets, he thought he had the knack
	of ruin. Their paths crossed
	
	and once they crossed in jail; they crossed in bed;
	and over an unsigned letter their eyes met,
	and in an Asian city
	directionless & lurching at two & three,
	and trembling to a telephone’s fresh threat,
	and when some wired his head
	
	to reach a wrong opinion, ‘Epileptic’
	But he noted now that: they were not old friends.
	He did not know this one.
	This one was a stranger, come to make amends
	for all the imposters, and to make it stick.
	Henry nodded, un-.



20. INNOCENT

	Cats’ eyes could see a flub of blood.
	Hm. Not her eyes whose pain
	Arched in the dark by the roadside.
	No cats, nothing. She tried, & tried,
	Troubling not Christ’s night in vain.
	
	Scum of the moon caught on her chin,
	Harmless & sickle moon, a slack
	Drink-dull passer noticed her,
	To gather the beggar out of the blur
	Into his wagon, sick, and track.
	
	The soft flesh melted from the bones
	Of the child born dead, for days & days
	In the wood’s edge. Birds, nothing came.
	Bones go. All is the same, the same,--
	Except our envy O wintry praise!



21. SONNET

	Sometimes the night echoes to prideless wailing
	Low as I hunch home late and fever-tired,
	Near you not, nearing the sharer I desired,
	Toward whom till now I sailed back . . . but that sailing
	Yaws, from the cabin orders like a failing
	Dribble, the stores disordered and then fired
	Skid wild, the men are glaring, the mate has wired
	_Hopeless:_ Locked in, and humming, the Captain’s nailing
	A false log to the lurching table. Lies
	And passion sing in the cabin on the voyage home,
	The burgee should fly Jolly Roger: wind
	Madness like the tackle of a crane (outcries
	Ascend) around to heave him from the foam
	Irresponsible, since all the stars rain blind.



22. SURVIVING LOVE

	The clapper hovers, but why run so hard?
	What he wants, has,
	--more than will make him ease;
	No god calls down,--he’s not been on his knees
	This man, for years, and he is off his guard.
	What then does he dream of
	Sweating through day?--Surviving love.
	
	Cold he knows he comes, once to the dark,
	All that waste of cold, leaving all cold
	Behind him hearts, forgotten when he’s tolled,
	His books are split and sold, the pencil mark
	He made erased, his wife
	Gone brave and quick to her new life.
	
	And so he spins to find out something warm
	To think on when the glaze fastens his eyes
	And he begins to freeze. He slows and tries
	To hear a promise: ‘After, after your storm
	I will grieve and remember,
	Miss you and be warm and remember.’
	
	But really nothing replies to the poor man,
	He never hears this, or the voice he hears
	(He thinks) he loses ah when next appears
	The hood of the bell, seeing which he began.
	His skull rings with his end,
	He runs on, love for love.



23. WHOLLY FAIL

	Sir Partofall, our Best, O the Physicist is
	(Wizards of Oak Ridge and Los Alamos)
	Your questrist foxing up a drug that may
	Or may not, who knows . . . so (but not a word)
	“A livens wife’s and mother’s and son’s coffee
	His own, therewith one holy night; next day
	None descends, if the silence in the house
	Is unusual and complete, like a curtain,
	He will know (or will not, will he) he has failed.
	Such a good Doctor nominate a beast
	Or madman: if he reached the Chair alive,
	O lucky Doctor. Let us hang our faith
	--To master the power of the grave, much; more,
	The power to unwit; most, curst and clouded shore,
	The power of despair.--
	Instead on him on to the Grail, throw the State there
	To see what he can find
	Useful for mankind,
	Useful although uncertain:
	Where Partsusall, transfigured, white with joy,
	Smiles thro’ the blast and fiery wind spreading out from zero--



24. WINTER LANDSCAPE

	The three men coming down the winter hill
	In brown, with tall poles and a pack of hounds
	At heel, through the arrangement of the trees,
	Past the five figures at the burning straw,
	Returning cold and silent to their town,
	
	Returning to the drifted snow, the rink
	Lively with children, to the older men,
	The long companions they can never reach,
	The blue light, men with ladders, by the church
	The sledge and shadow in the twilit street,
	
	Are not aware that in the sandy time
	To come, the evil waste of history
	Outstretched, they will be seen upon the brow
	Of that same hill: when all their company
	Will have been irrecoverably lost,
	
	These men, this particular three in brown
	Witnessed by birds will keep the scene and say
	By their configuration with the trees,
	The small bridge, the red houses and the fire,
	What place, what time, what morning occasion
	
	Sent them into the wood, a pack of hounds
	At heel and the tall poles upon their shoulders,
	Thence to return as now we see them and
	Ankle-deep in snow down the winter hill
	Descend, while three birds watch and the fourth flies.
