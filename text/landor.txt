*** Walter Savage Landor (1775 - 1864)


1. ABSENCE

	HERE, ever since you went abroad,
	If there be change no change I see:
	I only walk our wonted road,
	The road is only walk’d by me.

	Yes; I forgot; a change there is--
	Was it of that you bade me tell?
	I catch at times, at times I miss
	The sight, the tone, I know so well.

	Only two months since you stood here?
	Two shortest months? Then tell me why
	Voices are harsher than they were,
	And tears are longer ere they dry.



2. IANTHE’S QUESTION

	‘Do you remember me? or are you proud?’
	Lightly advancing thro’ her star-trimm’d crowd,
	Ianthe said, and look’d into my eyes.
	‘A yes, a yes to both: for Memory
	Where you but once have been must ever be,
	And at your voice Pride from his throne must rise.’



3. THE MAID’S LAMENT

	I loved him not; and yet now he is gone
	I feel I am alone.
	I check’d him while he spoke; yet could he speak,
	Alas! I would not check.
	For reasons not to love him once I sought,
	And wearied all my thought
	To vex myself and him: I now would give
	My love, could he but live
	Who lately lived for me, and when he found
	‘Twas vain, in holy ground
	He hid his face amid the shades of death.
	I waste for him my breath
	Who wasted his for me: but mine returns,
	And this lorn bosom burns
	With stifling heat, heaving it up in sleep,
	And waking me to weep
	Tears that had melted his soft heart: for years
	Wept he as bitter tears.
	_Merciful God!_ such was his latest prayer,
	_These may she never share!_
	Quieter is his breath, his breast more cold,
	Than daisies in the mould,
	Where children spell, athwart the churchyard gate,
	His name and life’s brief date.
	Pray for him, gentle souls, whoe’er you be,
	And oh! pray too for me!



4. ROSE AYLMER

	Ah, what avails the sceptred race,
	Ah, what the form divine!
	What every virtue, every grace!
	Rose Aylmer, all were thine.
	Rose Aylmer, whom these wakeful eyes
	May weep, but never see,
	A night of memories and of sighs
	I consecrate to thee.
