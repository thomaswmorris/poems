*** Wendell Berry (1934 - )


1. BEFORE DARK

	From the porch at dusk I watched
	a kingfisher wild in flight
	he could only have made for joy.
	
	He came down the river, splashing
	against the water’s dimming face
	like a skipped rock, passing
	
	on down out of sight. And still
	I could hear the splashes
	farther and farther away
	
	as it grew darker. He came back
	the same way, dusky as his shadow,
	sudden beyond the willows.
	
	The splashes went on out of hearing.
	It was dark then. Somewhere
	the night had accommodated him
	
	--at the place he was headed for
	or where, led by his delight,
	he came.


2. THE BURIAL OF THE OLD

	The old, whose bodies encrust their lives,
	die, and that is well.
	They unhinder what has struggled in them.
	
	The light, painfully loved, that narrowed
	and darkened in their minds
	becomes again the sky.
	
	The young, who have looked on dying,
	turn back to the world, grown strangely
	alert to each other’s bodies.


3. THE COUNTRY OF MARRIAGE

	I
	
	I dream of you walking at night along the streams 
	of the country of my birth, warm blooms and the nightsongs 
	of birds opening around you as you walk. 
	You are holding in your body the dark seed of my sleep. 
	
	
	II
	
	This comes after silence. Was it something I said 
	that bound me to you, some mere promise 
	or, worse, the fear of loneliness and death? 
	A man lost in the woods in the dark, I stood 
	still and said nothing. And then there rose in me, 
	like the earth’s empowering brew rising 
	in root and branch, the words of a dream of you 
	I did not know I had dreamed. I was a wanderer 
	who feels the solace of his native land 
	under his feet again and moving in his blood. 
	I went on, blind and faithful. Where I stepped 
	my track was there to steady me. It was no abyss 
	that lay before me, but only the level ground. 
	
	
	III
	
	Sometimes our life reminds me 
	of a forest in which there is a graceful clearing 
	and in that opening a house, 
	an orchard and garden, 
	comfortable shades, and flowers 
	red and yellow in the sun, a pattern 
	made in the light for the light to return to. 
	The forest is mostly dark, its ways 
	to be made anew day after day, the dark 
	richer than the light and more blessed, 
	provided we stay brave 
	enough to keep on going in. 
	
	
	IV
	
	How many times have I come to you out of my head 
	with joy, if ever a man was, 
	for to approach you I have given up the light 
	and all directions. I come to you 
	lost, wholly trusting as a man who goes 
	into the forest unarmed. It is as though I descend 
	slowly earthward out of the air. I rest in peace 
	in you, when I arrive at last. 
	
	
	V
	
	Our bond is no little economy based on the exchange 
	of my love and work for yours, so much for so much 
	of an expendable fund. We don’t know what its limits are-- 
	that puts us in the dark. We are more together 
	than we know, how else could we keep on discovering 
	we are more together than we thought? 
	You are the known way leading always to the unknown, 
	and you are the known place to which the unknown is always 
	leading me back. More blessed in you than I know, 
	I possess nothing worthy to give you, nothing 
	not belittled by my saying that I possess it. 
	Even an hour of love is a moral predicament, a blessing 
	a man may be hard up to be worthy of. He can only 
	accept it, as a plant accepts from all the bounty of the light 
	enough to live, and then accepts the dark, 
	passing unencumbered back to the earth, as I 
	have fallen tine and again from the great strength 
	of my desire, helpless, into your arms. 
	
	
	VI
	
	What I am learning to give you is my death 
	to set you free of me, and me from myself 
	into the dark and the new light. Like the water 
	of a deep stream, love is always too much. We 
	did not make it. Though we drink till we burst 
	we cannot have it all, or want it all. 
	In its abundance it survives our thirst. 
	In the evening we come down to the shore 
	to drink our fill, and sleep, while it 
	flows through the regions of the dark. 
	It does not hold us, except we keep returning 
	to its rich waters thirsty. We enter, 
	willing to die, into the commonwealth of its joy. 
	
	
	VII
	
	I give you what is unbounded, passing from dark to dark, 
	containing darkness: a night of rain, an early morning. 
	I give you the life I have let live for the love of you: 
	a clump of orange-blooming weeds beside the road, 
	the young orchard waiting in the snow, our own life 
	that we have planted in the ground, as I 
	have planted mine in you. I give you my love for all 
	beautiful and honest women that you gather to yourself 
	again and again, and satisfy--and this poem, 
	no more mine than any man’s who has loved a woman.


4. THE COUNTRY TOWN IN EARLY SUMMER MORNING

	The town has grown here, angular
	and white on its hill pelted
	with thickets, in the passage
	of a darkness; the houses, two-ranked,
	peristyle of morning’s long shade
	a thing of nature, made
	deviously in all the black
	filled hollows of its time, its
	history of acts and briars.
	It rose up with the first
	singing and light to surprise
	its dreamers. Among declivities
	and groves of the inert hill,
	channeled and splined by the
	seasonal escapade of streams,
	where its graves and garbage
	choke the ravines, old shoes
	in a milling of stones commemorate
	the town laid waste. By morning’s
	instantaneous contrivance, mottled
	shade and light, the day upholds
	carved orange lilies in a calm
	dreamers no longer dream but know.


5. THE DEAD CALF

	Dead at the pasture edge,
	his head is without eyes, becalmed
	on the grass. There was no escaping
	the heaviness that came on him,
	the darkness that rose
	under his belly as though he stood
	in a black sucking pool.
	Earth’s weight grew in him,
	and he lay down. As he died
	a great bird took his eyes.
	
	Where is the horror in it?
	Not in him, for he came to it
	as a shadow into the night.
	It was nameless and familiar.
	He was fitted to it. In me
	is where the horror is. In my mind
	he does not yield. I cannot believe
	the deep peace that has come to him.
	I am afraid that where the light
	is torn there is a wound.
	There is a darkness in the soul
	that loves the eyes. There is a light
	in the mind that sees only light
	and will not enter the darkness.
	
	But I would have a darkness
	in my mind like the dark
	the dead calf makes for a time
	on the grass where he lies, and will make
	in the earth as he is carried down.
	May all dead things lie down in me
	and be at peace, as in the ground.


6. ELEGY

	I
	
	All day our eyes could find no resting place.
	Over a flood of snow sight came back
	Empty to the mind. The sun
	In a shutter of clouds, light
	Staggered down the fall of snow.
	All circling surfaces of earth were white.
	No shape or shadow moved the flight
	Of winter birds. Snow held earth its silence.
	We could pick no birdsong from the wind.
	At nightfall our father turned his eyes away.
	It was this storm of silence shook out his ghost.
	
	
	II
	
	We sleep; he only wakes
	Who is unshapen in a night of snow.
	His shadow in the shadow of the earth,
	Moves the dark to wholeness.
	We watch beside his body here, his image
	Shape of silence in the room.
	
	
	III
	
				Sifting
	Down the wind the winter rain
	Spirals about the town
	And the church hill’s jut of stones.


7. ENEMIES

	If you are not to become a monster, 
	you must care what they think. 
	If you care what they think, 
	
	how will you not hate them, 
	and so become a monster 
	of the opposite kind? From where then 
	
	is love to come—love for your enemy 
	that is the way of liberty? 
	From forgiveness. Forgiven, they go 
	
	free of you, and you of them; 
	they are to you as sunlight 
	on a green branch. You must not 
	
	think of them again, except 
	as monsters like yourself, 
	pitiable because unforgiving.


8. GRACE

	The woods is shining this morning.
	Red, gold and green, the leaves
	lie on the ground, or fall,
	or hang full of light in the air still.
	Perfect in its rise and in its fall, it takes
	the place it has been coming to forever.
	It has not hastened here, or lagged.
	See how surely it has sought itself,
	its roots passing lordly through the earth
	See how without confusion it is
	all that it is, and how flawless
	its grace is. Running or walking, the way
	is the same. Be still. Be still.
	“He moves your bones, and the way is clear.”


9. THE HABIT OF WAKING

	_Do you not know, O speech, how
	the buds beneath you are folded?_
	
	I
	
	Snow, melting, leaves the landscape pied;
	waking, in vacancy like a dream, withdraws
	the cloth of sleep; the false earth of winter
	recedes, is dried, on the dead grass, the merging green;
	
	white, unthawed, along the drains, marks
	the conjectural forking, down-gathering
	of a river. Bulked at troughs, cattle feed
	in the provisional enclosure of the farmer’s mind.
	
	Flocks birth in the female barns. Green
	fevers in the black woods. The wind, now,
	makes purpose of its accidents, becoming mild;
	the weather’s dispassionate benevolence,
	
	returning, stirs the mind again
	to the ancient perilous advancement. Stripped
	of the old cumulus of growths, cessations,
	dreams, the house completes its seasonal closure,
	
	having forestalled the winter, sheltering
	as needful, its divisive entrances armed
	against cold; having held a compacted light
	tokening, in excess of necessity, joy:
	
	at the window’s interior the scarlet bloom
	of tulips has burned and glowed in the reflected
	light of snow. The inward and outward house,
	containment of that gentleness, and its defense,
	is continent of the intellect, venturing
	
	with its dreams into the weather’s judgment.
	The young spring, returning, turns
	the transparency of windows outward;
	forked cherry branches figure the barren glass,
	
	unleaved. We prepare this vacancy a little
	for the coming of spring; the tree is cut back
	for a fuller blooming, heavier fruit.
	This waking wakes, advances to a new
	
	envisionment, the old renewal of desire.
	The mind lays claim to its summer,
	dreams a perfect ripening, weighted harvest,
	in the sun’s cruel beneficence, foreshadowing
	
	harsher culminations, sterner quittances.
	Waking is a leaf, a hand, a light--envisioning
	white hands among foliage, red fruit, gathering.
	
	
	II
	
	It’s a weather of engines,
	also, into which spring comes
	--among the sounds of traffic
	at the roadside, where bloom
	the yellow first jonquils;
	a drift of snow melted there
	a week ago--now it’s
	just the memory of snow
	draws back from the yellow
	cup-lips. The traffic goes by,
	the engines unwearying
	as weather, gathering places,
	tires pelting the asphalt,
	moving to destinations
	each way; the jonquils
	bloom in their silence
	and yellow. It’s the wind
	that stirs them, the wind at large
	over the hill now becoming
	green under the heavy weather
	of March and the weather of engines;
	the hill leans back to the root
	of the wind, the flowerheads
	lean away; having come a long
	journey, unbroken, the wind
	is voluble and strong, taking
	its hurdles, surrounding the
	stolid fenceposts along the roadway,
	crossing the stream of traffic
	which crosses the wind.
	
	The color of the jonquils
	has to do with the weather
	of March--a cool yellow,
	receptive of the smallest
	light, the frailest warmth;
	and has to do, by its silence,
	purely, with the sounds
	of engines--acceptive; the plant
	dares its bloom above ground
	to be lovely, or trampled.
	The life in it is its motive.
	
	Wakened and touched
	by the thin yellow of jonquils,
	the house stands in the cross-grain
	of wind and the roadway, in transversed
	distances comprehending cities
	--approached, approaching.
	The house stands in a vision
	of journeys bearing recognitions
	toward it; and in all degrees
	recognizes and is recognized
	by who comes to it, and who passes.
	The house and the city, though
	the bulk of a continent balks
	between them, have to do
	with one another; the knowledge
	of one is a knowledge of the other,
	acknowledges the other.
	
	In the same dark wherein
	the periled jonquils remain
	--and the traffic beats on
	between cities, continuing
	into the tunnel of headlights
	parting the embankments, entering
	distance as by the force of light
	blooming, entering the violable
	blossoming of the desire
	of the place of arrival or the place
	of sleep--a dark craft, vaulting
	its possible crash, arches
	its mathematic trajectory
	over the house, its lights
	lighted, a tentative constellation
	marking one height of the sky.
	But it measures
	one depth of darkness also,
	and circumscribes the paltry known;
	its course is a severance
	above which lights are meaningless.
	And outward from that fight hunt
	the made moons of our darkness
	and desire, their circuits
	ticking and aware, leaning
	to the void; our listening strains
	into the galaxial silence
	beyond expectancy, unmeaning,
	wishing to hear.
	
	And in the selfsame dark
	the creeks, in the aftermath
	of the first heavy rains,
	are audible to the hilltop
	--the wash of sound entering
	the consciousness of walls.
	Among the soaked grasses
	along the down-meaning streams
	in the weather of engines
	the old singing of the frogs
	begins. The dark breeds
	dawn, a deeper melting.


10. THE HANDING DOWN

	I. _The Conversation_
	
	Speaker and hearer, words
	making a passage between them,
	begin a community.
	
			Two minds
	
	in succession, grandfather
	and grandson, they sit and talk
	on the enclosed porch,
	
	looking out at the town, which
	takes its origin in their talk
	and is carried forward.
	
	
	Their conversation has
	no pattern of its own,
	but alludes casually
	
	to a shaped knowledge
	in the minds of the two men
	who love each other.
	
	The quietness of knowing in common
	is half of it. Silences come into it
	easily, and break it
	
	while the old man thinks
	or concentrates on his pipe
	and the strong smoke
	
	climbs over the brim of his hat.
	He has lived a long time.
	He has seen the changes of times
	
	and grown used to the world
	again. Having been wakeful so long,
	the loser of so many years,
	
	his mind moves back and forth,
	sorting and counting,
	among all he knows.
	
	His memory has become huge,
	and surrounds him,
	and fills his silences.
	
	He lifts his head
	and speaks of an old day
	that amuses him or grieves him
	
	or both . . .
	Under the windows opposite them
	there’s a long table, loaded
	
	with potted plants, the foliage
	staining and shadowing the daylight
	as it comes in.
	
	
	II. _The New House_
	
	At the foot of his long shadow
	he walked across the town
	early in the morning
	
	to watch the carpenters at work
	on a new house. Their saws released
	the warm pine-smell into the air
	
	--the scent of time to come, freshly
	opened. He was comforted by that,
	and by the new unblemished wood
	
	That times goes, making
	the jointures of households, for better
	or worse, is no comfort.
	
	That, for the men and women
	still to be born, time is coming
	is a comfort of sorts.
	
	That there’s a little of the good
	left over from a few lives
	is a comfort of sorts.
	
	He has grown eager
	in his love for the good dead
	and all the unborn.
	
	That failed hope
	doesn’t prove the failure of hope
	is a comfort of sorts.
	
	Grown old and wise, he takes
	what comfort he can get, as gladly as once
	he’d have taken the comfort he wished for.
	
	For a man knowing evil--how surely
	it grows up in any ground and makes seed--
	the building of a house is a craft indeed.
	
	
	III. _The Heaviness of His Wisdom_
	
	The incredible happens, he knows.
	The worst possibilities are real.
	The terrible justifies
	
	his dread of it. He knows winter
	despondences, the mind inundated
	by its excrement, hope gone
	
	and not remembered.
	And he knows vernal transfigurations,
	the sentence in the stems of trees
	
	noisy with old memory made new,
	troubled with the seed
	of the being of what has not been.
	
	He trusts the changes of the sun and air:
	dung and carrion made dirt,
	richness that forgets what it was.
	
	He knows, if he can hold out
	long enough, the good
	is given its chance.
	
	he has dreamed of a town
	fit for the abiding of souls
	and bodies that might live forever.
	
	He has seen it as in a far off
	white and gold evening
	of summer, the black flight
	
	of swifts turning above it
	in the air. There’s a clarity
	in which he hasn’t become clear,
	
	his body dragging a shadow,
	half hidden in it.
	
	
	IV. _The Freedom of Loving_
	
	After his long wakeful life,
	he has come to love the world
	as though it’s not to be lost.
	
	Though he faces darkness, his hands
	have no weight or harshness
	on his small granddaughters’ heads.
	
	His love doesn’t ask that they understand
	it includes them. It includes, as freely,
	the green plant leaves in the window,
	
	clusters of white ripe peaches weighting
	the branch among the weightless leaves.
	There was an agony in ripening.
	
	which becomes irrelevant at last
	to ripeness. His love
	turned away from death, freely,
	
	is equal to it.
	
	
	V. _The Fern_
	
	His intimate the green fern
	lives in his eye, its profusion
	veiling the earthen pot,
	
	the leaves lighted and shadowed
	among the actions of the morning.
	Between the fern and the old man
	
	there has been conversation
	all their lives. The leaves
	have spoken to his eyes.
	
	He has replied with his hands.
	In his handing it has come down
	until now--a living
	
	which has survived
	all successions and sheddings.
	Even when he was a boy
	
	plants were his talent. His mother
	would give him the weak ones
	until he made them grow,
	
	then buy them, healed, for dimes.
	And from her he inherits
	the fern, the life of it
	
	on which the new leaves crest.
	It feeds on the sun and the dirt
	and does not hasten.
	
	It has forgotten all deaths.
	
	
	VI. _He’s in the Habit of the World_
	
	The world has finally worn him
	until he’s no longer strange to it.
	His face has grown comfortable on him.
	
	His hat is shaped to his way
	of putting it on and taking it off,
	the crown bordered
	
	with the dark graph of his sweat.
	He has become a scholar of plants
	and gardens, the student
	
	of his memory, attentive to pipesmoke
	and the movements of shadows. His days
	come to him as if they know him.
	
	He has become one of the familiars
	of the place, like a landmark
	the birds no longer fear.
	
	Among the greens of full summer,
	among shadows like monuments,
	he makes his way down,
	
	loving the earth he will become.
	
	
	VII. _The Young Man, Thinking of the Old_
	
	While we talk we hear across the town
	two hammers galloping on a roof, and the high
	curving squeal of an electric saw.
	
	That’s happening deep in the town’s being.
	It’s as weighted and clumsy with its hope
	as a pregnant woman or a loaded barge.
	
	And the old man sitting beside me knows
	the tools and vision of a builder
	of houses, and the uses of those.
	
	His strong marriage has made
	the accuracy of his dwelling.
	As though always speaking openly
	
	in a clear room, he has made
	the ways of neighborhood
	between his house and the town.
	
	His life has been a monument to the place.
	His garden rows go back through all
	his summers, bearing their fading
	
	script of vine and bloom,
	what he has written on the ground,
	its kind abundance, taken kindly from it.
	
	Now, resting from his walk,
	he’s comforted by the sounds
	of hammering, half listened to,
	
	as his eyes rest in the greenness
	of the fern, with attention
	deeper than consciousness.
	
	The strength of the living town
	forces into the design of a house
	--blindly, he knows,
	
	as the life of a tree is forced
	into a shell holding the seed
	for a use or disaster not known.
	
	He’s comforted, not because he hopes
	for much, but because he knows
	of hope, its losses and uses.
	
	He has gone in the world, visioning
	a house worthy of the child
	newborn in it.


11. MANIFESTO

	“Love the quick profit, the annual raise,
	vacation with pay. Want more
	of everything ready-made. Be afraid
	to know your neighbors and to die.
	
	And you will have a window in your head.
	Not even your future will be a mystery
	any more. Your mind will be punched in a card
	and shut away in a little drawer.
	
	When they want you to buy something
	they will call you. When they want you
	to die for profit they will let you know.
	So, friends, every day do something
	that won’t compute. Love the Lord.
	Love the world. Work for nothing.
	Take all that you have and be poor.
	Love someone who does not deserve it.
	
	Denounce the government and embrace
	the flag. Hope to live in that free
	republic for which it stands.
	Give your approval to all you cannot
	understand. Praise ignorance, for what man
	has not encountered he has not destroyed.
	
	Ask the questions that have no answers.
	Invest in the millenium. Plant sequoias.
	Say that your main crop is the forest
	that you did not plant,
	that you will not live to harvest.
	
	Say that the leaves are harvested
	when they have rotted into the mold.
	Call that profit. Prophesy such returns.
	Put your faith in the two inches of humus
	that will build under the trees
	every thousand years.
	
	Listen to carrion--put your ear
	close, and hear the faint chattering
	of the songs that are to come.
	Expect the end of the world. Laugh.
	Laughter is immeasurable. Be joyful
	though you have considered all the facts.
	So long as women do not go cheap
	for power, please women more than men.
	
	Ask yourself: Will this satisfy
	a woman satisfied to bear a child?
	Will this disturb the sleep
	of a woman near to giving birth?
	
	Go with your love to the fields.
	Lie down in the shade. Rest your head
	in her lap. Swear allegiance
	to what is nighest your thoughts.
	
	As soon as the generals and the politicos
	can predict the motions of your mind,
	lose it. Leave it as a sign
	to mark the false trail, the way
	you didn’t go.
	
	Be like the fox
	who makes more tracks than necessary,
	some in the wrong direction.
	Practice resurrection.” 


12. A MEETING IN A PART

	In a dream I meet 
	my dead friend. He has, 
	I know, gone long and far, 
	and yet he is the same 
	for the dead are changeless. 
	They grow no older. 
	It is I who have changed, 
	grown strange to what I was. 
	Yet I, the changed one, 
	ask: “How you been?“ 
	He grins and looks at me. 
	“I been eating peaches 
	off some mighty fine trees.”


13. NINE VERSES OF THE SAME SONG

	I
	
	the ear finely attuned
	to the extravagant music
	of yellow pears ripening
	in the scrolled light
	of orchards as if the world
	were perfect
	hears the cicada burst its shell
	
	
	II
	
	the quiet man sits
	touching his cheek
	in a room delicately walled
	with the sound of rain
	trumpets on the phonograph
	hold the globed gold light
	belling in the mirror’s corridor
	time out of time
	without duration

	a dance of instant light
	in the mirror’s silent hallway
	
	counter-measure
	to clock tick

	burnished crowing
	heard mute in the sun-tattered
	darkness of gravestones

	in the quick of his wrist
	
	
	III _State Fair_
	
	the perfect green
	and red and yellow gold
	of this prized and pampered fruit
	sheaves of millet
	sheaves of wheat
	arranged in perfect ripeness
	beyond our touch
	to music out the light
	as if all possibilities of seed
	became visible and orderly here
	and ripeness final
	but as the sign cautions
	do not touch
	
	perfection is the myth of effort
	
	from here we endlessly return

	music the unplayed strings contain
	
	   hear these imagining
	   imaged in the mind’s ear
	
	it is more mingled and various music
	heard in the human actual ear
	
	a speech breaking categories
	to confront its objects
	
	here the most distant burble
	of water becomes vocal
	
	the blinding noon lick of the sun
	a voice
	
	rapt cicadas thrumming
	the ear’s meat
	
	beyond this light
	and darkness are the same

	in starlight
	slow as a ship

	the picnic done with

	parading
	to his perfect lust
	
	deep-bodied
	slow
	
	he stood a moment attentive
	to the drumming of his blood
	
	then mounted
	brought the period
	to its close
	
	and descended
	to the immediacy of darkness
	and grass
	unwintered and green
	to his quieted flesh
	as if only the hour
	awaited him
	
	to our ears the evening cicadas
	whirred like violins
	their dry atmospheric sound
	
	
	VII _Two Definitive Movements_
	
	my child stood in the doorway
	watching night approach the house
	asking to be allowed outside
	
	and admission granted to the dark
	she chose the light instead
	
	that
	
	and the word _gone_
	she learned to say
	at the summer’s end
	committed
	
	she has touched knowing’s edge
	and will own it
	closely as her flesh
	
	the morning-glory’s opening
	the white tenuous muscle
	flexing to light
	as though no darkness had ever been
	is not profounder music
	
	
	VIII
	
	and my love has come to me
	to ask my comfort
	for the hurt I give her
	--having no other
	
	time and again
	
	tor that trammel me
	my heart
	
	my hearing suffers
	no more sorrowing music

	the child born dead
	goes free of light
	
	bears all time with him
	rounded to his grave


14. THE PEACE OF WILD THINGS

	When despair for the world grows in me
	and I wake in the night at the least sound
	in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be,
	I go and lie down where the wood drake
	rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.
	I come into the peace of wild things
	who do not tax their lives with forethought
	of grief. I come into the presence of still water.
	And I feel above me the day-blind stars
	waiting with their light. For a time
	I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.


15. THE REAL WORK

	It may be that when we no longer know what to do 
	we have come to our real work, 
	
	and that when we no longer know which way to go 
	we have come to our real journey. 
	
	The mind that is not baffled is not employed. 
	
	The impeded stream is the one that sings.


16. THE RIVER VOYAGERS

	I
	
	Where the light’s bells ring
	Morning on the river,
	Waking the town to its round of spires
	And burials, is only half
	The world; this very light shapes a country
	Green of leaf and river
	In the sleep of the dead voyagers;
	Or their death also
	Is a river where morning returns
	And is welcome.
	The scarlet bird chanting
	Its renewal in a tree of shade
	As constantly sings
	To their earthen unhearing ears.
	
	
	II
	
	The ghosts of the voyagers are gay
	In the total sleep of their bones.
	From the green noon shade of the river
	Their vision slowly loves the sky,
	Accepting bird flight, dawn and dark;
	Rage for flesh and possession over,
	They are gentle now; their boats, swamped
	With voyages and drowned, release the stream.
	Through the broad country of their sleep,
	Burnished towers and belfries of the sun,
	The river runs to noon forever;
	The clear light rings with bees.


17. SEPTEMBER 2ND

	In the evening there were flocks of nighthawks
	passing southward over the valley. The tall
	sunflowers stood, burning on their stalks
	to cold seed, by the still river. And high
	up the birds rose into sight against the darkening
	clouds. They tossed themselves among the fading
	landscapes of the sky like rags, as in
	abandonment to the summons their blood knew.
	And in my mind, where had stood a garden
	straining to the light, there grew
	an acceptance of decline. Having worked,
	I would sleep, my leaves all dissolved in flight.


18. THE SILENCE

	Though the air is full of singing 
	my head is loud 
	with the labor of words. 
	
	Though the season is rich 
	with fruit, my tongue 
	hungers for the sweet of speech. 
	
	Though the beech is golden 
	I cannot stand beside it 
	mute, but must say 
	
	‘It is golden,‘ while the leaves 
	stir and fall with a sound 
	that is not a name. 
	
	It is in the silence 
	that my hope is, and my aim. 
	A song whose lines 
	
	I cannot make or sing 
	sounds men’s silence 
	like a root. Let me say 
	
	and not mourn: the world 
	lives in the death of speech 
	and sings there.


19. THEY SIT TOGETHER ON THE PORCH

	They sit together on the porch, the dark
	Almost fallen, the house behind them dark.
	Their supper done with, they have washed and dried
	The dishes--only two plates now, two glasses,
	Two knives, two forks, two spoons--small work for two.
	She sits with her hands folded in her lap,
	At rest. He smokes his pipe. They do not speak,
	And when they speak at last it is to say
	What each one knows the other knows. They have
	One mind between them, now, that finally
	For all its knowing will not exactly know
	Which one goes first through the dark doorway, bidding
	Goodnight, and which sits on a while alone.


20. A TIMBERED CHOIR

	Even while I dreamed I prayed that what I saw was only fear and no foretelling, 
	for I saw the last known landscape destroyed for the sake 
	of the objective, the soil bludgeoned, the rock blasted. 
	Those who had wanted to go home would never get there now. 
	
	I visited the offices where for the sake of the objective the planners planned 
	at blank desks set in rows. I visited the loud factories 
	where the machines were made that would drive ever forward 
	toward the objective. I saw the forest reduced to stumps and gullies; I saw 
	the poisoned river, the mountain cast into the valley; 
	I came to the city that nobody recognized because it looked like every other city. 
	I saw the passages worn by the unnumbered 
	footfalls of those whose eyes were fixed upon the objective. 
	
	Their passing had obliterated the graves and the monuments 
	of those who had died in pursuit of the objective 
	and who had long ago forever been forgotten, according 
	to the inevitable rule that those who have forgotten forget 
	that they have forgotten. Men, women, and children now pursued the objective 
	as if nobody ever had pursued it before. 
	
	The races and the sexes now intermingled perfectly in pursuit of the objective. 
	the once-enslaved, the once-oppressed were now free 
	to sell themselves to the highest bidder 
	and to enter the best paying prisons 
	in pursuit of the objective, which was the destruction of all enemies, 
	which was the destruction of all obstacles, which was the destruction of all objects, 
	which was to clear the way to victory, which was to clear the way to promotion, to salvation, to progress, 
	to the completed sale, to the signature 
	on the contract, which was to clear the way 
	to self-realization, to self-creation, from which nobody who ever wanted to go home 
	would ever get there now, for every remembered place 
	had been displaced; the signposts had been bent to the ground and covered over.
	
	Every place had been displaced, every love 
	unloved, every vow unsworn, every word unmeant 
	to make way for the passage of the crowd 
	of the individuated, the autonomous, the self-actuated, the homeless 
	with their many eyes opened toward the objective 
	which they did not yet perceive in the far distance, 
	having never known where they were going, 
	having never known where they came from.


21. TO THINK OF THE LIFE OF A MAN

	In a time that breaks
	in cutting pieces all around,
	when men, voiceless
	against thing-ridden men,
	set themselves on fire, it seems
	too difficult and rare
	to think of the life of a man
	grown whole in the world,
	at peace and in place.
	But having thought of it
	I am beyond the time
	I might have sold my hands
	or sold my voice and mind
	to the arguments of power
	that go blind against
	what they would destroy.
	I leave all that behind.


22. THE VACATION

	Once there was a man who filmed his vacation. 
	He went flying down the river in his boat 
	with his video camera to his eye, making 
	a moving picture of the moving river 
	upon which his sleek boat moved swiftly 
	toward the end of his vacation. He showed 
	his vacation to his camera, which pictured it, 
	preserving it forever: the river, the trees, 
	the sky, the light, the bow of his rushing boat 
	behind which he stood with his camera 
	preserving his vacation even as he was having it 
	so that after he had had it he would still 
	have it. It would be there. With a flick 
	of a switch, there it would be. But he 
	would not be in it. He would never be in it.


23. THE WISH TO BE GENEROUS

	ALL that I serve will die, all my delights, 
	the flesh kindled from my flesh, garden and field, 
	the silent lilies standing in the woods, 
	the woods, the hill, the whole earth, all 
	will burn in man’s evil, or dwindle 
	in its own age. Let the world bring on me 
	the sleep of darkness without stars, so I may know 
	my little light taken from me into the seed 
	of the beginning and the end, so I may bow 
	to mystery, and take my stand on the earth 
	like a tree in a field, passing without haste 
	or regret toward what will be, my life 
	a patient willing descent into the grass.
