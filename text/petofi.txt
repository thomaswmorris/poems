*** Sándor Petőfi (1823 - 1849)


1. AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER

	In the valley the flowers are still blooming,
	The poplars are still green by the windows,
	But do you see Winter is already looming?
	There is snow on the peak where the wind blows.
	My young heart is freshly filled with Summer blossom,
	While Spring is also in full bloom in there,
	But my dark hair is greying into Autumn
	And begins to show the hoarfrost of Winter.
	The flowers wither, time runs so fast . . .
	Come my beloved wife, sit on my side,
	Come and put your head on my chest,
	As you will on my mound in the graveyard.
	If I die too soon one day, oh, tell me,
	Will you cry and spread a shroud on me in tears?
	Will a new lover make you forget me,
	And convince you to abandon my name with ease?
	
	When you throw away the veil of the widow,
	Place it on my wooden cross as a dark banner,
	I’ll emerge from the sepulchral world below,
	Take it down with me and keep it forever,
	To dry up the tears I shed from my sobs
	For you who so easily forgot,
	And to bandage my wounded heart that still throbs
	And loves you even there, no matter what!



2. AUTUMN IS HERE AGAIN

	Autumn is here again,
	So pleasing to the eye,
	I like it so much,
	Although I don’t know why.
	 
	I sit on top of the hill
	And look around from there,
	Listening to the leaves
	Falling everywhere.
	 
	The gentle sun is shining
	Down on earth with a smile,
	Like a caring mother watching
	Her dear sleeping child.
	 
	Indeed, in autumn the earth
	Only sleeps, it goes still;
	One can see it in its eyes,
	Just sleepy, not ill.
	 
	It took off its fancy clothes,
	It quietly undressed
	To dress up again in the morn,
	So spring will be impressed.
	 
	Sleep beautiful nature,
	Sleep until daybreak,
	Have a pleasant dream
	To enjoy when you awake.
	 
	My fingers are quietly plucking
	The strings of my lyre
	And start playing my wistful song,
	As your lullaby.
	 
	Come my love, sit next to me
	Listen silently until my song
	Like the whispering wind
	Glides over the pond.
	 
	When you kiss me and your lips
	Touch me, watch out, be tender,
	Don’t wake up kind nature
	From her dream-filled slumber.



3. FAREWELL TO CELIBACY

	I leave you now, my oldest friend
	Celibacy, I must say farewell.
	You were my comrade for twenty-five years,
	I can’t go without goodbye, I know it well.
	
	Don’t be mad at me, who, even though your
	Follower, will leave you suddenly,
	I shared my adolescence with you,
	I want my manhood only for me.
	
	I loved you, perhaps like nobody else,
	When you warned me, I obeyed.
	I went wherever the banner of
	Romantic adventures you swayed.
	
	You took me far away to many places;
	I got tired, now I need a rest.
	My bed will be my lover’s two arms
	And my white pillow will be her two soft breasts. 
	
	My young pals are smiling,
	A sneer going from lip to lip
	And they pass me by showing pity . . .
	Sour grapes, I say, isn’t it?
	
	Indeed I am very deplorable,
	Really worthy of all the compassion,
	Because I cannot roam night after night
	Filthier than filthy taverns, with passion.
	
	I am not allowed to love more than one,
	The one who also loves only me.
	Not like their fantastic lovers
	Who loved many hundreds easily.
	
	Farewell my friend, Celibacy!
	You can be angry or you can laugh,
	I am now turning my back on you
	The pleasures you gave me were more than enough.
	
	Get new followers with your colorful banner
	Somewhere else,--me, you can forget.
	All I need now is a white banner
	And that will be my young wife’s bonnet.



4. HOW MANY DROPS HAS THE OCEAN SEA?

	How many drops has the ocean sea? 
	Can you count the stars? 
	In human heads how many hairs can there be? 
	And sins within human hearts? 



5. I DREAMED SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL

	I dreamed something beautiful,
	I dreamed and woke up suddenly.
	Why did you wake me up so soon?
	Why did you have to bother me?
	Happiness in my life is not real,
	At least in my dream it does appear.
	Why did you have to disturb?
	Oh my dear God, oh my dear God,
	Why am I not allowed
	To dream of pleasure in this world?
	You told me that you don’t love me
	But I could not believe it.
	Don’t tell me again, don’t tell me.
	Without saying I know you mean it.
	And when I am aware that my face
	In your heart has no more place:
	Stay or leave? You want me close,
	Perhaps only to please your eyes
	Watching how I agonize
	From the torment that you cause.
	Oh, girl, you are so cruel,
	Just let me get away.
	We have to part forever
	And go on our own way.
	I would fly from you like dust
	When there is wind, fly it must
	To places man can never see
	But I cannot move this boulder,
	My sadness, that is on my shoulder
	And weighs on me so heavily.
	Poor me, I say goodbye to you,
	Awful words I have to say.
	Why don’t they die on my lips
	As they come out, right away?
	I cannot just yet say goodbye,
	Let me hold your hand for a while,
	Your hand that destroyed my happiness
	And tore my future apart,
	Forever breaking my heart,
	To cover it with tears and kisses.
	My tears or my kisses, which is
	Burning your hand more intensely?
	Both tears and kisses can become hot
	And burn your hand immensely,
	Because they both came to life
	Together with my fervent love
	In my burning heart, to ascend
	From this glowing, hot volcano,
	Like pious pilgrims who well know
	That they will die on your hand.
	There is only one thing I ask,
	Don’t fear, it is not that you love me,
	Only a little solace that
	You will keep me in your memory.
	How long will I stay in there?
	How long will you remember?
	If only until you can find
	Someone whose heart throbs for you
	And loves you as much as I do,
	Then I’ll stay forever in your mind!
	But I do not wish that you
	Should not find somebody true
	Like me. If I would have that wish,
	I would not really love you.
	I want you to live happily,
	Pick some leaves from any tree,
	Pick those with a fresh fragrance,
	Weave together young green leaves,
	Then, when old, toss out the dry wreath
	That once was my remembrance.



6. I LOVE YOU MY DARLING

	I love you my darling,
	I love your slim body,
	Your ivory forehead,
	Your hair like ebony,
	Your sparkling dark eyes
	And your rosy cheeks,
	Your tender, soft hands
	And your sweet, full lips.
	I love your soul
	That can fly so high
	And the mountain-lake depth
	Of your warm heart.
	I love you when you’re smiling
	Because you are glad,
	Or with tears in your eyes 
	Because you are sad.
	I love your virtues
	Shining so bright
	And also your faults
	That are never in sight.
	I love you my darling,
	I love you truly
	As much as one can love,
	Deeply, strongly, fully.
	You are everything,
	There’s no life without you,
	You enmesh all my thoughts
	Steadfast, through and through.
	You are all my feelings
	Awake or asleep,
	You are always present
	In my every heart beat.
	I would relinquish 
	All the glory for you
	And, if you wanted,
	Regain it all anew.
	I have no wish
	And no will either
	Because what you want
	Is also my desire.
	No sacrifice is too small
	Of any measure
	If it would give you 
	Even a small pleasure.
	If you would lose something
	Small but it would cause pain
	It would hurt me as well,
	I would feel the same.
	I love you my darling,
	I love you even more,
	I love you like no one
	Has loved you before.
	I love you my darling
	So that it could kill me.
	I am all in one
	Who can love you dearly:
	Husband. son and father
	Or your older brother,
	I am all those and, 
	Most of all, your lover.
	At the same time
	You are also my life,
	Mother, daughter, sister,
	Lover and my wife!
	I love you with my heart,
	I love you with my soul,
	I love you with dreamy,
	Crazy love and more! . . .
	And if one deserves
	A praise or a prize
	For all what I said,
	Those of any size,
	The praise and the prize
	Whatever may be,
	You deserve it all,
	You alone--not me.
	You deserve it all
	Because the love I feel
	
	I learned from you.
	
	You made it all real!



7. I TURNED INTO THE KITCHEN

	I turned into the kitchen with my pipe,
	Because I wanted to put it on light . . . 
	That is, I would have liked to do it,
	If my pipe would not have been lit!
	But my pipe was nicely burning,
	That’s not why I planned to turn in,
	I went ’cause something I noticed
	By no means I wanted to miss!
	What I saw was a pretty girl
	Bustling about in a flickering skirt,
	She made fire in the oven,
	Her eyes had more fire in them!
	We looked into each other’ eyes,
	Until I became mesmerized,
	All the fire in my pipe has died
	And started a flame in my heart.



8. IF YOU ARE A MAN, BE A MAN

	If you are a man, be a man
	Not a puppet, worthless, weak
	That destiny can toss around
	For the pleasure it may seek.
	Fate is a coward bitch that yelps,
	Runs away from the brave
	Who is willing to face it,
	So don’t capitulate!
	If you are a man, be a man,
	Mere words alone are useless.
	Action speaks far better
	Than any Demosthenes.
	Build or destroy like a storm
	And be silent when you are done,
	Like the storm when it is finished
	Quietly dies down.
	If you are a man, be a man,
	Have principles and faith,
	Adhere to them steadfast
	For whatever it takes.
	Rather give up your life
	A hundred times more
	Than deny yourself
	And lose your honor.
	If you are a man, be a man,
	Guard your independence,
	Don’t ever sell it for
	All the world’s abundance.
	Despise those who for a fat meal
	Are willing to sell themselves.
	Your slogan should always be:
	“Beggar-staff and independence!”
	If you are a man, be a man,
	Be strong, be brave, be firm,
	This way you can be certain
	Neither man nor fate can do you harm.
	Be an oak that, by a storm,
	Might sometimes be felled
	But its awesome solid trunk
	The wind could never bend.



9. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FORBID A FLOWER

	It is not possible to forbid a flower
	To bloom in Spring when it has the power.
	Love is the flower, the girl is the Spring,
	It blooms in Spring, it is a given thing.
	Babe, since I first saw you I couldn’t love you more,
	I became the lover of your beautiful soul.
	Your beautiful soul that tenderly smiles
	In the mirror of your enchanting eyes.
	There is a secret question in my heart:
	Do you love me or someone else, sweetheart?
	These thoughts chase each other in my brain,
	Like clouds chase the sunbeam in the Autumn rain.
	Oh, if I knew that your lovely rosy cheeks
	Bathing in milk, wait for someone else’s kiss,
	In this big world I would become an exile,
	Or rather desperately choose to die.
	Star of my happiness, shed on me some light
	So that my life should not be a sad night,
	Love me, pearl of my heart, I don’t ask for more,
	And I ask god to give his blessings to your soul. 



10. JOY

	Sorrow? A great ocean. 
	Joy? A little pearl in the ocean.
	Perhaps, by the time I fish it up, 
	I may break it. 



11. MAN

	Nothing in the world is more ridiculous
	Than man, because he is so presumptuous.
	Just as if he wanted to plow the sky
	With his nose, he always keeps it so high.
	You think that it is the world that is faulty?
	Haughty man, after all what makes you so haughty? 
	
	What do you think is shorter than a blink?
	Your life, my friend, is not even a wink.
	It comes and runs away in an instant,
	It keeps the pillow of your cradle in one hand
	While the cover of your coffin its other hand is holding.
	Haughty man, after all what makes you so haughty?
	
	What can you accomplish in a fleeting glance?
	Conquer nations and people perchance?
	You know what those are who can be conquered?
	Nothing but pitifully weak and coward.
	Ruling them brings only shame, not glory.
	Haughty man, after all what makes you so haughty?
	
	And what is the big name and glory you found?
	It dies with you as you descend into the ground,
	Or, as a guard dog it goes to your grave
	And for a few centuries it will keep it safe.
	But from famine and thirst it will perish slowly.
	Haughty man, after all what makes you so haughty?
	
	Your glory, your name how long will stay?
	The country where you belong will also decay,
	The place where your people have lived since who knows when
	Was once a sea and may become the same again.
	The whole world may end up as a vast void only.
	Haughty man, after all what makes you so haughty?



12. THE MOONLIGHT IS BATHING IN THE SEA OF THE SKY

	The moonlight is bathing in the sea of the sky 
	The brigand is musing in the forest, with a sigh, 
	The night spread thick dew all over the grass, 
	But there are more tears in the bandit’s eyes.
	
	Leaning on the shaft of his axe he’d ponder: 
	“Why did I do all those mean things, I wonder. 
	My dear mother, you always wanted me good, 
	Why did I not listen to you when I could?
	
	I became a vagabond and left my home
	I have joined robbers with whom I roam.
	I am still among them, I am still the same, 
	A menace to travelers, to my utter shame.
	
	I would go home gladly and leave them behind
	But it is too late, there is no home to find.
	My dear mother has died and the house collapsed; 
	The gallows are standing--I am the next!”



13. A PLAN GONE UP IN SMOKE

	All the way home there was one thing 
	I was pondering:
	The first thing to tell my mother 
	Upon my homecoming.
	
	What shall I say to her that is
	Nice, warm and has grace?
	While the arms that rocked my cradle 
	She lifts for embrace.
	
	Endless row of delicious thoughts 
	Pile up in my head,
	Time is at a standstill
	While the carriage speeds ahead.
	
	I step into the small room,
	My mother flies to me . . .
	And I cling to her lips . . . speechless . . . 
	Like fruits on a tree.



14. PROPHECY

	“You told me, mother, that our dreams
	Are drawn by a sacred hand at night,
	The dream is a window to the future
	Where the eyes of our soul get a sight.
	 
	Mother, I was dreaming something,
	Would you explain to me what it meant?
	I had wings and I was flying
	All over, without an end.”
	 
	‘My dear son, sunshine of my soul,
	Happier I could not have been,
	God almighty will give you long life, 
	This is the joyful secret of your dream!’--
	 
	And the child grew, his young age 
	Kept a flame lit in his chest,
	While the song, a soothing relief,
	Gave his heaving heart a rest.
	 
	The youngster grabbed a lute
	And put his sentiments in a song
	And on its wings, his glowing feelings,
	Like birds, were flying all around.
	 
	The magic song flew to the sky,
	Brought the star of fame down
	And from its beams, around his head,
	It weaved a shining crown.
	 
	But the fruit of the song is poison
	And each flower the poet takes away
	From his heart into his lute
	Cuts his life one precious day.
	 
	His feelings caught fire that turned into hell
	And he became the prey of flames,
	Hanging to a branch of the tree of life
	On earth that’s how he remains.
	 
	He lies on his death-bed,
	Child of much torment
	And hears the faltering voice
	Of his heart-broken parent:
	 
	‘Death, don’t take him from my arms;
	Don’t let my dear boy die,
	Heaven promised him a long life . . .
	Or our dreams only lie? . . .’
	 
	“My dear mother, dreams are not lying,
	Although a winding-sheet is my cover,
	The glorious name of your poet son
	Will survive forever and ever!”



15. TIME

	The farmer puts his field under the plow, 
	Then he harrows it even. 
	Time puts our features under the plow, 
	But won’t harrow them even. 



16. WINTER WORLD

	Somebody killed himself tonight
	That is why the stormy wind blows
	And the plate is dancing madly
	Above the barber shop windows.
	Where is happiness nowadays?
	In a cozy, warm, friendly place.
	The day-labourer and his wife
	Work on logs, chopping and sawing,
	Their child wrapped in a fleecy swaddle clothe
	Has a shrilling game with the wind.
	Where is happiness nowadays?
	In a cozy, warm, friendly place.
	The soldier on his beat of sentry
	Takes long strides up and down
	While counting every one of his steps:
	It does not seem to be much fun.
	Where is happiness nowadays?
	In a cozy, warm, friendly place.
	The long-legged wandering tinker,
	His shabby cape he can hardly hold,
	His nose is like a ripe red pepper,
	His eyes full of tears from the cold.
	Where is happiness nowadays?
	In a cozy, warm, friendly place.
	The itinerant actor is strolling
	From one village to another;
	He has no warm garment at all,
	Nevertheless he is starving, no bother.
	Where is happiness nowadays?
	In a cozy, warm, friendly place.
	And the gypsy? . . . his teeth chatter
	Under the ragged tent,
	The wind knocks, then bursts in
	Without the gypsy’s intent.
	Where is happiness nowadays?
	In a cozy, warm, friendly place.
	Somebody killed himself tonight,
	That is why the stormy wind blows
	And the plate is dancing madly
	Above the barber shop windows.
	Where is happiness nowadays?
	In a cozy, warm, friendly place.
