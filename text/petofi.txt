*** Sándor Petőfi (1823 - 1849)


1. AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER

	In the valley the flowers are still blooming,
	The poplars are still green by the windows,
	But do you see Winter is already looming?
	There is snow on the peak where the wind blows.
	My young heart is freshly filled with Summer blossom,
	While Spring is also in full bloom in there,
	But my dark hair is greying into Autumn
	And begins to show the hoarfrost of Winter.
	The flowers wither, time runs so fast . . .
	Come my beloved wife, sit on my side,
	Come and put your head on my chest,
	As you will on my mound in the graveyard.
	If I die too soon one day, oh, tell me,
	Will you cry and spread a shroud on me in tears?
	Will a new lover make you forget me,
	And convince you to abandon my name with ease?
	
	When you throw away the veil of the widow,
	Place it on my wooden cross as a dark banner,
	I’ll emerge from the sepulchral world below,
	Take it down with me and keep it forever,
	To dry up the tears I shed from my sobs
	For you who so easily forgot,
	And to bandage my wounded heart that still throbs
	And loves you even there, no matter what!


2. FAREWELL TO CELIBACY

	I leave you now, my oldest friend
	Celibacy, I must say farewell.
	You were my comrade for twenty-five years,
	I can’t go without goodbye, I know it well.
	
	Don’t be mad at me, who, even though your
	Follower, will leave you suddenly,
	I shared my adolescence with you,
	I want my manhood only for me.
	
	I loved you, perhaps like nobody else,
	When you warned me, I obeyed.
	I went wherever the banner of
	Romantic adventures you swayed.
	
	You took me far away to many places;
	I got tired, now I need a rest.
	My bed will be my lover’s two arms
	And my white pillow will be her two soft breasts. 
	
	My young pals are smiling,
	A sneer going from lip to lip
	And they pass me by showing pity . . .
	Sour grapes, I say, isn’t it?
	
	Indeed I am very deplorable,
	Really worthy of all the compassion,
	Because I cannot roam night after night
	Filthier than filthy taverns, with passion.
	
	I am not allowed to love more than one,
	The one who also loves only me.
	Not like their fantastic lovers
	Who loved many hundreds easily.
	
	Farewell my friend, Celibacy!
	You can be angry or you can laugh,
	I am now turning my back on you
	The pleasures you gave me were more than enough.
	
	Get new followers with your colorful banner
	Somewhere else,--me, you can forget.
	All I need now is a white banner
	And that will be my young wife’s bonnet.


3. I DREAMED SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL

	I dreamed something beautiful,
	I dreamed and woke up suddenly.
	Why did you wake me up so soon?
	Why did you have to bother me?
	Happiness in my life is not real,
	At least in my dream it does appear.
	Why did you have to disturb?
	Oh my dear God, oh my dear God,
	Why am I not allowed
	To dream of pleasure in this world?
	You told me that you don’t love me
	But I could not believe it.
	Don’t tell me again, don’t tell me.
	Without saying I know you mean it.
	And when I am aware that my face
	In your heart has no more place:
	Stay or leave? You want me close,
	Perhaps only to please your eyes
	Watching how I agonize
	From the torment that you cause.
	Oh, girl, you are so cruel,
	Just let me get away.
	We have to part forever
	And go on our own way.
	I would fly from you like dust
	When there is wind, fly it must
	To places man can never see
	But I cannot move this boulder,
	My sadness, that is on my shoulder
	And weighs on me so heavily.
	Poor me, I say goodbye to you,
	Awful words I have to say.
	Why don’t they die on my lips
	As they come out, right away?
	I cannot just yet say goodbye,
	Let me hold your hand for a while,
	Your hand that destroyed my happiness
	And tore my future apart,
	Forever breaking my heart,
	To cover it with tears and kisses.
	My tears or my kisses, which is
	Burning your hand more intensely?
	Both tears and kisses can become hot
	And burn your hand immensely,
	Because they both came to life
	Together with my fervent love
	In my burning heart, to ascend
	From this glowing, hot volcano,
	Like pious pilgrims who well know
	That they will die on your hand.
	There is only one thing I ask,
	Don’t fear, it is not that you love me,
	Only a little solace that
	You will keep me in your memory.
	How long will I stay in there?
	How long will you remember?
	If only until you can find
	Someone whose heart throbs for you
	And loves you as much as I do,
	Then I’ll stay forever in your mind!
	But I do not wish that you
	Should not find somebody true
	Like me. If I would have that wish,
	I would not really love you.
	I want you to live happily,
	Pick some leaves from any tree,
	Pick those with a fresh fragrance,
	Weave together young green leaves,
	Then, when old, toss out the dry wreath
	That once was my remembrance.


4. I LOVE YOU MY DARLING

	I love you my darling,
	I love your slim body,
	Your ivory forehead,
	Your hair like ebony,
	Your sparkling dark eyes
	And your rosy cheeks,
	Your tender, soft hands
	And your sweet, full lips.
	I love your soul
	That can fly so high
	And the mountain-lake depth
	Of your warm heart.
	I love you when you’re smiling
	Because you are glad,
	Or with tears in your eyes 
	Because you are sad.
	I love your virtues
	Shining so bright
	And also your faults
	That are never in sight.
	I love you my darling,
	I love you truly
	As much as one can love,
	Deeply, strongly, fully.
	You are everything,
	There’s no life without you,
	You enmesh all my thoughts
	Steadfast, through and through.
	You are all my feelings
	Awake or asleep,
	You are always present
	In my every heart beat.
	I would relinquish 
	All the glory for you
	And, if you wanted,
	Regain it all anew.
	I have no wish
	And no will either
	Because what you want
	Is also my desire.
	No sacrifice is too small
	Of any measure
	If it would give you 
	Even a small pleasure.
	If you would lose something
	Small but it would cause pain
	It would hurt me as well,
	I would feel the same.
	I love you my darling,
	I love you even more,
	I love you like no one
	Has loved you before.
	I love you my darling
	So that it could kill me.
	I am all in one
	Who can love you dearly:
	Husband. son and father
	Or your older brother,
	I am all those and, 
	Most of all, your lover.
	At the same time
	You are also my life,
	Mother, daughter, sister,
	Lover and my wife!
	I love you with my heart,
	I love you with my soul,
	I love you with dreamy,
	Crazy love and more! . . .
	And if one deserves
	A praise or a prize
	For all what I said,
	Those of any size,
	The praise and the prize
	Whatever may be,
	You deserve it all,
	You alone--not me.
	You deserve it all
	Because the love I feel
	
	I learned from you.
	
	You made it all real!


5. MAN

	Nothing in the world is more ridiculous
	Than man, because he is so presumptuous.
	Just as if he wanted to plow the sky
	With his nose, he always keeps it so high.
	You think that it is the world that is faulty?
	Haughty man, after all what makes you so haughty? 
	
	What do you think is shorter than a blink?
	Your life, my friend, is not even a wink.
	It comes and runs away in an instant,
	It keeps the pillow of your cradle in one hand
	While the cover of your coffin its other hand is holding.
	Haughty man, after all what makes you so haughty?
	
	What can you accomplish in a fleeting glance?
	Conquer nations and people perchance?
	You know what those are who can be conquered?
	Nothing but pitifully weak and coward.
	Ruling them brings only shame, not glory.
	Haughty man, after all what makes you so haughty?
	
	And what is the big name and glory you found?
	It dies with you as you descend into the ground,
	Or, as a guard dog it goes to your grave
	And for a few centuries it will keep it safe.
	But from famine and thirst it will perish slowly.
	Haughty man, after all what makes you so haughty?
	
	Your glory, your name how long will stay?
	The country where you belong will also decay,
	The place where your people have lived since who knows when
	Was once a sea and may become the same again.
	The whole world may end up as a vast void only.
	Haughty man, after all what makes you so haughty?
