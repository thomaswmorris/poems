*** Daniel Berrigan (1921 - 2016)


1. CONSOLATION

	Listen
	if now and then
	you hear the dead
	muttering like ashes
	creaking like empty
	rockers on porches
	
	filling you in filling you in
	
	like winds in empty
	branches like a star
	in wintry trees
	so far
	so good
	
	you’ve mastered finally
	one foreign tongue


2. CREDENTIALS

	I would it were possible to state in so
	few words my errand in the world: quite simply
	forestalling all inquiry, the oak offers his leaves
	largehandedly. And in winter his integral magnificent order
	decrees, says solemnly who he is
	in the great thrusting limbs that are all finally
	one: a return, a permanent riverandsea.
	
	So the rose is its own credential, a certain
	unattainable effortless form: wearing its heart
	visibly, it gives us heart too: bud, fullness and fall.


3. PRAYER ON THE 6 P.M. SUBWAY

	unsteady
	my prayer mounts or falls     why do I
	waste so     want so
	O make room
	in the kingdom of light for lack lusters
	among the austere and severe
	for malfunctioning men
	only this to their credit     NO GREAT HARM DONE
	only passage writes
	MAYBE on water
	
	nevertheless
	might make it yet
	who knows     who knows
	whether some hour
	turns us on
	unbelievable
	as Christ’s new somersaulting
	start     his words     his heart
