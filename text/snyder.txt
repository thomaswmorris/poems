*** Gary Snyder (1930 - )


1. AFTER WORK

	The shack and a few trees
	float in the blowing fog
	
	I pull out your blouse,
	warm my cold hands
	on your breasts.
	you laugh and shudder
	peeling garlic by the
	hot iron stove.
	bring in the axe, the rake,
	the wood
	
	we’ll lean on the wall
	against each other
	stew simmering on the fire
	as it grows dark
	drinking wine.


2. DECEMBER AT YASE

	You said, that October,
	In the tall dry grass by the orchard
	When you chose to be free,
	“Again someday, maybe ten years.”
	
	After college I saw you
	One time. You were strange,
	And I was obsessed with a plan.
	
	Now ten years and more have
	Gone by: I’ve always known
	where you were--
	I might have gone to you
	Hoping to win your love back.
	You still are single.
	
	I didn’t.
	I thought I must make it alone. I
	Have done that.
	
	Only in dream, like this dawn,
	Does the grave, awed intensity
	Of our young love
	Return to my mind, to my flesh.
	
	We had what the others
	All crave and seek for;
	We left it behind at nineteen.
	
	I feel ancient, as though I had
	Lived many lives.
	
	And may never now know
	If I am a fool
	Or have done what my
	karma demands.


3. SPRING

	Beating asphalt into highway potholes
	pickup truck we’d loaded
	road repair stock shed & yard
	a day so hot the asphalt went in soft.
	pipe and steel plate tamper
	took turns at by hand
	then drive the truck rear wheel
	a few times back and forth across the fill--
	finish it off with bitchmo around the edge.
	
	the foreman said let’s get a drink
	& drove through the woods and flower fields
	shovels clattering in back
	into a black grove by a cliff
	a rocked in pool
	feeding a fern ravine
	tin can to drink
	numbing the hand and cramping in the gut
	surging through the fingers from below
	& dark here--
	let’s get back to the truck
	get back on the job.


4. THERE ARE THOSE WHO LOVE TO GET DIRTY

	There are those who love to get dirty
	and fix things.
	They drink coffee at dawn,
	beer after work,
	
	And those who stay clean,
	just appreciate things,
	At breakfast they have milk
	and juice at night.
	
	There are those who do both,
	they drink tea.
