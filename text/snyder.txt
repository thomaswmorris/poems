*** Gary Snyder (1930 - )


1. ABOVE PATE VALLEY

	We finished clearing the last
	Section of trail by noon,
	High on the ridge-side
	Two thousand feet above the creek
	Reached the pass, went on
	Beyond the white pine groves,
	Granite shoulders, to a small
	Green meadow watered by the snow,
	Edged with Aspen--sun
	Straight high and blazing
	But the air was cool.
	Ate a cold fried trout in the
	Trembling shadows. I spied
	A glitter, and found a flake
	Black volcanic glass--obsidian--
	By a flower. Hands and knees
	Pushing the Bear grass, thousands
	Of arrowhead leavings over a
	Hundred yards. Not one good
	Head, just razor flakes
	On a hill snowed all but summer,
	A land of fat summer deer,
	They came to camp. On their
	Own trails. I followed my own
	Trail here. Picked up the cold-drill,
	Pick, singlejack, and sack
	Of dynamite.
	Ten thousand years.


2. AFTER WORK

	The shack and a few trees
	float in the blowing fog
	
	I pull out your blouse,
	warm my cold hands
	on your breasts.
	you laugh and shudder
	peeling garlic by the
	hot iron stove.
	bring in the axe, the rake,
	the wood
	
	we’ll lean on the wall
	against each other
	stew simmering on the fire
	as it grows dark
	drinking wine.


3. DECEMBER AT YASE

	You said, that October,
	In the tall dry grass by the orchard
	When you chose to be free,
	“Again someday, maybe ten years.”
	
	After college I saw you
	One time. You were strange,
	And I was obsessed with a plan.
	
	Now ten years and more have
	Gone by: I’ve always known
	where you were--
	I might have gone to you
	Hoping to win your love back.
	You still are single.
	
	I didn’t.
	I thought I must make it alone. I
	Have done that.
	
	Only in dream, like this dawn,
	Does the grave, awed intensity
	Of our young love
	Return to my mind, to my flesh.
	
	We had what the others
	All crave and seek for;
	We left it behind at nineteen.
	
	I feel ancient, as though I had
	Lived many lives.
	
	And may never now know
	If I am a fool
	Or have done what my
	karma demands.


4. I WENT INTO THE MAVERICK BAR

	I went into the Maverick Bar   
	In Farmington, New Mexico.
	And drank double shots of bourbon
	                         backed with beer.
	My long hair was tucked up under a cap
	I’d left the earring in the car.
	
	Two cowboys did horseplay
	                         by the pool tables,
	A waitress asked us
	                         where are you from?
	a country-and-western band began to play   
	“We don’t smoke Marijuana in Muskokie”   
	And with the next song,
	                         a couple began to dance.
	
	They held each other like in High School dances   
	                         in the fifties;
	I recalled when I worked in the woods
	                         and the bars of Madras, Oregon.   
	That short-haired joy and roughness--
	                         America--your stupidity.   
	I could almost love you again.
	
	We left--onto the freeway shoulders--
	                         under the tough old stars--
	In the shadow of bluffs
	                         I came back to myself,
	To the real work, to
	                         “What is to be done.”


5. SPRING

	Beating asphalt into highway potholes
	pickup truck we’d loaded
	road repair stock shed & yard
	a day so hot the asphalt went in soft.
	pipe and steel plate tamper
	took turns at by hand
	then drive the truck rear wheel
	a few times back and forth across the fill--
	finish it off with bitchmo around the edge.
	
	the foreman said let’s get a drink
	& drove through the woods and flower fields
	shovels clattering in back
	into a black grove by a cliff
	a rocked in pool
	feeding a fern ravine
	tin can to drink
	numbing the hand and cramping in the gut
	surging through the fingers from below
	& dark here--
	let’s get back to the truck
	get back on the job.


6. THERE ARE THOSE WHO LOVE TO GET DIRTY

	There are those who love to get dirty
	and fix things.
	They drink coffee at dawn,
	beer after work,
	
	And those who stay clean,
	just appreciate things,
	At breakfast they have milk
	and juice at night.
	
	There are those who do both,
	they drink tea.
