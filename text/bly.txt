*** Robert Bly (1926 - 2021)


1. AFTER WORKING

	I
	
	After many strange thoughts,
	Thoughts of distant harbors, and new life,
	I came in and found the moonlight lying in the room.
	
	
	II
	
	Outside it covers the trees like pure sound,
	The sound of tower bells, or of water moving under the ice,
	The sound the deaf hear through the bones of their heads.
	
	
	III
	
	We know the road; as the moonlight
	Lifts everything, so in a night like this,
	The road goes on ahead, it is all clear.


2. THE BEAUTY OF WOMEN

	Delicate women, with eyes open,
	Arms hung lightly as they ride,
	Naked feet covered with jewels,
	Some small scarf trailing from their wrists,
	Shoulders of the spirit:
	This is the secret of Nonnus and Pelagia,
	A chorus of old men shouting Amen.


3. A BOY ON THE FARM

	I was one of the saved.
	The chickens were, too
	Morning came; only
	The hired girl was ready.
	
	The rest of us dozed,
	And got up, and fed chickens.
	The guinea hens rose
	From unimaginable places.
	
	We couldn’t understand
	How strange they were.
	They slept in trees
	And had better nights.


4. CLEAR AIR OF OCTOBER

	I can see outdoors the gold wings without birds
	Flying around, and the wells of cold water
	Without walls standing eighty feet up in the air,
	I can feel the crickets’ singing carrying them into the sky.
	
	I know these shadows are falling for hundreds of miles,
	Crossing lawns in tiny towns, and the doors of Catholic churches;
	I know the horse of darkness is riding fast to the east,
	Carrying a thin man with no coat.
	
	And I know the sun is sinking down great stairs,
	Like an executioner with a great blade walking into a cellar,
	And the gold animals, the lions, and the zebras, and the pheasants,
	Are waiting at the head of the stairs with robbers’ eyes.


5. COME WITH ME

	Come with me into those things that have felt this despair for
		so long--
	Those removed Chevrolet wheels that howl with a terrible lone-
		liness,
	Lying on their backs in the cindery dirt, like men drunk and
		naked,
	Staggering off down a hill to drown at last in a pond;
	Shredded inner tubes abandoned on the shoulders of thruways,
	Black and collapsed souls, who tried and burst
	And were left behind,
	And those curled steel shavings scattered about on oily benches,
	Sometimes still warm, gritty when we hold them,
	Who have given up, and blame everything on the government,
	And those roads in South Dakota that feel around in the dark-
		ness . . . 


6. THE CONFUSION OF AMERICA

	I
	
	The lace that lay around the bones of Danish kings
	Rises at dawn in the grass of North Dakota;
	The torture rack is the steering wheel of a Dodge,
	And the Assyrian lions blaze above the soybean fields;
	The last haven of Jehovah, down from the old heavens,
	Hugs a sooty corner of the murdered pine;
	Phoenician priests carrying Arabic numerals
	Walk the earth dressed as bankers and hunters of bear,
	And at night our sleep is invaded by stealthy diamonds.
	
	
	II
	
	The old jewels of Charlemagne fall in the flakes of snow
	And lie drifted in the door of a pig-house,
	Left abandoned all winter in a barnyard in Montana;
	Our bodies are mingled among bills and relics
	Like Bibles and carbines in the Sears Roebuck catalog;
	Saxophones and gears fly together in the nightmares
	Rising, like feathers, from the grave of Hannibal,
	And tiny beetles, bright as Cadillacs, toil down
	The long dusty roads into the mountains of South Dakota.
	
	
	III
	
	We meet men who travelled in Canada for Astor,
	And also strange animals, men with wings of fur,
	Cars that fly through the air with the faces of women,
	Sheep come in hotels wearing crow feathers painted red,
	Rocks climb up stairs balancing on the feet of birds,
	Glasses of water swallow tiny cities with gypsy fairs,
	Poor accountants awake one day with the paws of bears;
	High in the beanplant that has grown from Carnegie’s dime,
	Tiny loaves of bread with ears lie on the President’s table.


7. FALL

	From far out in the center of the naked lake
	A loon’s cry came--
	It was the cry of someone who owned very little.


8. HURRYING AWAY FROM THE EARTH

	The poor, and the dazed, and the idiots
	Are with us, they live in the casket of the sun
	And the moon’s coffin, as I walk out tonight
	Seeing the night wheeling their dark wheelbarrow
	All about the plains of heaven,
	And the stars inexorable rising.
	Dark moon! Sinister tears!
	Shadow of slums and of the conquering dead!
	
	Some men have pierced the chest with a long needle
	To stop their heart from beating any more;
	Another put blocks of ice in his bed
	So he would die, women
	Have washed their hair, and hung themselves
	In the long braids, one climbed
	A high tree above her house
	And lawn and swallowed poisonous spiders--
	
	The time for exhortation is past. I have heard
	The iron chairs scraping in asylums,
	As the cold bird hunches into the winter
	In the windy nights of November.
	The coal miners rise from their pits
	Like a flash flood,
	Like a rice field disintegrating.
	Now men cry when they hear stories of someone
		rising from the dead.


9. IN BOWLING GREEN, KENTUCKY

	The mourning dove’s call woke me
	In the still night, when it was still night
	To me. Those sounds came from a time
	Before the box radio, even, and they said,
	A man is walking alone down the canyon.
	There’s a baby lost. I saw my dead father
	Last night near the cottonwood grove.
	
	The mourning dove’s story, so lonely
	In the morning, is a tale of water. It says:
	Remember that the cool egg is waiting
	Still on the floor of the swift river,
	And my calls will bring it forth.
	Then this world of taxes will disappear
	And you’ll be with your mother again.


10. SNOWFALL IN THE NOVEMBER AFTERNOON

	I
	
	The grass is half-covered with snow.
	It was the kind of snowfall that starts in late afternoon,
	And now the little houses of the grass are growing dark.
	
	
	II
	
	If I reached my hands down, near the earth,
	I could take handfulls of darkness!
	That darkness was always there, which we never noticed.
	
	
	III
	
	As the snow grows heavier, the cornstalks fade farther away,
	And the barn moves nearer to the house.
	The barn moves all alone in the growing storm.
	
	IV
	
	The barn is full of corn, and moving toward us now
	Like a hulk blown toward us in a storm at sea;
	All the sailors on deck have been blind for many years.


11. THINKING OF HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS

	Smoke rising over the full moon,
	Like a cloud forming inside a transparent stone,
	Smouldering fires,
	Leaves raked together still not having met the fire,
	But all the other girls nearby going up in heavy smoke.


12. WANTING SUMPTUOUS HEAVENS

	No one grumbles among the oyster clans, 
	And lobsters play their bone guitars all summer. 
	Only we, with our opposable thumbs, want 
	Heaven to be, and God to come, again. 
	There is no end to our grumbling; we want 
	Comfortable earth and sumptuous Heaven. 
	But the heron standing on one leg in the bog 
	Drinks his dark rum all day, and is content.


13. WHY WE DON’T DIE

	In late September many voices
	Tell you you will die.
	That leaf says it, that coolness.
	All of them are right.
	
	Our many souls--what
	Can they do about it?
	Nothing. They’re already
	Part of the invisible.
	
	Our souls have been
	Longing to go home
	Anyway. “It’s late,” they say,
	“Lock the door, let’s go.”
	
	The body doesn’t agree. It says
	“We buried a little iron
	Ball under that tree.
	Let’s go get it.”
