*** Boris Pasternak (1890 - 1960)


1. AUGUST

	This was its promise, held to faithfully:
	The early morning sun came in this way
	Until the angle of its saffron beam
	Between the curtains and the sofa lay,
	
	And with its ochre heat it spread across
	The village houses, and the nearby wood,
	Upon my bed and on my dampened pillow
	And to the corner where the bookcase stood.
	
	Then I recalled the reason why my pillow
	Had been so dampened by those tears that fell--
	I’d dreamt I saw you coming one by one
	Across the wood to wish me your farewell.
	
	You came in ones and twos, a straggling crowd;
	Then suddenly someone mentioned a word:
	It was the sixth of August, by Old Style,
	And the Transfiguration of Our Lord.
	
	For from Mount Tabor usually this day
	There comes a light without a flame to shine,
	And autumn draws all eyes upon itself
	As clear and unmistaken as a sign.
	
	But you came forward through the tiny, stripped,
	The pauperly and trembling alder grove,
	Into the graveyard’s coppice, russet-red,
	Which, like stamped gingerbread, lay there and glowed.
	
	And with the silence of those high treetops
	Was neighbour only the imposing sky
	And in the echoed crowing of the cocks
	The distances and distances rang by:
	
	There in the churchyard underneath the trees,
	Like some surveyor from the government
	Death gazed on my pale face to estimate
	How large a grave would suit my measurement.
	
	All those who stood there could distinctly hear
	A quiet voice emerge from where I lay:
	The voice was mine, my past; prophetic words
	That sounded now, unsullied by decay:
	
	‘Farewell, wonder of azure and of gold
	Surrounding the Transfiguration’s power:
	Assuage now with a woman’s last caress
	The bitterness of my predestined hour!
	
	‘Farewell timeless expanse of passing years!
	Farewell, woman who flung your challenge steeled
	Against the abyss of humiliations:
	For it is I who am your battlefield!
	
	‘Farewell, you span of open wings outspread,
	The voluntary obstinacy of flight,
	O figure of the world revealed in speech,
	Creative genius, wonder-working might!’


2. AUTUMN

	I have allowed my family to scatter,
	All those who were my dearest to depart,
	And once again an age-long loneliness
	Comes in to fill all nature and my heart.
	
	Alone this cottage shelters me and you:
	The wood is an unpeopled wilderness
	And ways and footpaths wear, as in the song.
	Weeds almost overgrowing each recess;
	
	And where we sit together by ourselves
	The log walls gaze upon us mournfully.
	We gave no promise to leap obstacles,
	We shall yet face our end with honesty.
	
	At one we’ll sit, at three again we’ll rise,
	My book with me, your sewing in your hand,
	Nor with the dawning shall we realize
	When all our kissing shall have had an end.
	
	You leaves, more richly and more recklessly
	Rustle your dresses, spill yourselves away,
	And fill a past day’s cup of bitterness
	Still higher with the anguish of today!
	
	All this delight, devotion and desire!
	We’ll fling ourselves into September’s riot!
	Immure yourself within the autumn’s rustle
	Entirely: go crazy, or be quiet!
	
	How when you fall into my gentle arms
	Enrobed in that silk-tasselled dressing gown
	You shake the dress you wear away from you
	As only coppices shake their leaves down!--
	
	You are the blessing on my baneful way,
	When life has depths worse than disease can reach,
	And courage is the only root of beauty,
	And it is this that draws us each to each.


3. EVE

	By water’s edge, quiet willows stand,
	And from the steep bank, high noon flings
	White fleecy clouds into the pond
	As if they were a fisher’s seines.
	
	The firmament sinks like a net,
	A crowd of sunburnt bathers dive
	With yells into the pond, and head
	For this elusive netlike sky.
	
	Some women from the water rise
	Under the scanty willows’ lee,
	And stepping on the sand, wring dry
	Their bathing costumes hurriedly.
	
	The coils of fabric twist and slide
	Like water-snakes, and nimbly roll,
	As if the dripping garments hide
	Beguiling serpents in their folds.
	
	0 woman, neither looks nor shape
	Will nonplus me or make me gloat.
	You, all of you, are like a lump
	In my excitement-stricken throat.
	
	You look as if hewn in the rough--
	A stray verse line dashed off ad lib.
	You make me think it is the truth--
	That you were made out of my rib.
	
	And instantly you broke away
	From my embrace, and moved apart,
	All fear, confusion, disarray--
	And missing beats of a man’s heart.


4. FROM EARLY DAWN THE THIRTIETH OF APRIL

	From early dawn the thirtieth of April
	Is given up to children of the town,
	And caught in trying on the festive necklace,
	By dusk it only just is settling down.
	
	Like heaps of squashy berries under muslin
	The town emerges out of crimson gauze.
	Along the streets the boulevards are dragging
	Their twilight with them, like a rank of dwarves.
	
	The evening world is always eve and blossom,
	But this one with a sprouting of its own
	From May-day anniversaries will flower
	One day into a commune fully blown.
	
	For long it will remain a day of shifting,
	Pre-festive cleaning, fanciful decor,
	As once it used to be with Whitsun birches
	Or pan-Athenian fires long before.
	
	Just so they will go on, conveying actors
	To their assembly points; beat sand; just so
	Pull up towards illuminated ledges
	The plywood boards, the crimson calico.
	
	Just so in threes the sailors briskly walking
	Will skirt the grass in gardens and in parks,
	The moon at nightfall sink into the pavements
	Like a dead city or a burnt-out hearth.
	
	But with each year more splendid and more spreading
	The taut beginning of the rose will bloom,
	More clearly grow in health and sense of honour,
	Sincerity more visibly will loom.
	
	The living folksongs, customs and traditions
	Will ever spreading, many-petalled lay
	Their scent on fields and industries and meadows
	From early buddings on the first of May,
	
	Until the full fermented risen spirit
	Of ripened years will shoot up, like the smell
	Of humid centifolia. It will have to
	Reveal itself, it cannot help but tell.


5. I HANG LIMP ON THE CREATOR’S PEN

	I hang limp on the Creator’s pen
	Like a large drop of lilac gloss-paint.
	
	Underneath are dykes’ secrets; the air
	From the railways is sodden and sticky,
	Of the fumes of coal and night fires reeking.
	But the moment night kills sunset’s glare,
	It turns pink itself, tinged with far flares,
	And the fence stands stiff, paradox-stricken.
	
	It keeps muttering: stop it till dawn.
	Let the dry whiting finally settle.
	Hard as nails is the worm-eaten ground,
	And the echo’s as keen as a skittle.
	
	Warm spring wind, spots of cheviot and mud,
	Early naileries’ hoots faraway,
	On the grater of cobble-stones road,
	As on radishes lavishly sprayed,
	Tears stand out clearly at break of day.
	
	Like an acrid drop of thick lead paint,
	I hang on to the Creator’s pen.


6. JULY

	A ghost is roaming through the building,
	And shadows in the attic browse;
	Persistently intent on mischief
	A goblin roams about the house.
	
	He gets into your way, he fusses,
	You hear his footsteps overhead,
	He tears the napkin off the table
	And creeps in slippers to the bed.
	
	With feet unwiped he rushes headlong
	On gusts of draught into the hall
	And whirls the curtain, like a dancer,
	Towards the ceiling, up the wall.
	
	Who is this silly mischief-maker,
	This phantom and this double-face?
	He is our guest, our summer lodger,
	Who spends with us his holidays.
	
	Our house is taken in possession
	By him, while he enjoys a rest.
	July, with summer air and thunder--
	He is our temporary guest.
	
	July, who scatters from his pockets
	The fluff of blow-balls in a cloud,
	Who enters through the open window,
	Who chatters to himself aloud,
	
	Unkempt, untidy, absent-minded,
	Soaked through with smell of dill and rye,
	With linden-blossom, grass and beet-leaves,
	The meadow-scented month July.


7. MARCH

	The sun is hotter than the top ledge in a steam bath;
	The ravine, crazed, is rampaging below.
	Spring--that corn-fed, husky milkmaid--
	Is busy at her chores with never a letup.
	
	The snow is wasting (pernicious anemia--
	See those branching veinlets of impotent blue?)
	Yet in the cowbarn life is burbling, steaming,
	And the tines of pitchforks simply glow with health.
	
	These days--these days, and these nights also!
	With eavesdrop thrumming its tattoos at noon,
	With icicles (cachectic!) hanging on to gables,
	And with the chattering of rills that never sleep!
	
	All doors are flung open--in stable and in cowbarn;
	Pigeons peck at oats fallen in the snow;
	And the culprit of all this and its life-begetter--
	The pile of manure--is pungent with ozone.


8. MARY MAGDELENE

	People clean their homes before the feast.
	Stepping from the bustle of the street
	I go down before Thee on my knees
	And anoint with myrrh Thy holy feet.
	
	Groping round, I cannot find the shoes
	For the tears that well up with my sighs.
	My impatient tresses, breaking loose,
	Like a pall hang thick before my eyes.
	
	I take up Thy feet onto my lap,
	Wash them clean with hot tears from my eyes,
	In my hair Thy precious feet I wrap,
	And my string of pearls around them tie.
	
	I now see the future in detail,
	As if it were stopped in flight by Thee.
	Like a raving sibyl, I could tell
	What will happen, how it will all be.
	
	In the temple, veils will fall tomorrow,
	We shall form a frightened group apart,
	And the earth will shake-perhaps from sorrow
	And from pity for my tortured heart.
	
	Troops will then reform and march away
	To the thud of hoofs and heavy tread,
	And the cross will reach towards the sky
	Like a water-spout above our heads.
	
	By the cross, I’ll fall down on the ground,
	I shall bite my lips till I draw blood.
	On the cross, your arms will be spread out--
	Wide enough to hug the whole wide world.
	
	Who’s this for, this glory and this strife?
	Who’s this for, this torment and this might?
	Are there enough souls on earth, and lives?
	Are there enough cities, dales and heights?
	
	But three days-such days and nights will pass--
	They will fill me with such crushing dread
	That I’ll see the joyous truth, at last:
	I shall know Christ will rise from the dead.


9. SPARROW HILLS

	My kisses across your breast, like water from a jug!
	They’ll have an end, and soon, our days of summer heat.
	Nor shall we every night rise up in trailing dust
	The hurdy-gurdy’s bellow, stamp and drag our feet.
	
	I’ve heard about old age. What ominous forebodings!
	That no wave will lift again to the stars its hands,
	That waters will speak no more; no god in the woods;
	No heart within the pools; no life in meadowlands.
	
	O rouse your soul! This frenzied day is yours to have!
	It is the world’s midday. Why don’t you use your eyes?
	Look, there’s thought upon high hills in seething bubbles
	Of heat, woodpeckers, cones and needles, clouds and skies.
	
	Here tracks of city trolleys stop, and further
	The pines alone must satisfy. Trams cannot pass.
	It is always Sunday there! Plucking little branches,
	There the clearing capers, slipping on the grass.
	
	And strewing sunrays, Whitsun, and rambling walks,
	The woods will have us say the world was always so:
	Conceived like that by forests, hinted to the meadows,
	And spilt by clouds as on a chintz design below.


10. SPRING SHOWER

	Winked to the birdcherry, gulped amid tears,
	Splashed over carriages’ varnish, trees’ tremble.
	Full moon. The musicians are picking their way
	To the theatre. More and more people assemble.
	
	Puddles on stone. Like a throat overfilled
	With tears are the roses, deep with wet scalding
	Diamonds. Showers of gladness thrill,
	Eyelashes, stormclouds, and roses enfolding.
	
	The moon for the first time is casting in plaster
	An epic poem uncast till today:
	The cordons, the flutter of dresses, the speaker
	And people enraptured and carried away.
	
	Whose is the heart whose whole blood shot to glory
	Drained from the cheeks? We are held in his grip.
	The hands of Kerensky are squeezing together
	Into a bunch our aortas and lips.
	
	This is not night, not rain, not a chorus
	Of tearing acclaim for him, swelled to a roar--
	This is the blinding leap to the Forum
	From catacombs wanting an exit before.
	
	It is not roses, not Ups, not the roaring
	Crowd-it’s the surf on Theatre Square,
	Marking the end of the long sleep of Europe,
	Proud of her own reawakening here.


11. WET PAINT

	‘Look out! Wet paint.’ My soul was blind,
	I have to pay the price,
	All marked with stains of calves and cheeks
	And hands and lips and eyes.
	
	I loved you more than luck or grief
	Because with you in sight
	The old and yellowed world became
	As white as painters’ white.
	
	I swear my friend, my gloom--it will
	One day still whiter gleam,
	Than lampshades, than a bandaged brow,
	Than a delirious dream.


12. WINTER NIGHT

	It snowed and snowed, the whole world over,
	Snow swept the world from end to end.
	A candle burned on the table;
	A candle burned.
	
	As during summer midges swarm
	To beat their wings against a flame
	Out in the yard the snowflakes swarmed
	To beat against the window pane
	
	The blizzard sculptured on the glass
	Designs of arrows and of whorls.
	A candle burned on the table;
	A candle burned.
	
	Distorted shadows fell
	Upon the lighted ceiling:
	Shadows of crossed arms,of crossed legs--
	Of crossed destiny.
	
	Two tiny shoes fell to the floor
	And thudded.
	A candle on a nightstand shed wax tears
	Upon a dress.
	
	All things vanished within
	The snowy murk-white,hoary.
	A candle burned on the table;
	A candle burned.
	
	A corner draft fluttered the flame
	And the white fever of temptation
	Upswept its angel wings that cast
	A cruciform shadow
	
	It snowed hard throughout the month
	Of February, and almost constantly
	A candle burned on the table;
	A candle burned.
