*** Louise Bogan (1897 - 1970)


1. BETROTHED

	You have put your two hands upon me, and your mouth,
	You have said my name as a prayer.
	Here where trees are planted by the water
	I have watched your eyes, cleansed from regret,
	And your lips, closed over all that love cannot say,
	
	        My mother remembers the agony of her womb
	        And long years that seemed to promise more than this.
	        She says, “You do not love me,
	        You do not want me,
	        You will go away.”
	
	        In the country whereto I go
	        I shall not see the face of my friend
	        Nor her hair the color of sunburnt grasses;
	        Together we shall not find
	        The land on whose hills bends the new moon
	        In air traversed of birds.
	        
	What have I thought of love?
	I have said, “It is beauty and sorrow.”
	I have thought that it would bring me lost delights, and splendor
	As a wind out of old time . . .
	
	But there is only the evening here,
	And the sound of willows
	Now and again dipping their long oval leaves in the water.


2. MEDUSA

	I had come to the house, in a cave of trees,
	Facing a sheer sky.
	Everything moved,--a bell hung ready to strike,
	Sun and reflection wheeled by.
	
	When the bare eyes were before me
	And the hissing hair,
	Held up at a window, seen through a door.
	The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead
	Formed in the air.
	
	This is a dead scene forever now.
	Nothing will ever stir.
	The end will never brighten it more than this,
	Nor the rain blur.
	
	The water will always fall, and will not fall,
	And the tipped bell make no sound.
	The grass will always be growing for hay
	Deep on the ground.
	
	And I shall stand here like a shadow
	Under the great balanced day,
	My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind,
	And does not drift away.


3. WORDS FOR DEPARTURE

	I
	
	Nothing was remembered, nothing forgotten.
	When we awoke, wagons were passing on the warm summer   
	         pavements,
	The window-sills were wet from rain in the night,
	Birds scattered and settled over chimneypots
	As among grotesque trees.
	
	Nothing was accepted, nothing looked beyond.
	Slight-voiced bells separated hour from hour,
	The afternoon sifted coolness
	And people drew together in streets becoming deserted.
	There was a moon, and light in a shop-front,
	And dusk falling like precipitous water.
	
	Hand clasped hand
	Forehead still bowed to forehead--
	Nothing was lost, nothing possessed
	There was no gift nor denial.
	
	
	II
	
	I have remembered you.
	You were not the town visited once,
	Nor the road falling behind running feet.
	
	You were as awkward as flesh
	And lighter than frost or ashes.
	
	You were the rind,
	And the white-juiced apple,
	The song, and the words waiting for music.
	
	
	III
	
	You have learned the beginning;
	Go from mine to the other.
	
	Be together; eat, dance, despair,
	Sleep, be threatened, endure.
	You will know the way of that.
	
	But at the end, be insolent;
	Be absurd--strike the thing short off;
	Be mad--only do not let talk
	Wear the bloom from silence.
	
	And go away without fire or lantern
	Let there be some uncertainty about your departure.
