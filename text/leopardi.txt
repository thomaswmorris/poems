*** Giacomo Leopardi (1798 - 1837)


1. CALM AFTER STORM

	e storm hath passed;
	I hear the birds rejoice; the hen,
	Returned into the road again,
	Her cheerful notes repeats. The sky serene
	Is, in the west, upon the mountain seen:
	The country smiles; bright runs the silver stream.
	Each heart is cheered; on every side revive
	The sounds, the labors of the busy hive.
	The workman gazes at the watery sky,
	As standing at the door he sings,
	His work in hand; the little wife goes forth,
	And in her pail the gathered rain-drops brings;
	The vendor of his wares, from lane to lane,
	Begins his daily cry again.
	The sun returns, and with his smile illumes
	The villas on the neighboring hills;
	Through open terraces and balconies,
	The genial light pervades the cheerful rooms;
	And, on the highway, from afar are heard
	The tinkling of the bells, the creaking wheels
	Of waggoner, his journey who resumes.
	
	Cheered is each heart.
	Whene’er, as now, doth life appear
	A thing so pleasant and so dear?
	When, with such love,
	Does man unto his books or work return?
	Or on himself new tasks impose?
	When is he less regardful of his woes?
	O pleasure, born of pain!
	O idle joy, and vain,
	Fruit of the fear just passed, which shook
	The wretch who life abhorred, yet dreaded death!
	With which each neighbor held his breath,
	Silent, and cold, and wan,
	Affrighted sore to see
	The lightnings, clouds, and winds arrayed,
	To do us injury!
	
	O Nature courteous!
	These are thy boons to us,
	These the delights to mortals given!
	Escape from pain, best gift of heaven!
	Thou scatterest sorrows with a bounteous hand;
	Grief springs spontaneous;
	If, by some monstrous growth, miraculous,
	Pleasure at times is born of pain,
	It is a precious gain!
	O human race, unto the gods so dear!
	Too happy, in a respite brief
	From any grief!
	Then only blessed,
	When Death releases thee unto thy rest!


2. THE EVENING OF THE HOLIDAY

	The night is mild and clear, and without wind, 
	And o’er the roofs, and o’er the gardens round 
	The moon shines soft, and from afar reveals 
	Each mountain-peak serene. O lady, mine, 
	Hushed now is every path, and few and dim 
	The lamps that glimmer through the balconies. 
	Thou sleepest! in thy quiet rooms, how light 
	And easy is thy sleep! No care thy heart 
	Consumes; and little dost thou know or think, 
	How deep a wound thou in my heart hast made. 
	Thou sleepest; I to yonder heaven turn, 
	That seems to greet me with a loving smile, 
	And to that Nature old, omnipotent, 
	That doomed me still to suffer. ‘I to thee 
	All hope deny,’ she said, ‘e’en hope; nor may 
	Those eyes of thine e’er shine, save through their tears.’ 
	
	This was a holiday; its pleasures o’er, 
	Thou seek’st repose; and happy in thy dreams 
	Recallest those whom thou hast pleased to-day, 
	And those who have pleased thee: not I, indeed,-- 
	I hoped it not,--unto thy thoughts occur. 
	Meanwhile, I ask, how much of life remains 
	To me; and on the earth I cast myself, 
	And cry, and groan. How wretched are my days, 
	And still so young! Hark, on the road I hear, 
	Not far away, the solitary song 
	Of workman, who returns at this late hour, 
	In merry mood, unto his humble home; 
	And in my heart a cruel pang I feel, 
	At thought, how all things earthly pass away, 
	And leave no trace behind. This festal day 
	Hath fled; a working-day now follows it, 
	And all, alike, are swept away by Time. 
	Where is the glory of the antique nations now? 
	Where now the fame of our great ancestors? 
	The empire vast of Rome, the clash of arms? 
	Now all is peace and silence, all the world 
	At rest; their very names are heard no more. 
	E’en from my earliest years, when we 
	Expect so eagerly a holiday, 
	The moment it was past, I sought my couch, 
	Wakeful and sad; and at the midnight hour, 
	When I the song heard of some passer-by, 
	That slowly in the distance died away, 
	The same deep anguish felt I in my heart.


3. THE INFINITE

	This solitary hill has always been dear to me 
	And this hedge, which prevents me from seeing most of 
	The endless horizon. 
	But when I sit and gaze, I imagine, in my thoughts 
	Endless spaces beyond the hedge, 
	An all encompassing silence and a deeply profound quiet, 
	To the point that my heart is almost overwhelmed. 
	And when I hear the wind rustling through the trees 
	I compare its voice to the infinite silence. 
	And eternity occurs to me, and all the ages past, 
	And the present time, and its sound. 
	Amidst this immensity my thought drowns: 
	And to founder in this sea is sweet to me. 


4. TO SYLVIA

	O Sylvia, dost thou remember still 
	That period of thy mortal life, 
	When beauty so bewildering 
	Shone in thy laughing, glancing eyes, 
	As thou, so merry, yet so wise, 
	Youth’s threshold then wast entering? 
	
	How did the quiet rooms, 
	And all the paths around, 
	With thy perpetual song resound, 
	As thou didst sit, on woman’s work intent, 
	Abundantly content 
	With the vague future, floating on thy mind! 
	Thy custom thus to spend the day 
	In that sweet time of youth and May! 
	
	How could I, then, at times, 
	In those fair days of youth, 
	The only happy days I ever knew, 
	My hard tasks dropping, or my careless rhymes, 
	My station take, on father’s balcony, 
	And listen to thy voice’s melody, 
	And watch thy hands, as they would deftly fly 
	O’er thy embroidery! 
	I gazed upon the heaven serene, 
	The sun-lit paths, the orchards green, 
	The distant mountain here, 
	And there, the far-off sea. 
	Ah, mortal tongue cannot express 
	What then I felt of happiness! 
	
	What gentle thoughts, what hopes divine, 
	What loving hearts, O Sylvia mine! 
	In what bright colors then portrayed 
	Were human life and fate! 
	Oh, when I think of such fond hopes betrayed, 
	A feeling seizes me 
	Of bitterness and misery, 
	And tenfold is my grief renewed! 
	O Nature, why this treachery? 
	Why thus, with broken promises, 
	Thy children’s hearts delude? 
	
	Thou, ere the grass was touched with winter’s frost, 
	By fell disease attacked and overcome, 
	O tender plant, didst die! 
	The flower of thy days thou ne’er didst see; 
	Nor did thy soft heart move 
	Now of thy raven locks the tender praise, 
	Now of thy eyes, so loving and so shy; 
	Nor with thee, on the holidays, 
	Did thy companions talk of love. 
	
	So perished, too, erelong, 
	My own sweet hope; 
	So too, unto my years 
	Did Fate their youth deny. 
	Alas, alas the day, 
	Lamented hope, companion dear, 
	How hast thou passed away! 
	Is _this_ that world? These the delights, 
	The love, the labors, the events, 
	Of which we once so fondly spoke? 
	And must _all_ mortals wear this weary yoke? 
	Ah, when the truth appeared, 
	It better seemed to die! 
	Cold death, the barren tomb, didst thou prefer 
	To harsh reality.


5. THE VILLAGE SATURDAY NIGHT

	The damsel from the field returns, 
	The sun is sinking in the west; 
	Her bundle on her head she sets, 
	And in her hand she bears 
	A bunch of roses and of violets. 
	To-morrow is a holiday, 
	And she, as usual, must them wear 
	Upon her bodice, in her hair. 
	The old crone sits among her mates, 
	Upon the stairs, and spins; 
	And, looking at the fading light, 
	Of good old-fashioned times she prates, 
	When she, too, dressed for holidays, 
	And with light heart, and limb as light, 
	Would dance at night 
	With the companions of her merry days. 
	The twilight shades around us close, 
	The sky to deepest blue is turned; 
	From hills and roofs the shadows fall, 
	And the new moon her face of silver shows. 
	And now the cheerful bell 
	Proclaims the coming festival. 
	By its familiar voice 
	How every heart is cheered! 
	The children all in troops, 
	Around the little square 
	Go, leaping here and there, 
	And make a joyful sound. 
	Meanwhile the ploughman, whistling, returns 
	Unto his humble nest, 
	And thinks with pleasure of his day of rest. 
	
	Then, when all other lights are out, 
	And all is silent round, 
	The hammer’s stroke we hear, 
	We hear the saw of carpenter, 
	Who with closed doors his vigil keeps, 
	Toils o’er his lamp and strives so hard, 
	His work to finish ere the dawn appear. 
	
	The dearest day of all the week 
	Is this, of hope and joy so full; 
	To-morrow, sad and dull, 
	The hours will bring, for each must in his thought 
	His customary task-work seek. 
	
	Thou little, sportive boy, 
	This blooming age of thine 
	Is like to-day, so full of joy; 
	And is the day, indeed, 
	That must the sabbath of thy life precede. 
	
	Enjoy, it, then, my darling child, 
	Nor speed the flying hours! 
	I say to thee no more: 
	Alas, in this sad world of ours, 
	How far exceeds the holiday, 
	The day that goes before!
