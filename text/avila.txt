*** Teresa of Ávila (1515 - 1582)


1. LAUGHTER CAME FROM EVERY BRICK

	Just these two words He spoke
	changed my life,
	“Enjoy Me.”
	What a burden I thought I was to carry--
	a crucifix, as did He.
	Love once said to me, “I know a song,
	would you like to hear it?”
	And laughter came from every brick in the street
	and from every pore
	in the sky.
	After a night of prayer, He
	changed my life when
	He sang,
	“Enjoy Me.”



2. LET NOTHING DISTURB YOU

	Let nothing disturb you,
	Let nothing frighten you,
	All things pass away:
	God never changes.
	Patience obtains all things.
	He who has God
	Finds he lacks nothing;
	God alone suffices.
