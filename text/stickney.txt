*** Trumbull Stickney (1874 - 1904)


1. IN THE PAST

	There lies a somnolent lake
	Under a noiseless sky,
	Where never the mornings break
	Nor the evenings die.
	
	Mad flakes of colour 
	Whirl on its even face
	Iridescent and streaked with pallour;
	And, warding the silent place,
	
	The rocks rise sheer and gray
	From the sedgeless brink to the sky
	Dull-lit with the light of pale half-day
	Thro’ a void space and dry.
	
	And the hours lag dead in the air 
	With a sense of coming eternity
	To the heart of the lonely boatman there:
	That boatman am I,
	
	I, in my lonely boat,
	A waif on the somnolent lake,
	Watching the colours creep and float
	With the sinuous track of a snake.
	
	Now I lean o’er the side
	And lazy shades in the water see,
	Lapped in the sweep of a sluggish tide
	Crawled in from the living sea;
	
	And next I fix mine eyes,
	So long that the heart declines,
	On the changeless face of the open skies
	Where no star shines;
	
	And now to the rocks I turn,
	To the rocks, around
	That lie like walls of a circling sun
	Wherein lie bound
	
	The waters that feel my powerless strength
	And meet my homeless oar
	Labouring over their ashen length
	Never to find a shore.
	
	But the gleam still skims
	At times on the somnolent lake,
	And a light there is that swims
	With the whirl of a snake;
	
	And tho’ dead be the hours i’ the air,
	And dayless the sky,
	The heart is alive of the boatman there:
	That boatman am I.


2. LEAVE HIM NOW QUIET BY THE WAY

	Leave him now quiet by the way 
	To rest apart. 
	I know what draws him to the dust alway 
	And churns him in the builder’s lime: 
	He has the fright of time. 
	
	I heard it knocking in his breast 
	A minute since; 
	His human eyes did wince, 
	He stubborned like the massive slaughter beast 
	And as a thing o’erwhelmed with sound 
	Stood bolted to the ground. 
	
	Leave him, for rest alone can cure-- 
	If cure there be-- 
	This waif upon the sea. 
	He is of those who slanted the great door 
	And listened--wretched little lad-- 
	To what they said.


3. MAN STOOD ALONE

	And, the last day being come, Man stood alone 
	Ere sunrise on the world’s dismantled verge, 
	Awaiting how from everywhere should urge 
	The Coming of the Lord. And, behold, none 
	
	Did come,--but indistinct from every realm 
	Of earth and air and water, growing more 
	And louder, shriller, heavier, a roar 
	Up the dun atmosphere did overwhelm 
	
	His ears; and as he looked affrighted round 
	Every manner of beast innumerable 
	All thro’ the shadows crying grew, until 
	The wailing was like grass upon the ground. 
	
	Asudden then within his human side 
	Their anguish, since the goad he wielded first, 
	And, since he gave them not to drink, their thirst, 
	Darted compressed and vital.--As he died, 
	
	Low in the East now lighting gorgeously 
	He saw the last sea-serpent iris-mailed 
	Which, with a spear transfixèd, yet availed 
	To pluck the sun down into the dead sea.


4. MNEMOSYNE

	It’s autumn in the country I remember. 
	How warm a wind blew here about the ways! 
	And shadows on the hillside lay to slumber
	During the long sun-sweetened summer-days. 
	It’s cold abroad the country I remember. 
	The swallows veering skimmed the golden grain
	At midday with a wing aslant and limber; 
	And yellow cattle browsed upon the plain. 
	It’s empty down the country I remember. 
	
	I had a sister lovely in my sight: 
	Her hair was dark, her eyes were very sombre; 
	We sang together in the woods at night. 
	
	It’s lonely in the country I remember. 
	
	The babble of our children fills my ears, 
	And on our hearth I stare the perished ember
	To flames that show all starry thro’ my tears. 
	
	It’s dark about the country I remember.
	
	There are the mountains where I lived. The path
	Is slushed with cattle-tracks and fallen timber, 
	The stumps are twisted by the tempests’ wrath.
	
	But that I knew these places are my own, 
	I’d ask how came such wretchedness to cumber
	The earth, and I to people it alone.
