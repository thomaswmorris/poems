*** Henry David Thoreau (1817 - 1862)


1. CONSCIENCE

	Conscience is instinct bred in the house,
	Feeling and Thinking propagate the sin
	By an unnatural breeding in and in.
	I say, Turn it out doors,
	Into the moors.
	I love a life whose plot is simple,
	And does not thicken with every pimple,
	A soul so sound no sickly conscience binds it,
	That makes the universe no worse than ‘t finds it.
	I love an earnest soul,
	Whose mighty joy and sorrow
	Are not drowned in a bowl,
	And brought to life to-morrow;
	That lives one tragedy,
	And not seventy;
	A conscience worth keeping;
	Laughing not weeping;
	A conscience wise and steady,
	And forever ready;
	Not changing with events,
	Dealing in compliments;
	A conscience exercised about
	Large things, where one may doubt.
	I love a soul not all of wood,
	Predestinated to be good,
	But true to the backbone
	Unto itself alone,
	And false to none;
	Born to its own affairs,
	Its own joys and own cares;
	By whom the work which God begun
	Is finished, and not undone;
	Taken up where he left off,
	Whether to worship or to scoff;
	If not good, why then evil,
	If not good god, good devil.
	Goodness! you hypocrite, come out of that,
	Live your life, do your work, then take your hat.
	I have no patience towards
	Such conscientious cowards.
	Give me simple laboring folk,
	Who love their work,
	Whose virtue is song
	To cheer God along.


2. I AM THE AUTUMNAL SUN

	Sometimes a mortal feels in himself Nature
	--not his Father but his Mother stirs
	within him, and he becomes immortal with her
	immortality. From time to time she claims
	kindredship with us, and some globule
	from her veins steals up into our own.
	
	I am the autumnal sun,
	With autumn gales my race is run;
	When will the hazel put forth its flowers,
	Or the grape ripen under my bowers?
	When will the harvest or the hunter’s moon
	Turn my midnight into mid-noon?
	I am all sere and yellow,
	And to my core mellow.
	The mast is dropping within my woods,
	The winter is lurking within my moods,
	And the rustling of the withered leaf
	Is the constant music of my grief . . .


3. LOW-ANCHORED CLOUD

	Low-anchored cloud,
	Newfoundland air,
	Fountain-head and source of rivers,
	Dew-cloth, dream-drapery,
	And napkin spread by fays;
	Drifting meadow of the air,
	Where bloom the daisied banks and violets,
	And in whose fenny labyrinth
	The bittern booms and heron wades;
	Spirit of lakes and seas and rivers,
	Bear only perfumes and the scent
	Of healing herbs to just men’s fields!


4. WINTER MEMORIES

	Within the circuit of this plodding life
	There enter moments of an azure hue,
	Untarnished fair as is the violet
	Or anemone, when the spring stew them
	By some meandering rivulet, which make
	The best philosophy untrue that aims
	But to console man for his grievances.
	I have remembered when the winter came,
	High in my chamber in the frosty nights,
	When in the still light of the cheerful moon,
	On the every twig and rail and jutting spout,
	The icy spears were adding to their length
	Against the arrows of the coming sun,
	How in the shimmering noon of winter past
	Some unrecorded beam slanted across
	The upland pastures where the Johnwort grew;
	Or heard, amid the verdure of my mind,
	The bee’s long smothered hum, on the blue flag
	Loitering amidst the mead; or busy rill,
	Which now through all its course stands still and dumb
	Its own memorial,--purling at its play
	Along the slopes, and through the meadows next,
	Until its youthful sound was hushed at last
	In the staid current of the lowland stream;
	Or seen the furrows shine but late upturned,
	And where the fieldfare followed in the rear,
	When all the fields around lay bound and hoar
	Beneath a thick integument of snow.
	So by God’s cheap economy made rich
	To go upon my winter’s task again.
