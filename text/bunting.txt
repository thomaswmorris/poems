*** Basil Bunting (1900 - 1985)


1. THE EARTHY SHIELDS

	Lavender and contorted
	Only and lavender
	Outrageous and very
	
	This flipper may back and
	beckon, but it
	is absurdly hidden
	Into a streamed fly a short man
	has seemed contorted
	Formless as a
	hay, more formless than shield
	
	The rain saying our
	face, its own calling skin
	Appeal has rotted in our curved
	bank
	Gloom is so homeward-bound
	it has mourned it
	Hearing an earthy gross year from under
	old decent water
	Our hand thickening, motionless
	and farcical, our arm rotting 


2. NOTHING

	Nothing
	substance utters or time
	stills and restrains
	joins design and
	
	supple measure deftly
	as thought’s intricate polyphonic
	score dovetails with the tread
	sensuous things
	keep in our consciousness.
	
	Celebrate man’s craft
	and the word spoken in shapeless night, the
	sharp tool paring away
	waste and the forms
	cut out of mystery!
	
	When taut string’s note
	passes ears’ reach or red rays or violet
	fade, strong over unseen
	forces the word
	ranks and enumerates . . .
	
	mimes clouds condensed
	and hewn hills and bristling forests,
	steadfast corn in its season
	and the seasons
	in their due array,
	
	life of man’s own body
	and death . . .
	The sound thins into melody,
	discourse narrowing, craft
	failing, design
	petering out.
	
	Ears heavy to breeze of speech and
	thud of the ictus.
