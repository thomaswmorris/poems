*** Lewis Carroll (1832 - 1898)


1. ATALANTA IN CAMDEN-TOWN

	        Ay, ’twas here, on this spot,
	           In that summer of yore,
	        Atalanta did not
	           Vote my presence a bore,
	Nor reply to my tenderest talk “She had
	     heard all that nonsense before.”
	
	        She’d the brooch I had bought
	           And the necklace and sash on,
	        And her heart, as I thought,
	           Was alive to my passion;
	And she’d done up her hair in the style that
	     the Empress had brought into fashion.
	
	        I had been to the play
	           With my pearl of a Peri--
	        But, for all I could say,
	           She declared she was weary,
	That “the place was so crowded and hot, and
	     she couldn’t abide that Dundreary.”
	
	        Then I thought “Lucky boy!
	           ’Tis for _you_ that she whimpers!”
	        And I noted with joy
	           Those sensational simpers:
	And I said “This is scrumptious!”—a
	     phrase I had learned from the Devonshire shrimpers.
	
	        And I vowed “’Twill be said
	           I’m a fortunate fellow,
	        When the breakfast is spread,
	           When the topers are mellow,
	When the foam of the bride-cake is white,
	     and the fierce orange-blossoms are yellow!”
	
	        O that languishing yawn!
	           O those eloquent eyes!
	        I was drunk with the dawn
	           Of a splendid surmise—
	I was stung by a look, I was slain by a tear,
	     by a tempest of sighs.
	
	        Then I whispered “I see
	           The sweet secret thou keepest.
	        And the yearning for _ME_
	           That thou wistfully weepest!
	And the question is ‘License or Banns?’,
	     though undoubtedly Banns are the cheapest.”
	
	        “Be my Hero,” said I,
	           “And let _me_ be Leander!”
	        But I lost her reply--
	           Something ending with “gander”--
	For the omnibus rattled so loud that no
	     mortal could quite understand her.


2. A BOAT BENEATH A SUNNY SKY

	A boat beneath a sunny sky,
	Lingering onward dreamily
	In an evening of July--
	
	Children three that nestle near,
	Eager eye and willing ear,
	Pleased a simple tale to hear--
	
	Long has paled that sunny sky:
	Echoes fade and memories die:
	Autumn frosts have slain July.
	
	Still she haunts me, phantomwise,
	Alice moving under skies
	Never seen by waking eyes.
	
	Children yet, the tale to hear,
	Eager eye and willing ear,
	Lovingly shall nestle near.
	
	In a Wonderland they lie,
	Dreaming as the days go by,
	Dreaming as the summers die:
	
	Ever drifting down the stream--
	Lingering in the golden gleam--
	Life, what is it but a dream?


3. FAME’S PENNY-TRUMPET

	_Affectionately dedicated to all “original researchers” who pant for
	“endowment.”_
	
	  BLOW, blow your trumpets till they crack,
	     Ye little men of little souls!
	  And bid them huddle at your back--
	     Gold-sucking leeches, shoals on shoals!
	
	  Fill all the air with hungry wails--
	     “Reward us, ere we think or write!
	  Without your Gold mere Knowledge fails
	     To sate the swinish appetite!”
	
	  And, where great Plato paced serene,
	     Or Newton paused with wistful eye,
	  Rush to the chace with hoofs unclean
	     And Babel-clamour of the sty
	
	  Be yours the pay: be theirs the praise:
	     We will not rob them of their due,
	  Nor vex the ghosts of other days
	     By naming them along with you.
	
	  They sought and found undying fame:
	     They toiled not for reward nor thanks:
	  Their cheeks are hot with honest shame
	     For you, the modern mountebanks!
	
	  Who preach of Justice—plead with tears
	     That Love and Mercy should abound--
	  While marking with complacent ears
	     The moaning of some tortured hound:
	
	  Who prate of Wisdom—nay, forbear,
	     Lest Wisdom turn on you in wrath,
	  Trampling, with heel that will not spare,
	     The vermin that beset her path!
	
	  Go, throng each other’s drawing-rooms,
	     Ye idols of a petty clique:
	  Strut your brief hour in borrowed plumes,
	     And make your penny-trumpets squeak.
	
	  Deck your dull talk with pilfered shreds
	     Of learning from a nobler time,
	  And oil each other’s little heads
	     With mutual Flattery’s golden slime:
	
	  And when the topmost height ye gain,
	     And stand in Glory’s ether clear,
	  And grasp the prize of all your pain--
	     So many hundred pounds a year--
	
	  Then let Fame’s banner be unfurled!
	     Sing Pæans for a victory won!
	  Ye tapers, that would light the world,
	     And cast a shadow on the Sun--
	
	  Who still shall pour His rays sublime,
	     One crystal flood, from East to West,
	  When _ye_ have burned your little time
	     And feebly flickered into rest!


4. JABBERWOCKY

	’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
	     Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
	All mimsy were the borogoves, 
	     And the mome raths outgrabe. 
	
	“Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
	     The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
	Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
	     The frumious Bandersnatch!” 
	
	He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
	     Long time the manxome foe he sought— 
	So rested he by the Tumtum tree 
	     And stood awhile in thought. 
	
	And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
	     The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, 
	Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
	     And burbled as it came! 
	
	One, two! One, two! And through and through 
	     The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! 
	He left it dead, and with its head 
	     He went galumphing back. 
	
	“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? 
	     Come to my arms, my beamish boy! 
	O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” 
	     He chortled in his joy. 
	
	’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
	     Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
	All mimsy were the borogoves, 
	     And the mome raths outgrabe.


5. MELANCHOLETTA

	WITH saddest music all day long
	  She soothed her secret sorrow:
	At night she sighed “I fear ’twas wrong
	  Such cheerful words to borrow.
	Dearest, a sweeter, sadder song
	  I’ll sing to thee to-morrow.”
	
	I thanked her, but I could not say
	  That I was glad to hear it:
	I left the house at break of day,
	  And did not venture near it
	Till time, I hoped, had worn away
	  Her grief, for nought could cheer it!
	
	My dismal sister! Couldst thou know
	  The wretched home thou keepest!
	Thy brother, drowned in daily woe,
	  Is thankful when thou sleepest;
	For if I laugh, however low,
	  When thou’rt awake, thou weepest!
	
	I took my sister t’other day
	  (Excuse the slang expression)
	To Sadler’s Wells to see the play
	  In hopes the new impression
	Might in her thoughts, from grave to gay
	  Effect some slight digression.
	
	I asked three gay young dogs from town
	  To join us in our folly,
	Whose mirth, I thought, might serve to drown
	  My sister’s melancholy:
	The lively Jones, the sportive Brown,
	  And Robinson the jolly.
	
	The maid announced the meal in tones
	  That I myself had taught her,
	Meant to allay my sister’s moans
	  Like oil on troubled water:
	I rushed to Jones, the lively Jones,
	  And begged him to escort her.
	
	Vainly he strove, with ready wit,
	  To joke about the weather—
	To ventilate the last ‘_on dit_’--
	  To quote the price of leather--
	She groaned “Here I and Sorrow sit:
	  Let us lament together!”
	
	I urged “You’re wasting time, you know:
	  Delay will spoil the venison.”
	“My heart is wasted with my woe!
	  There is no rest—in Venice, on
	The Bridge of Sighs!” she quoted low
	  From Byron and from Tennyson.
	
	I need not tell of soup and fish
	  In solemn silence swallowed,
	The sobs that ushered in each dish,
	  And its departure followed,
	Nor yet my suicidal wish
	  To _be_ the cheese I hollowed.
	
	Some desperate attempts were made
	  To start a conversation;
	“Madam,” the sportive Brown essayed,
	  “Which kind of recreation,
	Hunting or fishing, have you made
	  Your special occupation?”
	
	Her lips curved downwards instantly,
	  As if of india-rubber.
	“Hounds _in full cry_ I like,” said she:
	  (Oh how I longed to snub her!)
	“Of fish, a whale’s the one for me,
	  _It is so full of blubber_!”
	
	The night’s performance was “King John.”
	  “It’s dull,” she wept, “and so-so!”
	Awhile I let her tears flow on,
	  She said they soothed her woe so!
	At length the curtain rose upon
	  ‘Bombastes Furioso.’
	
	In vain we roared; in vain we tried
	  To rouse her into laughter:
	Her pensive glances wandered wide
	  From orchestra to rafter--
	“_Tier upon tier_!” she said, and sighed;
	  And silence followed after.
	
	  


6. A SEA DIRGE

	THERE are certain things--as, a spider, a ghost,
	  The income-tax, gout, an umbrella for three--
	That I hate, but the thing that I hate the most
	  Is a thing they call the Sea.
	
	Pour some salt water over the floor--
	  Ugly I’m sure you’ll allow it to be:
	Suppose it extended a mile or more,
	  _That’s_ very like the Sea.
	
	Beat a dog till it howls outright--
	  Cruel, but all very well for a spree:
	Suppose that he did so day and night,
	  _That_ would be like the Sea.
	
	I had a vision of nursery-maids;
	  Tens of thousands passed by me--
	All leading children with wooden spades,
	  And this was by the Sea.
	
	Who invented those spades of wood?
	  Who was it cut them out of the tree?
	None, I think, but an idiot could--
	  Or one that loved the Sea.
	
	It is pleasant and dreamy, no doubt, to float
	  With ‘thoughts as boundless, and souls as free’:
	But, suppose you are very unwell in the boat,
	  How do you like the Sea?
	
	There is an insect that people avoid
	  (Whence is derived the verb ‘to flee’).
	Where have you been by it most annoyed?
	  In lodgings by the Sea.
	
	If you like your coffee with sand for dregs,
	  A decided hint of salt in your tea,
	And a fishy taste in the very eggs--
	  By all means choose the Sea.
	
	And if, with these dainties to drink and eat,
	  You prefer not a vestige of grass or tree,
	And a chronic state of wet in your feet,
	  Then—I recommend the Sea.
	
	For _I_ have friends who dwell by the coast--
	  Pleasant friends they are to me!
	It is when I am with them I wonder most
	  That anyone likes the Sea.
	
	They take me a walk: though tired and stiff,
	  To climb the heights I madly agree;
	And, after a tumble or so from the cliff,
	  They kindly suggest the Sea.
	
	I try the rocks, and I think it cool
	  That they laugh with such an excess of glee,
	As I heavily slip into every pool
	  That skirts the cold cold Sea.


7. THREE SUNSETS

	He saw her once, and in the glance,
	 A moment’s glance of meeting eyes,
	His heart stood still in sudden trance:
	 He trembled with a sweet surprise--
	All in the waning light she stood,
	The star of perfect womanhood.
	
	That summer-eve his heart was light:
	 With lighter step he trod the ground:
	And life was fairer in his sight,
	 And music was in every sound:
	He blessed the world where there could be
	So beautiful a thing as she.
	
	There once again, as evening fell
	 And stars were peering overhead,
	Two lovers met to bid farewell:
	 The western sun gleamed faint and red,
	Lost in a drift of purple cloud
	That wrapped him like a funeral-shroud.
	
	Long time the memory of that night--
	 The hand that clasped, the lips that kissed,
	The form that faded from his sight
	 Slow sinking through the tearful mist--
	In dreamy music seemed to roll
	Through the dark chambers of his soul.
	
	So after many years he came
	 A wanderer from a distant shore:
	The street, the house, were still the same,
	 But those he sought were there no more:
	His burning words, his hopes and fears,
	Unheeded fell on alien ears.
	
	Only the children from their play
	 Would pause the mournful tale to hear,
	Shrinking in half-alarm away,
	 Or, step by step, would venture near
	To touch with timid curious hands
	That strange wild man from other lands.
	
	He sat beside the busy street,
	 There, where he last had seen her face:
	And thronging memories, bitter-sweet,
	 Seemed yet to haunt the ancient place:
	Her footfall ever floated near:
	Her voice was ever in his ear.
	
	He sometimes, as the daylight waned
	 And evening mists began to roll,
	In half-soliloquy complained
	 Of that black shadow on his soul,
	And blindly fanned, with cruel care,
	The ashes of a vain despair.
	
	The summer fled: the lonely man
	 Still lingered out the lessening days;
	Still, as the night drew on, would scan
	 Each passing face with closer gaze--
	Till, sick at heart, he turned away,
	And sighed “she will not come to-day.”
	
	So by degrees his spirit bent
	 To mock its own despairing cry,
	In stern self-torture to invent
	 New luxuries of agony,
	And people all the vacant space
	With visions of her perfect face.
	
	Then for a moment she was nigh,
	 He heard no step, but she was there;
	As if an angel suddenly
	 Were bodied from the viewless air,
	And all her fine ethereal frame
	Should fade as swiftly as it came.
	
	So, half in fancy’s sunny trance,
	 And half in misery’s aching void
	With set and stony countenance
	 His bitter being he enjoyed,
	And thrust for ever from his mind
	The happiness he could not find.
	
	As when the wretch, in lonely room,
	 To selfish death is madly hurled,
	The glamour of that fatal fume
	 Shuts out the wholesome living world--
	So all his manhood’s strength and pride
	One sickly dream had swept aside.
	
	Yea, brother, and we passed him there,
	 But yesterday, in merry mood,
	And marveled at the lordly air
	 That shamed his beggar’s attitude,
	Nor heeded that ourselves might be
	Wretches as desperate as he;
	
	Who let the thought of bliss denied
	 Make havoc of our life and powers,
	And pine, in solitary pride,
	 For peace that never shall be ours,
	Because we will not work and wait
	In trustful patience for our fate.
	
	And so it chanced once more that she
	 Came by the old familiar spot:
	The face he would have died to see
	 Bent o’er him, and he knew it not;
	Too rapt in selfish grief to hear,
	Even when happiness was near.
	
	And pity filled her gentle breast
	 For him that would not stir nor speak
	The dying crimson of the west,
	 That faintly tinged his haggard cheek,
	Fell on her as she stood, and shed
	A glory round the patient head.
	
	Ah, let him wake! The moments fly:
	 This awful tryst may be the last.
	And see, the tear, that dimmed her eye,
	 Had fallen on him ere she passed--
	She passed: the crimson paled to gray:
	And hope departed with the day.
	
	The heavy hours of night went by,
	 And silence quickened into sound,
	And light slid up the eastern sky,
	 And life began its daily round--
	But light and life for him were fled:
	His name was numbered with the dead.


8. A VALENTINE

	_Sent to a friend who had complained that I was glad enough to see him
	when he came, but didn’t seem to miss him if he stayed away._
	
	  And cannot pleasures, while they last,
	  Be actual unless, when past,
	  They leave us shuddering and aghast,
	        With anguish smarting?
	  And cannot friends be firm and fast,
	        And yet bear parting?
	
	  And must I then, at Friendship’s call,
	  Calmly resign the little all
	  (Trifling, I grant, it is and small)
	        I have of gladness,
	  And lend my being to the thrall
	        Of gloom and sadness?
	
	  And think you that I should be dumb,
	  And full _dolorum omnium_,
	  Excepting when _you_ choose to come
	        And share my dinner?
	  At other times be sour and glum
	        And daily thinner?
	
	  Must he then only live to weep,
	  Who’d prove his friendship true and deep
	  By day a lonely shadow creep,
	        At night-time languish,
	  Oft raising in his broken sleep
	        The moan of anguish?
	
	  The lover, if for certain days
	  His fair one be denied his gaze,
	  Sinks not in grief and wild amaze,
	        But, wiser wooer,
	  He spends the time in writing lays,
	        And posts them to her.
	
	  And if the verse flow free and fast,
	  Till even the poet is aghast,
	  A touching Valentine at last
	        The post shall carry,
	  When thirteen days are gone and past
	        Of February.
	
	  Farewell, dear friend, and when we meet,
	  In desert waste or crowded street,
	  Perhaps before this week shall fleet,
	        Perhaps to-morrow.
	  I trust to find _your_ heart the seat
	        Of wasting sorrow.


9. THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER

	“The sun was shining on the sea,
	     Shining with all his might:
	He did his very best to make
	     The billows smooth and bright--
	And this was odd, because it was
	     The middle of the night.
	
	The moon was shining sulkily,
	     Because she thought the sun
	Had got no business to be there
	     After the day was done--
	“It’s very rude of him,“ she said,
	     “To come and spoil the fun.”
	
	The sea was wet as wet could be,
	     The sands were dry as dry.
	You could not see a cloud, because
	     No cloud was in the sky:
	No birds were flying overhead--
	     There were no birds to fly.
	
	The Walrus and the Carpenter
	     Were walking close at hand;
	They wept like anything to see
	     Such quantities of sand:
	If this were only cleared away,’
	     They said, it would be grand!’
	
	If seven maids with seven mops
	     Swept it for half a year,
	Do you suppose,‘ the Walrus said,
	     That they could get it clear?’
	I doubt it,‘ said the Carpenter,
	     And shed a bitter tear.
	
	O Oysters, come and walk with us!’
	     The Walrus did beseech.
	A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
	     Along the briny beach:
	We cannot do with more than four,
	     To give a hand to each.’
	
	The eldest Oyster looked at him,
	     But never a word he said:
	The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
	     And shook his heavy head--
	Meaning to say he did not choose
	     To leave the oyster-bed.
	
	But four young Oysters hurried up,
	     All eager for the treat:
	Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
	     Their shoes were clean and neat--
	And this was odd, because, you know,
	     They hadn’t any feet.
	
	Four other Oysters followed them,
	     And yet another four;
	And thick and fast they came at last,
	     And more, and more, and more--
	All hopping through the frothy waves,
	     And scrambling to the shore.
	
	The Walrus and the Carpenter
	     Walked on a mile or so,
	And then they rested on a rock
	     Conveniently low:
	And all the little Oysters stood
	     And waited in a row.
	
	The time has come,‘ the Walrus said,
	     To talk of many things:
	Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
	     Of cabbages--and kings--
	And why the sea is boiling hot--
	     And whether pigs have wings.’
	
	But wait a bit,‘ the Oysters cried,
	     Before we have our chat;
	For some of us are out of breath,
	     And all of us are fat!’
	No hurry!‘ said the Carpenter.
	     They thanked him much for that.
	
	A loaf of bread,‘ the Walrus said,
	     Is what we chiefly need:
	Pepper and vinegar besides
	     Are very good indeed--
	Now if you’re ready, Oysters dear,
	     We can begin to feed.’
	
	But not on us!‘ the Oysters cried,
	     Turning a little blue.
	After such kindness, that would be
	     A dismal thing to do!’
	The night is fine,‘ the Walrus said.
	     Do you admire the view?
	
	It was so kind of you to come!
	     And you are very nice!’
	The Carpenter said nothing but
	     Cut us another slice:
	I wish you were not quite so deaf--
	     I’ve had to ask you twice!’
	
	It seems a shame,‘ the Walrus said,
	     To play them such a trick,
	After we’ve brought them out so far,
	     And made them trot so quick!’
	The Carpenter said nothing but
	     The butter’s spread too thick!’
	
	I weep for you,‘ the Walrus said:
	     I deeply sympathize.’
	With sobs and tears he sorted out
	     Those of the largest size,
	Holding his pocket-handkerchief
	     Before his streaming eyes.
	
	O Oysters,‘ said the Carpenter,
	     You’ve had a pleasant run!
	Shall we be trotting home again?’
	     But answer came there none--
	And this was scarcely odd, because
	     They’d eaten every one.”
