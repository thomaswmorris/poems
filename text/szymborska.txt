*** Wisława Szymborska (1923 - 2012)


1. ADVERTISEMENT

	I’m a tranquilizer.
	I’m effective at home.
	I work in the office.
	I can take exams
	on the witness stand.
	I mend broken cups with care.
	All you have to do is take me,
	let me melt beneath your tongue,
	just gulp me
	with a glass of water.
	
	I know how to handle misfortune,
	how to take bad news.
	I can minimize injustice,
	lighten up God’s absence,
	or pick the widow’s veil that suits your face.
	What are you waiting for--
	have faith in my chemical compassion.
	
	You’re still a young man/woman.
	It’s not too late to learn how to unwind.
	Who said
	you have to take it on the chin?
	
	Let me have your abyss.
	I’ll cushion it with sleep.
	You’ll thank me for giving you
	four paws to fall on.
	
	Sell me your soul.
	There are no other takers.
	
	There is no other devil anymore.



2. BIRTHDAY

	So much world all at once--how it rustles and bustles!
	Moraines and morays and morasses and mussels,
	The flame, the flamingo, the flounder, the feather--
	How to line them all up, how to put them together?
	All the tickets and crickets and creepers and creeks!
	The beeches and leeches alone could take weeks.
	Chinchillas, gorillas, and sarsaparillas--
	Thanks do much, but all this excess of kindness could kill us.
	Where’s the jar for this burgeoning burdock, brooks’ babble,
	Rooks’ squabble, snakes’ quiggle, abundance, and trouble?
	How to plug up the gold mines and pin down the fox,
	How to cope with the linx, bobolinks, strptococs!
	Tale dioxide: a lightweight, but mighty in deeds:
	What about octopodes, what about centipedes?
	I could look into prices, but don’t have the nerve:
	These are products I just can’t afford, don’t deserve.
	Isn’t sunset a little too much for two eyes
	That, who knows, may not open to see the sun rise?
	I am just passing through, it’s a five-minute stop.
	I won’t catch what is distant: what’s too close, I’ll mix up.
	While trying to plumb what the void's inner sense is,
	I'm bound to pass by all these poppies and pansies.
	What a loss when you think how much effort was spent
	perfecting this petal, this pistil, this scent
	for the one-time appearance, which is all they're allowed,
	so aloofly precise and so fragilely proud.



3. CHILDREN OF OUR AGE

	We are children of our age,
	it’s a political age.
	
	All day long, all through the night,
	all affairs--yours, ours, theirs--
	are political affairs.
	
	Whether you like it or not,
	your genes have a political past,
	your skin, a political cast,
	your eyes, a political slant.
	
	Whatever you say reverberates,
	whatever you don’t say speaks for itself.
	So either way you’re talking politics.
	
	Even when you take to the woods,
	you’re taking political steps
	on political grounds.
	
	Apolitical poems are also political,
	and above us shines a moon
	no longer purely lunar.
	To be or not to be, that is the question.
	And though it troubles the digestion
	it’s a question, as always, of politics.
	
	To acquire a political meaning
	you don’t even have to be human.
	Raw material will do,
	or protein feed, or crude oil,
	
	or a conference table whose shape
	was quarreled over for months;
	Should we arbitrate life and death
	at a round table or a square one?
	
	Meanwhile, people perished,
	animals died,
	houses burned,
	and the fields ran wild
	just as in times immemorial
	and less political.



4. ON DEATH, WITHOUT EXAGGERATION

	It can’t take a joke,
	find a star, make a bridge.
	It knows nothing about weaving, mining, farming,
	building ships, or baking cakes.
	
	In our planning for tomorrow,
	it has the final word,
	which is always beside the point.
	
	It can’t even get the things done
	that are part of its trade:
	dig a grave,
	make a coffin,
	clean up after itself.
	
	Preoccupied with killing,
	it does the job awkwardly,
	without system or skill.
	As though each of us were its first kill.
	
	Oh, it has its triumphs,
	but look at its countless defeats,
	missed blows,
	and repeat attempts!
	
	Sometimes it isn’t strong enough
	to swat a fly from the air.
	Many are the caterpillars
	that have outcrawled it.
	
	All those bulbs, pods,
	tentacles, fins, tracheae,
	nuptial plumage, and winter fur
	show that it has fallen behind
	with its halfhearted work.
	
	Ill will won’t help
	and even our lending a hand with wars and coups d’etat
	is so far not enough.
	
	Hearts beat inside eggs.
	Babies’ skeletons grow.
	Seeds, hard at work, sprout their first tiny pair of leaves
	and sometimes even tall trees fall away.
	
	Whoever claims that it’s omnipotent
	is himself living proof
	that it’s not.
	
	There’s no life
	that couldn’t be immortal
	if only for a moment.
	
	Death
	always arrives by that very moment too late.
	
	In vain it tugs at the knob
	of the invisible door.
	As far as you’ve come
	can’t be undone.



5. DREAMS

	Despite the geologists’ knowledge and craft, 
	mocking magnets, graphs, and maps-- 
	in a split second the dream 
	piles before us mountains as stony 
	as real life. 
	
	And since mountains, then valleys, plains 
	with perfect infrastructures. 
	Without engineers, contractors, workers, 
	bulldozers, diggers, or supplies-- 
	raging highways, instant bridges, 
	thickly populated pop-up cities. 
	
	Without directors, megaphones, and cameramen-- 
	crowds knowing exactly when to frighten us 
	and when to vanish. 
	
	Without architects deft in their craft, 
	without carpenters, bricklayers, concrete pourers--
	on the path a sudden house just like a toy, 
	and in it vast halls that echo with our steps 
	and walls constructed out of solid air. 
	
	Not just the scale, it’s also the precision--
	a specific watch, an entire fly, 
	on the table a cloth with cross-stitched flowers, 
	a bitten apple with teeth marks. 
	
	And we--unlike circus acrobats, 
	conjurers, wizards, and hypnotists-- 
	can fly unfledged, 
	we light dark tunnels with our eyes, 
	we wax eloquent in unknown tongues, 
	talking not with just anyone, but with the dead. 
	
	And as a bonus, despite our own freedom, 
	the choices of our heart, our tastes, 
	we’re swept away 
	by amorous yearnings for--
	and the alarm clock rings. 
	
	So what can they tell us, the writers of dream books,
	the scholars of oneiric signs and omens, 
	the doctors with couches for analyses-- 
	if anything fits, 
	it’s accidental, 
	and for one reason only, 
	that in our dreamings, 
	in their shadowings and gleamings, 
	in their multiplings, inconceivablings, 
	in their haphazardings and widescatterings 
	at times even a clear-cut meaning 
	may slip through.



6. DRINKING WINE

	He looked at me, bestowing beauty,
	and I took it for my own.
	Happy, I swallowed a star.
	
	I let him invent me
	in the image of the reflection
	in his eyes. I dance, I dance
	in an abundance of sudden wings.
	
	A table is a table, wine is wine
	in a wineglass, which is a wineglass
	and it stands standing on a table
	but I am a phantasm,
	a phantasm beyond belief,
	a phantasm to the core.
	
	I tell him what he wants to hear—
	
	about ants dying of love
	under a dandelion's constellation.
	I swear that sprinkled with wine
	a white rose will sing.
	
	I laugh, and tilt my head
	carefully, as if I were testing
	an invention. I dance, I dance
	in astounded skin, in the embrace
	that creates me.
	
	Eve from a rib, Venus from sea foam,
	Minerva from the head of Jove
	were much more real.
	
	When he's not looking at me,
	I search for my reflection
	on the wall. All I see
	is a nail on which a painting hung.



7. THE END AND THE BEGINNING

	After every war
	someone has to clean up.
	Things won’t
	straighten themselves up, after all.
	
	Someone has to push the rubble
	to the side of the road,
	so the corpse-filled wagons
	can pass.
	
	Someone has to get mired
	in scum and ashes,
	sofa springs,
	splintered glass,
	and bloody rags.
	
	Someone has to drag in a girder
	to prop up a wall.
	Someone has to glaze a window,
	rehang a door.
	
	Photogenic it’s not,
	and takes years.
	All the cameras have left
	for another war.
	
	We’ll need the bridges back,
	and new railway stations.
	Sleeves will go ragged
	from rolling them up.
	
	Someone, broom in hand,
	still recalls the way it was.
	Someone else listens
	and nods with unsevered head.
	But already there are those nearby
	starting to mill about
	who will find it dull.
	
	From out of the bushes
	sometimes someone still unearths
	rusted-out arguments
	and carries them to the garbage pile.
	
	Those who knew
	what was going on here
	must make way for
	those who know little.
	And less than little.
	And finally as little as nothing.
	
	In the grass that has overgrown
	causes and effects,
	someone must be stretched out
	blade of grass in his mouth
	gazing at the clouds.



8. FAMILY ALBUM

	No one in this family has ever died of love.
	No food for myth and nothing magisterial.
	Consumptive Romeos? Juliets diphtherial?
	A doddering second childhood was enough.
	No death-defying vigils, love-struck poses
	over unrequited letters strewn with tears!
	Here, in conclusion, as scheduled, appears
	a portly, pince-nez'd neighbor bearing roses.
	No suffocation-in-the-closet gaffes
	because the cuckold returned home too early!
	Those frills or furbelows, however flounced and whirly,
	barred no one from the family photographs.
	No Bosch-like hell within their souls, no wretches
	found bleeding in the garden, shirts in stains!
	(True, some did die with bullets in their brains,
	for other reasons, though, and on field stretchers.)
	Even this belle with rapturous coiffure
	who may have danced till dawn--but nothing smarter--
	hemorrhaged to a better world, b i e n s u r,
	but not to taunt or hurt y o u, slick-haired partner.
	For others, Death was mad and monumental--
	not for these citizens of a sepia past.
	Their griefs turned into smiles, their days flew fast,
	their vanishing was due to influenza.



9. A FEW WORDS ON THE SOUL

	We have a soul at times.
	No one’s got it non-stop,
	for keeps.
	
	Day after day,
	year after year
	may pass without it.
	
	Sometimes
	it will settle for awhile
	only in childhood’s fears and raptures.
	Sometimes only in astonishment
	that we are old.
	
	It rarely lends a hand
	in uphill tasks,
	like moving furniture,
	or lifting luggage,
	or going miles in shoes that pinch.
	
	It usually steps out
	whenever meat needs chopping
	or forms have to be filled.
	
	For every thousand conversations
	it participates in one,
	if even that,
	since it prefers silence.
	
	Just when our body goes from ache to pain,
	it slips off-duty.
	
	It’s picky:
	it doesn’t like seeing us in crowds,
	our hustling for a dubious advantage
	and creaky machinations make it sick.
	
	Joy and sorrow
	aren’t two different feelings for it.
	It attends us
	only when the two are joined.
	
	We can count on it
	when we’re sure of nothing
	and curious about everything.
	
	Among the material objects
	it favors clocks with pendulums
	and mirrors, which keep on working
	even when no one is looking.
	
	It won’t say where it comes from
	or when it’s taking off again,
	though it’s clearly expecting such questions.
	
	We need it
	but apparently
	it needs us
	for some reason too.



10. A FUNERAL

	“so suddenly, who would've expected this”
	“stress and cigarettes, I was warning him”
	“fair to middling, thanks”
	“unwrap these flowers”
	“his brother snuffed because of his ticker too, must be running in the family”
	“I'd never recognise you with your beard”
	“it's all his fault, he was always up to some funny business”
	“the new one was to give a speech, can't see him, though”
	“Kazek's in Warsaw and Tadek abroad”
	“you're the only wise one here, having an umbrella”
	“it won't help him now that he was the most talented of them all”
	“that's a connecting room. Baśka won't like it”
	“he was right, true, but that's not the reason for”
	“with door varnishing, guess how much”
	“two eggs and a spoonful of sugar”
	“none of his business, what was the point then”
	“blue and small sizes only”
	“five times and never a single answer”
	“I'll give your that, I could've, but so could you”
	“so good at least she had that job”
	“I've no idea, must be relatives”
	“the priest, very much like Belmondo”
	“I've never been to this part of the cemetery”
	“I saw him in my dream last week, must've been a premonition”
	“pretty, that little daughter”
	“we're all going to end up this way”
	“give mine to the widow, I've got to hurry to”
	“but still it sounded more solemn in Latin”
	“you can't turn back the clock”
	“goodbye”
	“how about a beer”
	“give me a ring, we'll have a chat”
	“number four or number twelve”
	“me, this way”
	“we, that way”.



11. GOING HOME

	He came home. Said nothing.
	It was clear, though, that something had gone wrong.
	He lay down fully dressed.
	Pulled the blanket over his head.
	Tucked up his knees.
	He’s nearly forty, but not at the moment.
	He exists just as he did inside his mother’s womb,
	clad in seven walls of skin, in sheltered darkness.
	Tomorrow he’ll give a lecture
	on homeostasis in metagalactic cosmonautics.
	For now, though, he has curled up and gone to sleep.



12. A GREAT MAN'S HOUSE

	It was written in marble in golden letters:
	here a great man lived and worked and died.
	He laid the gravel for these paths personally.
	This bench--do not touch--he chiseled by himself out of stone.
	And--careful, three steps--we're going inside.
	
	He made it into the world at just the right time.
	Everything that had to pass, passed in this house.
	Not in a high rise,
	not in square feet, furnished yet empty,
	amidst unknown neighbors,
	on some fifteenth floor,
	where it's hard to drag school field trips.
	
	In this room he pondered,
	in this chamber he slept,
	and over here he entertained guests.
	Portraits, an armchair, a desk, a pipe, a globe, a flute,
	a worn-out rug, a sun room.
	From here he exchanged nods with his tailor and shoemaker
	who custom made for him.
	
	This is not the same as photographs in boxes,
	dried out pens in a plastic cup,
	a store-bought wardrobe in a store-bought closet,
	a window, from which you can see clouds better than people.
	
	Happy? Unhappy?
	That's not relevant here.
	He still confided in his letters,
	without thinking they would be opened on their way.



13. HUNGER CAMP AT JASLO

	Write it. Write. In ordinary ink
	on ordinary paper: they were given no food,
	they all died of hunger. “All. How many?
	It’s a big meadow. How much grass
	for each one?” Write: I don’t know.
	History counts its skeletons in round numbers.
	A thousand and one remains a thousand,
	as though the one had never existed:
	an imaginary embryo, an empty cradle,
	an ABC never read,
	air that laughs, cries, grows,
	emptiness running down steps toward the garden,
	nobody’s place in the line.
	
	We stand in the meadow where it became flesh,
	and the meadow is silent as a false witness.
	Sunny. Green. Nearby, a forest
	with wood for chewing and water under the bark-
	every day a full ration of the view
	until you go blind. Overhead, a bird-
	the shadow of its life-giving wings
	brushed their lips. Their jaws opened.
	Teeth clacked against teeth.
	At night, the sickle moon shone in the sky
	and reaped wheat for their bread.
	Hands came floating from blackened icons,
	empty cups in their fingers.
	On a spit of barbed wire,
	a man was turning.
	They sang with their mouths full of earth.
	“A lovely song of how war strikes straight
	at the heart.” Write: how silent.
	“Yes.”



14. I AM TOO CLOSE FOR HIM

	I am too close for him to dream about me.
	I'm not flying over him, not fleeing him
	under the roots of trees. I am too close.
	Not with my voice sings the fish in the net.
	Not from my finger rolls the ring.
	I am too close. A large house is on fire
	without my calling for help. Too close
	for a bell dangling from my hair to chime.
	Too close for me to enter as a guest
	before whom the walls part.
	Never again will I die so readily,
	so far beyond the flesh, so inadvertently
	as once in his dream. I am too close,
	too close—I hear the hiss
	and see the glittering husk of that word,
	as I lie immobilized in his embrace. He sleeps,
	more available at this moment
	to the ticket lady of a one-lion traveling circus
	seen but once in his life
	than to me lying beside him.
	Now a valley grows for her in him, ochre-leaved,
	closed off by a snowy mountain
	in the azure air. I am too close
	to fall out of the sky for him. My scream
	might only awaken him. Poor me,
	limited to my own form,
	but I was a birch tree, I was a lizard,
	I emerged from satins and sundials
	my skins shimmering in different colors. I possessed
	the grace to disappear from astonished eyes,
	and that is the rich man's riches. I am too close,
	too close for him to dream about me.
	I slip my arm out from under his sleeping head.
	It's numb, full of imaginary pins and needles.
	And on the head of each, ready to be counted,
	dance the fallen angels.



15. IDENTIFICATION

	It’s good you came--she says.
	You heard a plane crashed on Thursday?
	Well so they came to see me
	about it.
	The story is he was on the passenger list.
	So what, he might have changed his mind.
	They gave me some pills so I wouldn’t fall apart.
	Then they showed me I don’t know who.
	All black, burned except one hand.
	A scrap of shirt, a watch, a wedding ring.
	I got furious, that can’t be him.
	He wouldn’t do that to me, look like that.
	The stores are bursting with those shirts.
	The watch is just a regular old watch.
	And our names on that ring,
	they’re only the most ordinary names.
	It’s good you came. Sit here beside me.
	He really was supposed to get back Thursday.
	But we’ve got so many Thursdays left this year.
	I’ll put the kettle on for tea.
	I’ll wash my hair, then what,
	try to wake up from all this.
	It’s good you came, since it was cold there,
	and him just in some rubber sleeping bag,
	him, I mean, you know, that unlucky man.
	I’ll put the Thursday on, wash the tea,
	since our names are completely ordinary.



16. IN PRAISE OF FEELING BAD ABOUT YOURSELF

	The buzzard never says it is to blame.
	The panther wouldn’t know what scruples mean.
	When the piranha strikes, it feels no shame.
	If snakes had hands, they’d claim their hands were clean.
	
	A jackal doesn’t understand remorse.
	Lions and lice don’t waver in their course.
	Why should they, when they know they’re right?
	
	Though hearts of killer whales may weigh a ton,
	in every other way they’re light.
	
	On this third planet of the sun
	among the signs of bestiality
	a clear conscience is Number One.



17. LOT'S WIFE

	They say I looked back out of curiosity.
	But I could have had other reasons.
	I looked back mourning my silver bowl.
	Carelessly, while tying my sandal strap.
	So I wouldn't have to keep staring at the righteous nape
	of my husband Lot's neck.
	From the sudden conviction that if I dropped dead
	he wouldn't so much as hesitate.
	From the disobedience of the meek.
	Checking for pursuers.
	Struck by the silence, hoping God had changed his mind.
	Our two daughters were already vanishing over the hilltop.
	I felt age within me. Distance.
	The futility of wandering. Torpor.
	I looked back setting my bundle down.
	I looked back not knowing where to set my foot.
	Serpents appeared on my path,
	spiders, field mice, baby vultures.
	They were neither good nor evil now--every living thing
	was simply creeping or hopping along in the mass panic.
	I looked back in desolation.
	In shame because we had stolen away.
	Wanting to cry out, to go home.
	Or only when a sudden gust of wind
	unbound my hair and lifted up my robe.
	It seemed to me that they were watching from the walls of Sodom
	and bursting into thunderous laughter again and again.
	I looked back in anger.
	To savor their terrible fate.
	I looked back for all the reasons given above.
	I looked back involuntarily.
	It was only a rock that turned underfoot, growling at me.
	It was a sudden crack that stopped me in my tracks.
	A hamster on its hind paws tottered on the edge.
	It was then we both glanced back.
	No, no. I ran on,
	I crept, I flew upward
	until darkness fell from the heavens
	and with it scorching gravel and dead birds.
	I couldn't breathe and spun around and around.
	Anyone who saw me must have thought I was dancing.
	It's not inconceivable that my eyes were open.
	It's possible I fell facing the city.



18. LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT

	They both thought
	that a sudden feeling had united them
	This certainty is beautiful,
	Even more beautiful than uncertainty.
	
	They thought they didn't know each other,
	nothing had ever happened between them,
	These streets, these stairs, this corridors,
	Where they could have met so long ago?
	
	I would like to ask them,
	if they can remember--
	perhaps in a revolving door
	face to face one day?
	A “sorry” in the crowd?
	“Wrong number” on the 'phone?
	--but I know the answer.
	No, they don't remember.
	
	How surprised they would be
	For such a long time already
	Fate has been playing with them.
	
	Not quite yet ready
	to change into destiny,
	which brings them nearer and yet further,
	cutting their path
	and stifling a laugh,
	escaping ever further;
	There were sings, indications,
	undecipherable, what does in matter.
	Three years ago, perhaps
	or even last Tuesday,
	this leaf flying
	from one shoulder to another?
	Something lost and gathered.
	Who knows, perhaps a ball already
	in the bushes, in childhood?
	
	There were handles, door bells,
	where, on the trace of a hand,
	another hand was placed;
	suitcases next to one another in the
	left luggage.
	And maybe one night the same dream
	forgotten on walking;
	
	But every beginning
	is only a continuation
	and the book of fate is
	always open in the middle.



19. NOTHING TWICE

	Nothing can ever happen twice.
	In consequence, the sorry fact is
	that we arrive here improvised
	and leave without the chance to practice.
	
	Even if there is no one dumber,
	if you're the planet's biggest dunce,
	you can't repeat the class in summer:
	this course is only offered once.
	
	No day copies yesterday,
	no two nights will teach what bliss is
	in precisely the same way,
	with precisely the same kisses.
	
	One day, perhaps some idle tongue
	mentions your name by accident:
	I feel as if a rose were flung
	into the room, all hue and scent.
	
	The next day, though you're here with me,
	I can't help looking at the clock:
	A rose? A rose? What could that be?
	Is it a flower or a rock?
	
	Why do we treat the fleeting day
	with so much needless fear and sorrow?
	It's in its nature not to stay:
	Today is always gone tomorrow.
	
	With smiles and kisses, we prefer
	to seek accord beneath our star,
	although we're different (we concur)
	just as two drops of water are.



20. THE ONION

	The onion, now that’s something else
	its innards don’t exist
	nothing but pure onionhood
	fills this devout onionist
	oniony on the inside
	onionesque it appears
	it follows its own daimonion
	without our human tears
	
	our skin is just a coverup
	for the land where none dare to go
	an internal inferno
	the anathema of anatomy
	in an onion there’s only onion
	from its top to it’s toe
	onionymous monomania
	unanimous omninudity
	
	at peace, at peace
	internally at rest
	inside it, there’s a smaller one
	of undiminished worth
	the second holds a third one
	the third contains a fourth
	a centripetal fugue
	polypony compressed
	
	nature’s rotundest tummy
	its greatest success story
	the onion drapes itself in it’s
	own aureoles of glory
	we hold veins, nerves, and fat
	secretions’ secret sections
	not for us such idiotic
	onionoid perfections.



21. PLATO, OR WHY

	For unclear reasons
	under unknown circumstances
	Ideal Being ceased to be satisfied.
	
	It could have gone on forever,
	hewn from darkness, forged from light,
	in its sleepy gardens above the world.
	
	Why on earth did it start seeking thrills
	in the bad company of matter?
	
	What use could it have for imitators,
	inept, ill-starred,
	lacking all prospects for eternity?
	
	Wisdom limping
	with a thorn stuck in its heel?
	Harmony derailed
	by roiling waters?
	Beauty
	holding unappealing entrails
	and Good--
	why the shadow
	when it didn't have one before?
	
	There must have been some reason,
	however slight,
	but even the Naked Truth, busy ransacking
	the earth's wardrobe,
	won't betray it.
	
	Not to mention, Plato, those appalling poets,
	litter scattered by the breeze from under statues,
	scraps from that great Silence up on high . . .



22. POETRY READING

	To be a boxer, or not to be there
	at all. O Muse, where are our teeming crowds?
	Twelve people in the room, eight seats to spare
	it's time to start this cultural affair.
	Half came inside because it started raining,
	the rest are relatives. O Muse.
	
	The women here would love to rant and rave,
	but that's for boxing. Here they must behave.
	Dante's Infemo is ringside nowadays.
	Likewise his Paradise. O Muse.
	
	Oh, not to be a boxer but a poet,
	one sentenced to hard shelleying for life,
	for lack of muscles forced to show the world
	the sonnet that may make the high-school reading lists
	with luck. O Muse,
	O bobtailed angel, Pegasus.
	
	In the first row, a sweet old man's soft snore:
	he dreams his wife's alive again. What's more,
	she's making him that tart she used to bake.
	Aflame, but carefully-don't burn his cake!
	we start to read. O Muse.



23. SOME PEOPLE

	Some people fleeing some other people.
	In some country under the sun
	and some clouds.
	
	They leave behind some of their everything,
	sown fields, some chickens, dogs,
	mirrors in which fire now sees itself reflected.
	
	On their backs are pitchers and bundles,
	the emptier, the heavier from one day to the next.
	
	Taking place stealthily is somebody's stopping,
	and in the commotion, somebody's bread somebody's snatching
	and a dead child somebody's shaking.
	
	In front of them some still not the right way,
	nor the bridge that should be
	over a river strangely rosy.
	Around them, some gunfire, at times closer, at times farther off,
	and, above, a plane circling somewhat.
	
	Some invisibility would come in handy,
	some grayish stoniness,
	or even better, non-being
	for a little or a long while.
	
	Something else is yet to happen, only where and what?
	Someone will head toward them, only when and who,
	in how many shapes and with what intentions?
	Given a choice,
	maybe he will choose not to be the enemy and
	leave them with some kind of life.



24. A THANK YOU NOTE

	There is much I owe
	
	to those I do not love.
	
	The relief in accepting
	
	they are closer to another.
	
	Joy that I am not
	
	the wolf to their sheep.
	
	My peace be with them
	
	for with them I am free,
	
	and this, love can neither give,
	
	nor know how to take.
	
	I don't wait for them
	
	from window to door.
	
	Almost as patient
	
	as a sun dial,
	
	I understand
	
	what love does not understand.
	
	I forgive
	
	what love would never have forgiven.
	
	Between rendezvous and letter
	
	no eternity passes,
	
	only a few days or weeks.
	
	My trips with them always turn out well.
	
	Concerts are heard.
	
	Cathedrals are toured.
	
	Landscapes are distinct.
	
	And when seven rivers and mountains
	
	come between us,
	
	they are rivers and mountains
	
	well known from any map.
	
	It is thanks to them
	
	that I live in three dimensions,
	
	in a non-lyrical and non-rhetorical space,
	
	with a shifting, thus real, horizon.
	
	They don't even know
	
	how much they carry in their empty hands.
	
	“I don't owe them anything”,
	
	love would have said
	
	on this open topic.



25. TRUE LOVE

	True love. Is it normal
	is it serious, is it practical?
	What does the world get from two people
	who exist in a world of their own?
	
	Placed on the same pedestal for no good reason,
	drawn randomly from millions but convinced
	it had to happen this way--in reward for what?
	For nothing.
	The light descends from nowhere.
	Why on these two and not on others?
	Doesn't this outrage justice? Yes it does.
	Doesn't it disrupt our painstakingly erected principles,
	and cast the moral from the peak? Yes on both accounts.
	
	Look at the happy couple.
	Couldn't they at least try to hide it,
	fake a little depression for their friends' sake?
	Listen to them laughing--its an insult.
	The language they use--deceptively clear.
	And their little celebrations, rituals,
	the elaborate mutual routines--
	it's obviously a plot behind the human race's back!
	
	It's hard even to guess how far things might go
	if people start to follow their example.
	What could religion and poetry count on?
	What would be remembered? What renounced?
	Who'd want to stay within bounds?
	
	True love. Is it really necessary?
	Tact and common sense tell us to pass over it in silence,
	like a scandal in Life's highest circles.
	Perfectly good children are born without its help.
	It couldn't populate the planet in a million years,
	it comes along so rarely.
	
	Let the people who never find true love
	keep saying that there's no such thing.
	
	Their faith will make it easier for them to live and die.



26. UNDER ONE SMALL STAR

	My apologies to chance for calling it necessity.
	My apologies to necessity if I’m mistaken, after all.
	Please, don’t be angry, happiness, that I take you as my due.
	May my dead be patient with the way my memories fade.
	My apologies to time for all the world I overlook each second.
	My apologies to past loves for thinking that the latest is the first.
	Forgive me, distant wars, for bringing flowers home.
	Forgive me, open wounds, for pricking my finger.
	I apologize for my record of minuets to those who cry from the depths.
	I apologize to those who wait in railway stations for being asleep today at five a.m.
	Pardon me, hounded hope, for laughing from time to time.
	Pardon me, deserts, that I don’t rush to you bearing a spoonful of water.
	And you, falcon, unchanging year after year, always in the same cage,
	your gaze always fixed on the same point in space,
	forgive me, even if it turns out you were stuffed.
	My apologies to the felled tree for the table’s four legs.
	My apologies to great questions for small answers.
	Truth, please don’t pay me much attention.
	Dignity, please be magnanimous.
	Bear with me, O mystery of existence, as I pluck the occasional thread from your train.
	Soul, don’t take offense that I’ve only got you now and then.
	My apologies to everything that I can’t be everywhere at once.
	My apologies to everyone that I can’t be each woman and each man.
	I know I won’t be justified as long as I live,
	since I myself stand in my own way.
	Don’t bear me ill will, speech, that I borrow weighty words,
	then labor heavily so that they may seem light.



27. UTOPIA

	Island where all becomes clear.
	Solid ground beneath your feet.
	
	The only roads are those that offer access.
	
	Bushes bend beneath the weight of proofs.
	
	The Tree of Valid Supposition grows here
	with branches disentangled since time immemorial.
	
	The Tree of Understanding, dazzling straight and simple.
	sprouts by the spring called Now I Get It.
	
	The thicker the woods, the vaster the vista:
	the Valley of Obviously.
	
	If any doubts arise, the wind dispels them instantly.
	
	Echoes stir unsummoned
	and eagerly explain all the secrets of the worlds.
	
	On the right a cave where Meaning lies.
	
	On the left the Lake of Deep Conviction.
	Truth breaks from the bottom and bobs to the surface.
	
	Unshakable Confidence towers over the valley.
	Its peak offers an excellent view of the Essence of Things.
	
	For all its charms, the island is uninhabited,
	and the faint footprints scattered on its beaches
	turn without exception to the sea.
	
	As if all you can do here is leave
	and plunge, never to return, into the depths.
	
	Into unfathomable life.



28. A WORD ON STATISTICS

	Out of every hundred people
	
	those who always know better:
	fifty-two.
	
	Unsure of every step:
	almost all the rest.
	
	Ready to help,

	Always good,
	because they cannot be otherwise:
	four--well, maybe five.

	Harmless alone,
	turning savage in crowds:
	more than half, for sure.
	
	Cruel
	when forced by circumstances:
	it's better not to know,
	not even approximately.
	
	Wise in hindsight:
	not many more
	than wise in foresight.
	
	Getting nothing out of life except things:
	thirty
	(though I would like to be wrong).
	
	Doubled over in pain
	and without a flashlight in the dark:
	eighty-three, sooner or later.
	
	Those who are just:
	quite a few at thirty-five.
	
	But if it takes effort to understand:
	three.
	
	Worthy of empathy:
	ninety-nine.
	
	Mortal:
	one hundred out of one hundred--
	a figure that has never varied yet.
