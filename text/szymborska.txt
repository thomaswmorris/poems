*** Wisława Szymborska (1923 - 2012)


1. CHILDREN OF OUR AGE

	We are children of our age,
	it’s a political age.
	
	All day long, all through the night,
	all affairs--yours, ours, theirs--
	are political affairs.
	
	Whether you like it or not,
	your genes have a political past,
	your skin, a political cast,
	your eyes, a political slant.
	
	Whatever you say reverberates,
	whatever you don’t say speaks for itself.
	So either way you’re talking politics.
	
	Even when you take to the woods,
	you’re taking political steps
	on political grounds.
	
	Apolitical poems are also political,
	and above us shines a moon
	no longer purely lunar.
	To be or not to be, that is the question.
	And though it troubles the digestion
	it’s a question, as always, of politics.
	
	To acquire a political meaning
	you don’t even have to be human.
	Raw material will do,
	or protein feed, or crude oil,
	
	or a conference table whose shape
	was quarreled over for months;
	Should we arbitrate life and death
	at a round table or a square one?
	
	Meanwhile, people perished,
	animals died,
	houses burned,
	and the fields ran wild
	just as in times immemorial
	and less political.


2. THE END AND THE BEGINNING

	After every war
	someone has to clean up.
	Things won’t
	straighten themselves up, after all.
	
	Someone has to push the rubble
	to the side of the road,
	so the corpse-filled wagons
	can pass.
	
	Someone has to get mired
	in scum and ashes,
	sofa springs,
	splintered glass,
	and bloody rags.
	
	Someone has to drag in a girder
	to prop up a wall.
	Someone has to glaze a window,
	rehang a door.
	
	Photogenic it’s not,
	and takes years.
	All the cameras have left
	for another war.
	
	We’ll need the bridges back,
	and new railway stations.
	Sleeves will go ragged
	from rolling them up.
	
	Someone, broom in hand,
	still recalls the way it was.
	Someone else listens
	and nods with unsevered head.
	But already there are those nearby
	starting to mill about
	who will find it dull.
	
	From out of the bushes
	sometimes someone still unearths
	rusted-out arguments
	and carries them to the garbage pile.
	
	Those who knew
	what was going on here
	must make way for
	those who know little.
	And less than little.
	And finally as little as nothing.
	
	In the grass that has overgrown
	causes and effects,
	someone must be stretched out
	blade of grass in his mouth
	gazing at the clouds.


3. GOING HOME

	He came home. Said nothing.
	It was clear, though, that something had gone wrong.
	He lay down fully dressed.
	Pulled the blanket over his head.
	Tucked up his knees.
	He’s nearly forty, but not at the moment.
	He exists just as he did inside his mother’s womb,
	clad in seven walls of skin, in sheltered darkness.
	Tomorrow he’ll give a lecture
	on homeostasis in metagalactic cosmonautics.
	For now, though, he has curled up and gone to sleep.


4. HUNGER CAMP AT JASLO

	Write it. Write. In ordinary ink
	on ordinary paper: they were given no food,
	they all died of hunger. “All. How many?
	It’s a big meadow. How much grass
	for each one?” Write: I don’t know.
	History counts its skeletons in round numbers.
	A thousand and one remains a thousand,
	as though the one had never existed:
	an imaginary embryo, an empty cradle,
	an ABC never read,
	air that laughs, cries, grows,
	emptiness running down steps toward the garden,
	nobody’s place in the line.
	
	We stand in the meadow where it became flesh,
	and the meadow is silent as a false witness.
	Sunny. Green. Nearby, a forest
	with wood for chewing and water under the bark-
	every day a full ration of the view
	until you go blind. Overhead, a bird-
	the shadow of its life-giving wings
	brushed their lips. Their jaws opened.
	Teeth clacked against teeth.
	At night, the sickle moon shone in the sky
	and reaped wheat for their bread.
	Hands came floating from blackened icons,
	empty cups in their fingers.
	On a spit of barbed wire,
	a man was turning.
	They sang with their mouths full of earth.
	“A lovely song of how war strikes straight
	at the heart.” Write: how silent.
	“Yes.”


5. IDENTIFICATION

	It’s good you came--she says.
	You heard a plane crashed on Thursday?
	Well so they came to see me
	about it.
	The story is he was on the passenger list.
	So what, he might have changed his mind.
	They gave me some pills so I wouldn’t fall apart.
	Then they showed me I don’t know who.
	All black, burned except one hand.
	A scrap of shirt, a watch, a wedding ring.
	I got furious, that can’t be him.
	He wouldn’t do that to me, look like that.
	The stores are bursting with those shirts.
	The watch is just a regular old watch.
	And our names on that ring,
	they’re only the most ordinary names.
	It’s good you came. Sit here beside me.
	He really was supposed to get back Thursday.
	But we’ve got so many Thursdays left this year.
	I’ll put the kettle on for tea.
	I’ll wash my hair, then what,
	try to wake up from all this.
	It’s good you came, since it was cold there,
	and him just in some rubber sleeping bag,
	him, I mean, you know, that unlucky man.
	I’ll put the Thursday on, wash the tea,
	since our names are completely ordinary.


6. IN PRAISE OF FEELING BAD ABOUT YOURSELF

	The buzzard never says it is to blame.
	The panther wouldn’t know what scruples mean.
	When the piranha strikes, it feels no shame.
	If snakes had hands, they’d claim their hands were clean.
	
	A jackal doesn’t understand remorse.
	Lions and lice don’t waver in their course.
	Why should they, when they know they’re right?
	
	Though hearts of killer whales may weigh a ton,
	in every other way they’re light.
	
	On this third planet of the sun
	among the signs of bestiality
	a clear conscience is Number One.


7. ON DEATH, WITHOUT EXAGGERATION

	It can’t take a joke,
	find a star, make a bridge.
	It knows nothing about weaving, mining, farming,
	building ships, or baking cakes.
	
	In our planning for tomorrow,
	it has the final word,
	which is always beside the point.
	
	It can’t even get the things done
	that are part of its trade:
	dig a grave,
	make a coffin,
	clean up after itself.
	
	Preoccupied with killing,
	it does the job awkwardly,
	without system or skill.
	As though each of us were its first kill.
	
	Oh, it has its triumphs,
	but look at its countless defeats,
	missed blows,
	and repeat attempts!
	
	Sometimes it isn’t strong enough
	to swat a fly from the air.
	Many are the caterpillars
	that have outcrawled it.
	
	All those bulbs, pods,
	tentacles, fins, tracheae,
	nuptial plumage, and winter fur
	show that it has fallen behind
	with its halfhearted work.
	
	Ill will won’t help
	and even our lending a hand with wars and coups d’etat
	is so far not enough.
	
	Hearts beat inside eggs.
	Babies’ skeletons grow.
	Seeds, hard at work, sprout their first tiny pair of leaves
	and sometimes even tall trees fall away.
	
	Whoever claims that it’s omnipotent
	is himself living proof
	that it’s not.
	
	There’s no life
	that couldn’t be immortal
	if only for a moment.
	
	Death
	always arrives by that very moment too late.
	
	In vain it tugs at the knob
	of the invisible door.
	As far as you’ve come
	can’t be undone.


8. THE ONION

	The onion, now that’s something else
	its innards don’t exist
	nothing but pure onionhood
	fills this devout onionist
	oniony on the inside
	onionesque it appears
	it follows its own daimonion
	without our human tears
	
	our skin is just a coverup
	for the land where none dare to go
	an internal inferno
	the anathema of anatomy
	in an onion there’s only onion
	from its top to it’s toe
	onionymous monomania
	unanimous omninudity
	
	at peace, at peace
	internally at rest
	inside it, there’s a smaller one
	of undiminished worth
	the second holds a third one
	the third contains a fourth
	a centripetal fugue
	polypony compressed
	
	nature’s rotundest tummy
	its greatest success story
	the onion drapes itself in it’s
	own aureoles of glory
	we hold veins, nerves, and fat
	secretions’ secret sections
	not for us such idiotic
	onionoid perfections.


9. UNDER ONE SMALL STAR

	My apologies to chance for calling it necessity.
	My apologies to necessity if I’m mistaken, after all.
	Please, don’t be angry, happiness, that I take you as my due.
	May my dead be patient with the way my memories fade.
	My apologies to time for all the world I overlook each second.
	My apologies to past loves for thinking that the latest is the first.
	Forgive me, distant wars, for bringing flowers home.
	Forgive me, open wounds, for pricking my finger.
	I apologize for my record of minuets to those who cry from the depths.
	I apologize to those who wait in railway stations for being asleep today at five a.m.
	Pardon me, hounded hope, for laughing from time to time.
	Pardon me, deserts, that I don’t rush to you bearing a spoonful of water.
	And you, falcon, unchanging year after year, always in the same cage,
	your gaze always fixed on the same point in space,
	forgive me, even if it turns out you were stuffed.
	My apologies to the felled tree for the table’s four legs.
	My apologies to great questions for small answers.
	Truth, please don’t pay me much attention.
	Dignity, please be magnanimous.
	Bear with me, O mystery of existence, as I pluck the occasional thread from your train.
	Soul, don’t take offense that I’ve only got you now and then.
	My apologies to everything that I can’t be everywhere at once.
	My apologies to everyone that I can’t be each woman and each man.
	I know I won’t be justified as long as I live,
	since I myself stand in my own way.
	Don’t bear me ill will, speech, that I borrow weighty words,
	then labor heavily so that they may seem light.


10. UTOPIA

	Island where all becomes clear.
	Solid ground beneath your feet.
	
	The only roads are those that offer access.
	
	Bushes bend beneath the weight of proofs.
	
	The Tree of Valid Supposition grows here
	with branches disentangled since time immemorial.
	
	The Tree of Understanding, dazzling straight and simple.
	sprouts by the spring called Now I Get It.
	
	The thicker the woods, the vaster the vista:
	the Valley of Obviously.
	
	If any doubts arise, the wind dispels them instantly.
	
	Echoes stir unsummoned
	and eagerly explain all the secrets of the worlds.
	
	On the right a cave where Meaning lies.
	
	On the left the Lake of Deep Conviction.
	Truth breaks from the bottom and bobs to the surface.
	
	Unshakable Confidence towers over the valley.
	Its peak offers an excellent view of the Essence of Things.
	
	For all its charms, the island is uninhabited,
	and the faint footprints scattered on its beaches
	turn without exception to the sea.
	
	As if all you can do here is leave
	and plunge, never to return, into the depths.
	
	Into unfathomable life.
