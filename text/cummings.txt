2. 2 LITTLE WHOS

	2 little whos
	(he and she)
	under are this
	wonderful tree
	
	smiling stand
	(all realms of where
	and when beyond)
	now and here
	
	(far from a grown
	-up i&you-
	ful world of known)
	who and who
	
	(2 little ams
	and over them this
	aflame with dreams
	incredible is)



3. ALL IN GREEN MY LOVE WENT RIDING

	All in green went my love riding
	on a great horse of gold
	into the silver dawn.
	
	four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
	the merry deer ran before.
	
	Fleeter be they than dappled dreams
	the swift sweet deer
	the red rare deer.
	
	Four red roebuck at a white water
	the cruel bugle sang before.
	
	Horn at hip went my love riding
	riding the echo down
	into the silver dawn.
	
	four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
	the level meadows ran before.
	
	Softer be they than slippered sleep
	the lean lithe deer
	the fleet flown deer.
	
	Four fleet does at a gold valley
	the famished arrow sang before.
	
	Bow at belt went my love riding
	riding the mountain down
	into the silver dawn.
	
	four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
	the sheer peaks ran before.
	
	Paler be they than daunting death
	the sleek slim deer
	the tall tense deer.
	
	Four tall stags at a green mountain
	the lucky hunter sang before.
	
	All in green went my love riding
	on a great horse of gold
	into the silver dawn.
	
	four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
	my heart fell dead before.



4. ANYONE LIVED IN A PRETTY HOW TOWN

	anyone lived in a pretty how town
	(with up so floating many bells down)
	spring summer autumn winter
	he sang his didn’t he danced his did.
	
	Women and men(both little and small)
	cared for anyone not at all
	they sowed their isn’t they reaped their same
	sun moon stars rain
	
	children guessed(but only a few
	and down they forgot as up they grew
	autumn winter spring summer)
	that noone loved him more by more
	
	when by now and tree by leaf
	she laughed his joy she cried his grief
	bird by snow and stir by still
	anyone’s any was all to her
	
	someones married their everyones
	laughed their cryings and did their dance
	(sleep wake hope and then)they
	said their nevers they slept their dream
	
	stars rain sun moon
	(and only the snow can begin to explain
	how children are apt to forget to remember
	with up so floating many bells down)
	
	one day anyone died i guess
	(and noone stooped to kiss his face)
	busy folk buried them side by side
	little by little and was by was
	
	all by all and deep by deep
	and more by more they dream their sleep
	noone and anyone earth by april
	wish by spirit and if by yes.
	
	Women and men(both dong and ding)
	summer autumn winter spring
	reaped their sowing and went their came
	sun moon stars rain



5. BECAUSE I LOVE YOU

	because i love you)last night
	
	clothed in sealace
	appeared to me
	your mind drifting
	with chuckling rubbish
	of pearl weed coral and stones;
	
	lifted,and(before my
	eyes sinking)inward,fled;softly
	your face smile breasts gargled
	by death  rowned only
	
	again carefully through deepness to rise
	these your wrists
	thighs feet hands
	
	poising
	      to again utterly disappear;
	rushing gently swiftly creeping
	through my dreams last
	night,all of your
	body with its spirit floated
	(clothed only in
	
	the tide’s acute weaving murmur



6. THE BOYS I MEET ARE NOT REFINED

	the boys i mean are not refined
	they go with girls who buck and bite
	they do not give a fuck for luck
	they hump them thirteen times a night
	  
	one hangs a hat upon her tit
	one carves a cross on her behind
	they do not give a shit for wit
	the boys i mean are not refined
	  
	they come with girls who bite and buck
	who cannot read and cannot write
	who laugh like they would fall apart
	and masturbate with dynamite
	  
	the boys i mean are not refined
	they cannot chat of that and this
	they do not give a fart for art
	they kill like you would take a piss
	  
	they speak whatever’s on their mind
	they do whatever’s in their pants
	the boys i mean are not refined
	they shake the mountains when they dance



7. BUFFALO BILL’S

	Buffalo Bill’s
	defunct
	            who used to
	            ride a watersmooth-silver
	                                                     stallion
	and break onetwothreefourfive pigeonsjustlikethat
	                                                                                Jesus
	he was a handsome man
	                                         and what I want to know is
	how do you like your blue-eyed boy
	Mister Death



8. THE CAMBRIDGE LADIES WHO LIVE IN FURNISHED SOULS

	the Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls 
	are unbeautiful and have comfortable minds 
	(also, with the church’s protestant blessings 
	daughters,unscented shapeless spirited) 
	they believe in Christ and Longfellow, both dead, 
	are invariably interested in so many things--
	at the present writing one still finds 
	delighted fingers knitting for the is it Poles? 
	perhaps. While permanent faces coyly bandy 
	scandal of Mrs. N and Professor D 
	. . . . the Cambridge ladies do not care, above 
	Cambridge if sometimes in its box of 
	sky lavender and cornerless, the 
	moon rattles like a fragment of angry candy 



9. DYING IS FINE BUT DEATH

	dying is fine)but Death
	  
	?o
	baby
	i
	  
	wouldn’t like
	  
	Death if Death
	were
	good:for
	  
	when(instead of stopping to think)you
	  
	begin to feel of it,dying
	’s miraculous
	why?be
	  
	cause dying is
	  
	perfectly natural;perfectly
	putting
	it mildly lively(but
	  
	Death
	  
	is strictly
	scientific
	& artificial &
	  
	evil & legal)
	  
	we thank thee
	god
	almighty for dying
	(forgive us,o life!the sin of Death

11. I CARRY YOUR HEART WITH ME

	i carry your heart with me(i carry it in
	my heart)i am never without it(anywhere
	i go you go,my dear;and whatever is done
	by only me is your doing,my darling)
	                                                     i fear
	no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want
	no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)
	and it’s you are whatever a moon has always meant
	and whatever a sun will always sing is you
	
	here is the deepest secret nobody knows
	(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
	and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows
	higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)
	and this is the wonder that’s keeping the stars apart
	
	i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)



12. I HAVE FOUND WHAT YOU ARE LIKE

	i have found what you are like
	the rain
	
	        (Who feathers frightened fields
	with the superior dust-of-sleep. wields
	
	easily the pale club of the wind
	and swirled justly souls of flower strike
	
	the air in utterable coolness
	
	deeds of gren thrilling light
	                                        with thinned
	newfragile yellows
	
	                          lurch and press
	--in the woods
	                        which
	                                  stutter
	                                            and
	                                                  sing
	And the coolness of your smile is
	stirringofbirds between my arms;but
	i should rather than anything
	have(almost when hugeness will shut
	quietly)almost,
	                      your kiss



13. I LOVE YOU MUCH

	i love you much(most beautiful darling)
	
	more than anyone on the earth and i
	like you better than everything in the sky
	
	--sunlight and singing welcome your coming
	
	although winter may be everywhere
	with such a silence and such a darkness
	noone can quite begin to guess
	
	(except my life)the true time of year--
	
	and if what calls itself a world should have
	the luck to hear such singing(or glimpse such
	sunlight as will leap higher than high
	through gayer than gayest someone’s heart at your each
	
	nearness)everyone certainly would(my
	most beautiful darling)believe in nothing but love



14. I SING OF OLAD GLAD AND BIG

	i sing of Olaf glad and big
	whose warmest heart recoiled at war:
	a conscientious object--or
	
	his wellbelovéd colonel(trig
	westpointer most succinctly bred)
	took erring Olaf soon in hand;
	but--though an host of overjoyed
	noncoms(first knocking on the head
	him)do through icy waters roll
	that helplessness which others stroke
	with brushes recently employed
	anent this muddy toiletbowl,
	while kindred intellects evoke
	allegiance per blunt instruments--
	Olaf(being to all intents
	a corpse and wanting any rag
	upon what God unto him gave)
	responds,without getting annoyed
	“I will not kiss your fucking flag”
	
	straightway the silver bird looked grave
	(departing hurriedly to shave)
	
	but--though all kinds of officers
	(a yearning nation’s blueeyed pride)
	their passive prey did kick and curse
	until for wear their clarion
	voices and boots were much the worse,
	and egged the firstclassprivates on
	his rectum wickedly to tease
	by means of skilfully applied
	bayonets roasted hot with heat--
	Olaf(upon what were once knees)
	does almost ceaselessly repeat
	“there is some shit I will not eat”
	
	our president,being of which
	assertions duly notified
	threw the yellowsonofabitch
	into a dungeon,where he died
	
	Christ(of His mercy infinite)
	i pray to see;and Olaf,too
	
	preponderatingly because
	unless statistics lie he was
	more brave than me:more blond than you.



15. I THANK YOU GOD FOR MOST THIS AMAZING

	i thank You God for most this amazing
	day:for the leaping greenly spirits of trees
	and a blue true dream of sky;and for everything
	which is natural which is infinite which is yes
	
	(i who have died am alive again today,
	and this is the sun’s birthday;this is the birth
	day of life and love and wings:and of the gay
	great happening illimitably earth)
	
	how should tasting touching hearing seeing
	breathing any--lifted from the no
	of all nothing--human merely being
	doubt unimaginable You?
	
	(now the ears of my ears awake and
	now the eyes of my eyes are opened)



16. IF

	If freckles were lovely, and day was night,
	And measles were nice and a lie warn’t a lie,
	    Life would be delight,--
	    But things couldn’t go right    
	    For in such a sad plight
	I wouldn’t be I.
	
	If earth was heaven, and now was hence,
	And past was present, and false was true,
	    There might be some sense    
	    But I’d be in suspense
	    For on such a pretense
	You wouldn’t be you.
	
	If fear was plucky, and globes were square,
	And dirt was cleanly and tears were glee
	    Things would seem fair,--
	    Yet they’d all despair,
	    For if here was there
	We wouldn’t be we.



17. IF EVERYTHING HAPPENS THAT CAN’T BE DONE

	if everything happens that can’t be done
	(and anything’s righter 
	than books
	could plan)
	the stupidest teacher will almost guess
	(with a run 
	skip
	around we go yes)
	there’s nothing as something as one
	
	one hasn’t a why or because or although
	(and buds know better
	than books
	don’t grow)
	one’s anything old being everything new
	(with a what
	which
	around we come who)
	one’s everyanything so
	
	so world is a leaf so tree is a bough
	(and birds sing sweeter
	than books
	tell how)
	so here is away and so your is a my
	(with a down
	up
	around again fly)
	forever was never till now
	
	now i love you and you love me
	(and books are shutter
	than books 
	can be)
	and deep in the high that does nothing but fall
	(with a shout
	each 
	around we go all)
	there’s somebody calling who’s we
	
	we’re anything brighter than even the sun
	(we’re everything greater
	than books
	might mean)
	we’re everanything more than believe
	(with a spin
	leap
	alive we’re alive)
	we’re wonderful one times one



18. IF I

	if i
	
	or anybody don’t
	know where it her his
	
	my next meal’s coming from
	i say to hell with that
	that doesn’t matter (and if
	
	he she it or everybody gets a 
	bellyful without 
	lifting my finger i say to hell
	with that i
	
	say that doesn’t matter) but
	if somebody
	or you are beautiful or 
	deep or generous what 
	i say is
	
	whistle that
	sing that yell that spell
	that out big (bigger than cosmic
	rays war earthquakes famine or the ex
	
	prince of whoses diving into 
	a whatses to rescue miss nobody’s 
	probably handbag) because i say that’s not
	
	swell (get me) babe not (understand me) lousy
	kid that’s something else my sweet (i feel that’s 
	
	true)



19. IF I SHOULD SLEEP WITH A LADY CALLED DEATH

	if I should sleep with a lady called death
	get another man with firmer lips `
	to take your new mouth in his teeth
	(hips pumping pleasure into hips).
	
	Seeing how the limp huddling string
	of your smile over his body squirms
	kissingly, I will bring you  every spring
	handfuls of little normal worms.
	
	Dress deftly your flesh in stupid stuffs,
	phrase the immense weapon of your hair.
	Understanding why his eye laughs,
	I will bring you every year
	
	something which is worth the whole,
	an inch of nothing for your soul.



20. IN JUST

	in Just- 
	spring    when the world is mud- 
	luscious the little 
	lame balloonman 
	whistles    far    and wee 
	
	and eddieandbill come 
	running from marbles and 
	piracies and it’s spring 
	
	when the world is puddle-wonderful 
	
	the queer 
	old balloonman whistles 
	far    and    wee 
	and bettyandisbel come dancing 
	from hop-scotch and jump-rope and 
	
	it’s spring 
	and the goat-footed 
	balloonMan    whistles 
	far 
	and 
	wee



21. IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING

	in spite of everything
	which breathes and moves,since Doom
	(with white longest hands
	neatening each crease)
	will smooth entirely our minds 
	--before leaving my room
	i turn,and(stooping
	through the morning)kiss
	this pillow,dear
	where our heads lived and were.



22. IN TIME OF DAFFODILS

	in time of daffodils(who know
	the goal of living is to grow)
	forgetting why,remember how
	
	in time of lilacs who proclaim
	the aim of waking is to dream,
	remember so(forgetting seem)
	
	in time of roses(who amaze
	our now and here with paradise)
	forgetting if,remember yes
	
	in time of all sweet things beyond
	whatever mind may comprehend,
	remember seek(forgetting find)
	
	and in a mystery to be
	(when time from time shall set us free)
	forgetting me,remember me



23. IT IS AT MOMENTS AFTER I HAVE DREAMED

	it is at moments after i have dreamed
	of the rare entertainment of your eyes,
	when(being fool to fancy)i have deemed
	
	with your peculiar mouth my heart made wise;
	at moments when the glassy darkness holds
	
	the genuine apparition of your smile
	(it was through tears always)and silence moulds
	such strangeness as was mine a little while;
	
	moments when my once more illustrious arms
	are filled with fascination,when my breast
	wears the intolerant brightness of your charms:
	
	one pierced moment whiter than the rest
	
	--turning from the tremendous lie of sleep
	i watch the roses of the day grow deep.



24. IT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE SO

	it may not always be so; and i say
	that if your lips, which i have loved, should touch
	another’s, and your dear strong fingers clutch
	his heart, as mine in time not far away;
	if on another’s face your sweet hair lay
	in such a silence as i know, or such
	great writhing words as, uttering overmuch,
	stand helplessly before the spirit at bay;
	
	if this should be, i say if this should be--
	you of my heart, send me a little word;
	that i may go unto him, and take his hands,
	saying, Accept all happiness from me.
	Then shall i turn my face, and hear one bird
	sing terribly afar in the lost lands.



25. JEHOVAH BURIED, SATAN DEAD

	Jehovah buried,Satan dead,
	do fearers worship Much and Quick;
	badness not being felt as bad,
	itself thinks goodness what is meek;
	obey says toc,submit says tic,
	Eternity’s a Five Year Plan:
	if Joy with Pain shall hand in hock
	who dares to call himself a man?
	
	go dreamless knaves on Shadows fed,
	your Harry’s Tom,your Tom is Dick;
	while Gadgets murder squack and add,
	the cult of Same is all the chic;
	by instruments,both span and spic,
	are justly measured Spic and Span:
	to kiss the mike if Jew turn kike
	who dares to call himself a man?
	
	loudly for Truth have liars pled,click;
	where Boobs are holy,poets mad,
	illustrious punks of Progress shriek;
	when Souls are outlawed,Hearts are sick,
	Hearts being sick,Minds nothing can:
	if Hate’s a game and Love’s a fuck
	who dares to call himself a man?
	
	King Christ,this world is all aleak;
	and lifepreservers there are none:
	and waves which only He may walk
	Who dares to call Himself a man.



26. LITTLE TREE

	little tree 
	little silent Christmas tree 
	you are so little 
	you are more like a flower 
	
	who found you in the green forest 
	and were you very sorry to come away? 
	see          i will comfort you 
	because you smell so sweetly 
	
	i will kiss your cool bark 
	and hug you safe and tight 
	just as your mother would, 
	only don’t be afraid 
	
	look          the spangles 
	that sleep all the year in a dark box 
	dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine, 
	the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads, 
	
	put up your little arms 
	and i’ll give them all to you to hold 
	every finger shall have its ring 
	and there won’t be a single place dark or unhappy 
	
	then when you’re quite dressed 
	you’ll stand in the window for everyone to see 
	and how they’ll stare! 
	oh but you’ll be very proud 
	
	and my little sister and i will take hands 
	and looking up at our beautiful tree 
	we’ll dance and sing 
	”Noel Noel”



27. A MAN WHO HAD FALLEN AMONG THIEVES

	a man who had fallen among thieves
	lay by the roadside on his back
	dressed in fifteenthrate ideas
	wearing a round jeer for a hat 
	
	fate per a somewhat more than less
	emancipated evening
	had in return for consciousness
	endowed him with a changeless grin 
	
	whereon a dozen staunch and leal
	citizens did graze at pause
	then fired by hypercivic zeal
	sought newer pastures or because 
	
	swaddled with a frozen brook
	of pinkest vomit out of eyes
	which noticed nobody he looked
	as if he did not care to rise 
	
	one hand did nothing on the vest
	its wideflung friend clenched weakly dirt
	while the mute trouserfly confessed
	a button solemnly inert. 
	
	Brushing from whom the stiffened puke
	i put him all into my arms
	and staggered banged with terror through
	a million billion trillion stars



28. MY LOVE

	my love
	thy hair is one kingdom
	the king whereof is darkness
	thy forehead is a flight of flowers
	thy head is a quick forest
	filled with sleeping birds
	thy breasts are swarms of white bees
	upon the bough of thy body
	thy body to me is April
	in those armpits is the approach of spring
	thy thighs are white horses yoked to a chariot
	of kings
	they are the striking of a good minstrel
	between them is always a pleasant song
	my love
	thy head is a casket
	of the cool jewel of thy mind
	the hair of thy head is one warrior
	innocent of defeat
	thy hair upon thy shoulders is an army
	with victory and with trumpets
	thy legs are the trees of dreaming
	whose fruit is the very eatage of forgetfulness
	thy lips are satraps in scarlet
	in whose kiss is the combinings of kings
	thy wrists
	are holy
	which are the keepers of the keys of thy blood
	thy feet upon thy ankles are flowers in vases
	of silver
	in thy beauty is the dilemma of flutes
	thy eyes are the betrayal
	of bells comprehended through incense



29. MY SWEET OLD ETCETERA

	my sweet old etcetera
	aunt lucy during the recent 
	
	war could and what
	is more did tell you just
	what everybody was fighting 
	
	for,
	my sister 
	
	Isabel created hundreds
	(and
	hundreds)of socks not to
	mention fleaproof earwarmers
	etcetera wristers etcetera, my
	mother hoped that 
	
	i would die etcetera
	bravely of course my father used
	to become hoarse talking about how it was
	a privilege and if only he
	could meanwhile my 
	
	self etcetera lay quietly
	in the deep mud et 
	
	cetera
	(dreaming,
	et
	cetera, of
	Your smile
	eyes knees and of your Etcetera)



30. O SWEET SPONTANEOUS

	o sweet spontaneous
	earth how often have
	the
	doting
	
	               fingers of
	prurient philosophers pinched
	and
	poked
	
	thee
	, has the naughty thumb
	of science prodded
	thy
	
	          beauty     . how
	often have religions taken
	thee upon their scraggy knees
	squeezing and
	
	buffeting thee that thou mightest conceive
	gods
	     (but
	true
	
	to the incomparable
	couch of death thy
	rhythmic
	lover
	
	          thou answerest
	
	
	them only with
	
	                     spring)



31. OF EVER-EVER LAND I SPEAK

	(of Ever-Ever Land i speak
	sweet morons gather roun’
	who does not dare to stand or sit
	may take it lying down)
	
	down with the human soul
	and anything else uncanned
	for everyone carries canopeners
	in Ever-Ever Land
	
	(for Ever-Ever Land is a place
	that’s as simple as simple can be
	and was built that way on purpose
	by simple people like we)
	
	down with hell and heaven
	and all the religious fuss
	infinity pleased our parents
	one inch looks good to us
	
	(and Ever-Ever Land is a place
	that’s measured and safe and known
	where it’s lucky to be unlucky
	and the hitler lies down with the cohn)
	
	down above all with love
	and everything perverse
	or which makes some feel more better
	when all ought to feel less worse
	
	(but only sameness is normal
	in Ever-Ever Land
	for a bad cigar is a woman
	but a gland is only a gland)



32. PITY THIS BUSY MONSTER, MANUNKIND

	pity this busy monster, manunkind,
	
	not. Progress is a comfortable disease:
	your victim (death and life safely beyond)
	
	plays with the bigness of his littleness
	--electrons deify one razorblade
	into a mountainrange; lenses extend
	unwish through curving wherewhen till unwish
	returns on its unself.
	                         A world of made
	is not a world of born--pity poor flesh
	
	and trees, poor stars and stones, but never this
	fine specimen of hypermagical
	
	ultraomnipotence. We doctors know
	
	a hopeless case if--listen: there’s a hell
	of a good universe next door; let’s go



33. SHE BEING BRAND

	she being Brand
	
	-new;and you
	know consequently a
	little stiff i was
	careful of her and(having
	
	thoroughly oiled the universal
	joint tested my gas felt of
	her radiator made sure her springs were O.
	
	K.)i went right to it flooded-the-carburetor cranked her
	
	up,slipped the
	clutch(and then somehow got into reverse she
	kicked what
	the hell)next
	minute i was back in neutral tried and
	
	again slo-wly;bare,ly nudg.  ing(my
	
	lev-er Right-
	oh and her gears being in
	A 1 shape passed
	from low through
	second-in-to-high like
	greasedlightning)just as we turned the corner of Divinity
	
	avenue i touched the accelerator and give
	
	her the juice,good
	
	      (it
	
	was the first ride and believe i we was
	happy to see how nice she acted right up to
	the last minute coming back down by the Public
	Gardens i slammed on
	
	the
	internalexpanding
	&
	externalcontracting
	brakes Bothatonce and

	to a  dead.
	
	stand-
	;Still)



34. SINCE FEELING IS FIRST

	since feeling is first
	who pays any attention
	to the syntax of things
	will never wholly kiss you; 
	
	wholly to be a fool
	while Spring is in the world 
	
	my blood approves,
	and kisses are a better fate
	than wisdom
	lady i swear by all the flowers. Don’t cry
	--the best gesture of my brain is less than
	your eyelids’ flutter which says 
	
	we are for each other: then
	laugh, leaning back in my arms
	for life’s not a paragraph 
	
	and death i think is no parenthesis



35. SOMEWHERE I HAVE NEVER TRAVELLED

	somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond
	any experience,your eyes have their silence:
	in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,
	or which i cannot touch because they are too near
	
	your slightest look easily will unclose me
	though i have closed myself as fingers,
	you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
	(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose
	
	or if your wish be to close me,i and
	my life will shut very beautifully,suddenly,
	as when the heart of this flower imagines
	the snow carefully everywhere descending;
	
	nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
	the power of your intense fragility:whose texture
	compels me with the color of its countries,
	rendering death and forever with each breathing
	
	(i do not know what it is about you that closes
	and opens;only something in me understands
	the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)
	nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands



36. SPRING IS LIKE A PERHAPS HAND

	Spring is like a perhaps hand 
	(which comes carefully 
	out of Nowhere)arranging 
	a window,into which people look(while 
	people stare
	arranging and changing placing 
	carefully there a strange 
	thing and a known thing here)and
	
	changing everything carefully
	
	spring is like a perhaps 
	Hand in a window 
	(carefully to 
	and fro moving New and 
	Old things,while 
	people stare carefully 
	moving a perhaps 
	fraction of flower here placing 
	an inch of air there)and
	
	without breaking anything.



37. SPRING OMNIPOTENT GODDESS

	SPRING omnipotent goddess Thou
	dost stuff parks
	with overgrown pimply
	chevaliers and gumchewing giggly
	
	damosels Thou dost
	persuade to serenade
	his lady the musical tom-cat
	Thou dost inveigle
	
	into crossing sidewalks the
	unwary june-bug and the frivolous
	angleworm
	Thou dost hang canary birds in parlour windows
	
	Spring slattern of seasons
	you have soggy legs
	and a muddy petticoat
	drowsy
	
	is your hair your
	eyes are sticky with
	dream and you have a sloppy body from
	
	being brought to bed of crocuses
	when you sing in your whisky voice
	the grass rises on the head of the earth
	and all the trees are put on edge
	
	spring
	of the excellent jostle of
	thy hips
	and the superior
	
	slobber of your breasts i
	am so very fond that my
	soul inside of me hollers
	for thou comest
	
	and your hands are the snow and thy
	fingers are the rain
	and your
	feet O your feet
	
	freakish
	feet feet incorrigible
	
	ragging the world



38. WHAT IF MUCH OF A WHICH OF A WIND

	what if a much of a which of a wind
	gives the truth to summer’s lie;
	bloodies with dizzying leaves the sun
	and yanks immortal stars awry?
	Blow king to beggar and queen to seem
	(blow friend to fiend: blow space to time)
	--when skies are hanged and oceans drowned,
	the single secret will still be man 
	
	what if a keen of a lean wind flays
	screaming hills with sleet and snow:
	strangles valleys by ropes of thing
	and stifles forests in white ago?
	Blow hope to terror; blow seeing to blind
	(blow pity to envy and soul to mind)
	--whose hearts are mountains, roots are trees,
	it’s they shall cry hello to the spring 
	
	what if a dawn of a doom of a dream
	bites this universe in two,
	peels forever out of his grave
	and sprinkles nowhere with me and you?
	Blow soon to never and never to twice
	(blow life to isn’t:blow death to was)
	--all nothing’s only our hugest home;
	the most who die, the more we live



39. WHEN SERPENTS BARGAIN

	when serpents bargain for the right to squirm
	and the sun strikes to gain a living wage--
	when thorns regard their roses with alarm
	and rainbows are insured against old age 
	
	when every thrush may sing no new moon in
	if all screech-owls have not okayed his voice
	--and any wave signs on the dotted line
	or else an ocean is compelled to close 
	
	when the oak begs permission of the birch
	to make an acorn--valleys accuse their
	mountains of having altitude--and march
	denounces april as a saboteur 
	
	then we’ll believe in that incredible
	unanimal mankind (and not until)

41. YOU SHALL ABOVE ALL THINGS BE GLAD AND YOUNG

	you shall above all things be glad and young
	For if you’re young,whatever life you wear
	
	it will become you;and if you are glad
	whatever’s living will yourself become.
	Girlboys may nothing more than boygirls need:
	i can entirely her only love
	
	whose any mystery makes every man’s
	flesh put space on;and his mind take off time
	
	that you should ever think,may god forbid
	and (in his mercy) your true lover spare:
	for that way knowledge lies,the foetal grave
	called progress,and negation’s dead undoom.
	
	I’d rather learn from one bird how to sing
	than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance



42. YOUNG WOMEN OF CAMBRIDGE,

	“Gay” is the captivating cognomen of a Young Woman of cambridge, mass.
	to whom nobody seems to have mentioned ye olde freudian wish;
	when i contemplate her uneyes safely ensconced in thick glass
	you try if we are a gentleman not to think of(sh)
	
	the world renowned investigator of paper sailors--argonauta argo
	harmoniously being with his probably most brilliant pupil mated,
	let us not deem it miraculous if their(so to speak)offspring has that largo
	appearance of somebody who was hectocotyliferously propagated
	
	when Miss G touched n.y. our skeleton stepped from his cupboard
	gallantly offering to demonstrate the biggest best busiest city
	and presently found himself rattling for that well known suburb
	the bronx(enlivening an otherwise dead silence with harmless quips, out of Briggs by Kitty)
	
	arriving in an exhausted condition, i purchased two bags of lukewarm peanuts
	with the dime which her mama had generously provided(despite courteous protestations)
	and offering Miss Gay one(which she politely refused)set out gaily for the hyenas
	suppressing my frank qualms in deference to her not inobvious perturbations
	
	unhappily, the denizens of the zoo were that day inclined to be uncouthly erotic
	more particularly the primates--from which with dignity square feet turned abruptly Miss Gay away:
	“on the whole”(if you will permit a metaphor savouring slightly of the demotic)
	Miss Gay had nothing to say to the animals and the animals had nothing to say to Miss Gay
	
	during our return voyage, my pensive companion dimly remarlted something about “stuffed
	fauna” being “very interesting” . . . we also discussed the possibility of rain . . .
	E distant proximity to a Y.W.c.a. she suddenly luffed
	--thanking me; and(stating that she hoped we might “meet again
	sometime”)vanished, gunwale awash. I thereupon loosened my collar
	and dove for the nearest l; surreptitiously cogitating
	the dictum of a new england sculptor(well on in life)re the helen moller
	dancers, whom he considered “elevating--that is, if dancing CAN be elevating”
	
	Miss(believe it or)Gay is a certain Young Woman unacquainted with the libido
	and pursuing a course of instruction at radcliffe college, cambridge, mass.
	i try if you are a gentleman not to sense something un poco putrido
	when we contemplate her uneyes safely ensconced in thick glass
