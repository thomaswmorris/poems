*** E. E. Cummings (1894 - 1962)


1. ALL IN GREEN MY LOVE WENT RIDING

	All in green went my love riding
	on a great horse of gold
	into the silver dawn.
	
	four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
	the merry deer ran before.
	
	Fleeter be they than dappled dreams
	the swift sweet deer
	the red rare deer.
	
	Four red roebuck at a white water
	the cruel bugle sang before.
	
	Horn at hip went my love riding
	riding the echo down
	into the silver dawn.
	
	four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
	the level meadows ran before.
	
	Softer be they than slippered sleep
	the lean lithe deer
	the fleet flown deer.
	
	Four fleet does at a gold valley
	the famished arrow sang before.
	
	Bow at belt went my love riding
	riding the mountain down
	into the silver dawn.
	
	four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
	the sheer peaks ran before.
	
	Paler be they than daunting death
	the sleek slim deer
	the tall tense deer.
	
	Four tall stags at a green mountain
	the lucky hunter sang before.
	
	All in green went my love riding
	on a great horse of gold
	into the silver dawn.
	
	four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
	my heart fell dead before.


2. ANYONE LIVED IN A PRETTY HOW TOWN

	anyone lived in a pretty how town
	(with up so floating many bells down)
	spring summer autumn winter
	he sang his didn’t he danced his did.
	
	Women and men(both little and small)
	cared for anyone not at all
	they sowed their isn’t they reaped their same
	sun moon stars rain
	
	children guessed(but only a few
	and down they forgot as up they grew
	autumn winter spring summer)
	that noone loved him more by more
	
	when by now and tree by leaf
	she laughed his joy she cried his grief
	bird by snow and stir by still
	anyone’s any was all to her
	
	someones married their everyones
	laughed their cryings and did their dance
	(sleep wake hope and then)they
	said their nevers they slept their dream
	
	stars rain sun moon
	(and only the snow can begin to explain
	how children are apt to forget to remember
	with up so floating many bells down)
	
	one day anyone died i guess
	(and noone stooped to kiss his face)
	busy folk buried them side by side
	little by little and was by was
	
	all by all and deep by deep
	and more by more they dream their sleep
	noone and anyone earth by april
	wish by spirit and if by yes.
	
	Women and men(both dong and ding)
	summer autumn winter spring
	reaped their sowing and went their came
	sun moon stars rain


3. THE CAMBRIDGE LADIES WHO LIVE IN FURNISHED SOULS

	the Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls 
	are unbeautiful and have comfortable minds 
	(also, with the church’s protestant blessings 
	daughters,unscented shapeless spirited) 
	they believe in Christ and Longfellow, both dead, 
	are invariably interested in so many things— 
	at the present writing one still finds 
	delighted fingers knitting for the is it Poles? 
	perhaps. While permanent faces coyly bandy 
	scandal of Mrs. N and Professor D 
	.... the Cambridge ladies do not care, above 
	Cambridge if sometimes in its box of 
	sky lavender and cornerless, the 
	moon rattles like a fragment of angry candy 


4. I CARRY YOUR HEART WITH ME

	i carry your heart with me(i carry it in
	my heart)i am never without it(anywhere
	i go you go,my dear;and whatever is done
	by only me is your doing,my darling)
	                                                     i fear
	no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want
	no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)
	and it’s you are whatever a moon has always meant
	and whatever a sun will always sing is you
	
	here is the deepest secret nobody knows
	(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
	and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows
	higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)
	and this is the wonder that’s keeping the stars apart
	
	i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)


5. LITTLE TREE

	little tree 
	little silent Christmas tree 
	you are so little 
	you are more like a flower 
	
	who found you in the green forest 
	and were you very sorry to come away? 
	see          i will comfort you 
	because you smell so sweetly 
	
	i will kiss your cool bark 
	and hug you safe and tight 
	just as your mother would, 
	only don’t be afraid 
	
	look          the spangles 
	that sleep all the year in a dark box 
	dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine, 
	the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads, 
	
	put up your little arms 
	and i’ll give them all to you to hold 
	every finger shall have its ring 
	and there won’t be a single place dark or unhappy 
	
	then when you’re quite dressed 
	you’ll stand in the window for everyone to see 
	and how they’ll stare! 
	oh but you’ll be very proud 
	
	and my little sister and i will take hands 
	and looking up at our beautiful tree 
	we’ll dance and sing 
	”Noel Noel”


6. SPRING OMNIPOTENT GODDESS

	SPRING omnipotent goddess Thou
	dost stuff parks
	with overgrown pimply
	chevaliers and gumchewing giggly
	
	damosels Thou dost
	persuade to serenade
	his lady the musical tom-cat
	Thou dost inveigle
	
	into crossing sidewalks the
	unwary june-bug and the frivolous
	angleworm
	Thou dost hang canary birds in parlour windows
	
	Spring slattern of seasons
	you have soggy legs
	and a muddy petticoat
	drowsy
	
	is your hair your
	eyes are sticky with
	dream and you have a sloppy body from
	
	being brought to bed of crocuses
	when you sing in your whisky voice
	the grass rises on the head of the earth
	and all the trees are put on edge
	
	spring
	of the excellent jostle of
	thy hips
	and the superior
	
	slobber of your breasts i
	am so very fond that my
	soul inside of me hollers
	for thou comest
	
	and your hands are the snow and thy
	fingers are the rain
	and your
	feet O your feet
	
	freakish
	feet feet incorrigible
	
	ragging the world


7. YOU SHALL ABOVE ALL THINGS BE GLAD AND YOUNG

	you shall above all things be glad and young
	For if you’re young,whatever life you wear
	
	it will become you;and if you are glad
	whatever’s living will yourself become.
	Girlboys may nothing more than boygirls need:
	i can entirely her only love
	
	whose any mystery makes every man’s
	flesh put space on;and his mind take off time
	
	that you should ever think,may god forbid
	and (in his mercy) your true lover spare:
	for that way knowledge lies,the foetal grave
	called progress,and negation’s dead undoom.
	
	I’d rather learn from one bird how to sing
	than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance
