*** John of the Cross (1542 - 1591)


1. THE DARK NIGHT

	One dark night,
	fired with love’s urgent longings
	--ah, the sheer grace!--
	I went out unseen,
	my house being now all stilled.
	
	In darkness, and secure,
	by the secret ladder, disguised,
	--ah, the sheer grace!--
	in darkness and concealment,
	my house being now all stilled.
	
	On that glad night
	in secret, for no one saw me,
	nor did I look at anything
	with no other light or guide
	than the One that burned in my heart.
	
	This guided me
	more surely than the light of noon
	to where he was awaiting me
	--him I knew so well--
	there in a place where no one appeared.
	
	O guiding night!
	O night more lovely than the dawn!
	O night that has united
	the Lover with his beloved,
	transforming the Beloved into his Lover.
	
	Upon my flowering breast,
	which I kept wholly for him alone,
	there he lay sleeping,
	and I caressing him
	there in a breeze from the fanning cedars.
	
	When the breeze blew from the turret,
	as I parted his hair,
	it wounded my neck
	with its gentle hand,
	suspending all my senses.
	
	I abandoned and forgot myself,
	laying my face on my Beloved;
	all things ceased; I went out from myself,
	leaving my cares
	forgotten among the lilies.


2. I LIVE YET DO NOT LIVE IN ME

	I live yet do not live in me,
	am waiting as my life goes by,
	and die because I do not die.
	
	No longer do I live in me,
	and without God I cannot live;
	to him or me I cannot give
	my self, so what can living be?
	A thousand deaths my agony
	waiting as my life goes by,
	dying because I do not die.
	
	This life I live alone I view
	as robbery of life, and so
	it is a constant death--with no
	way out until I live with you.
	God, hear me, what I say is true:
	I do not want this life of mine,
	and die because I do not die.
	
	Being so removed from you I say
	what kind of life can I have here
	but death so ugly and severe
	and worse than any form of pain?
	I pity me--and yet my fate
	is that I must keep up this lie,
	and die because I do not die.
	
	The fish taken out of the sea
	is not without a consolation:
	his dying is of brief duration
	and ultimately brings relief.
	Yet what convulsive death can be
	as bad as my pathetic life?
	The more I live the more I die.
	
	When I begin to feel relief
	on seeing you in the sacrament,
	I sink in deeper discontent,
	deprived of your sweet company.
	Now everything compels my grief:
	I want--yet can’t--see you nearby,
	and die because I do not die.
	
	Although I find my pleasure, Sir,
	in hope of someday seeing you,
	I see that I can lose you too,
	which makes my pain doubly severe,
	and so I live in darkest fear,
	and hope, wait as life goes by,
	dying because I do not die.
	
	Deliver me from death, my God,
	and give me life; now you have wound
	a rope about me; harshly bound
	I ask you to release the cord.
	See how I die to see you, Lord,
	and I am shattered where I lie,
	dying because I do not die.
	
	My death will trigger tears in me,
	and I shall mourn my life: a day
	annihilated by the way
	I fail and sin relentlessly.
	O Father God, when will it be
	that I can say without a lie:
	I live because I do not die?


3. THE SPIRITUAL CANTICLE

	Where have you fled and vanished, 
	Beloved, since you left me here to moan? 
	Deer-like you leaped; then, banished 
	and wounded by my own, 
	I followed you with cries, but you had flown.
	
	Shepherds, if you discover, 
	going about this knoll to tend your sheep, 
	the dwelling of that lover 
	whose memory I keep, 
	tell him I sicken unto death and weep.
	
	To seek him, I shall scour 
	these trackless woods to where the rivers flow--
	not stop to pick a flower, 
	not run from beasts--but go 
	past every fort and border that I know.
	
	O forests darkly glooming, 
	seeded by my beloved’s very hand! 
	O pasture richly blooming, 
	you flower-jeweled band! 
	I beg you, say if he has crossed your land.
	
	Yes, with his thousand graces 
	streaming from him, he crossed these groves with speed, 
	and, glancing at these places--
	with no more word or deed--
	left them in his own beauty liveried.
	
	Alas, who can content me? 
	Give yourself up to me, at last, entire; 
	nor send, as you have sent me, 
	those messengers you hire 
	who cannot tell me all that I desire.
	
	And those who pass make clamor, 
	your thousand graces to my ear relaying, 
	wound me with words they stammer, 
	and kill me, ill-conveying 
	the who-knows-what that baffles all their saying.
	
	But how do you persever, 
	O life! in life not living, as you do, 
	pursued to death forever 
	by arrows that strike true, 
	aimed by that love the lover sows in you? 
	And why, having arrived 
	home to my heart, not heal it with relieving? 
	Why, since you have deprived 
	me of it, leave it grieving, 
	rather than grasp the plunder of your thieving?
	
	Extinguish all my plight, 
	since there is none but you alone to do it; 
	Be present to my sight, 
	Since you alone renew it, 
	and you alone, when seen, give value to it.
	
	Be present, drop your veil, 
	and let me die your beauty apprehending; 
	this grief that makes me pale 
	with love, can have no ending 
	without your presence, every joy transcending.
	
	O crystal fountain flowing, 
	if in your silver stream I might discern 
	them there, suddenly glowing--
	those eyes that make me burn, 
	deep in my heart inscribed--for which I yearn!
	
	Turn them, Beloved, from me, 
	or I must fly to find you! 
	
	
	_Turn, my dove, 
	love’s wound has overcome me; 
	Deer-like, I stand above, 
	cooled by the breezes stirred by wings of love._
	
	
	My lover is the highlands, 
	he is the wooded valleys lone and deep, 
	the far, mysterious islands, 
	the streams that sing and leap, 
	whispering winds that court the fields they sweep,
	
	the night whose stillness pleases 
	and ushers morning and the rising sun, 
	silence whose music eases, 
	music from silence spun, 
	and supper that delights when day is done.
	
	Hunt the quick foxes finding 
	our vineyard, where the tender shoots abound, 
	while we make garlands, binding 
	the stems of roses round, 
	and let no man be seen on the high ground.
	
	Halt, you North wind, death-maker; 
	now come, wind from the South, by love beguiled, 
	breathe on my flowered acre, 
	spreading your fragrance mild, 
	and my Lover shall graze where blooms grow wild.
	
	O, you Judean maidens! 
	Now that the rosetrees and the garden’s flowers 
	with rich perfume are laden, 
	keep to your distant bowers 
	and do not tread these thresholds that are ours.
	
	My dear one, hide, take shelter, 
	turn your face to the hills that stand in rows, 
	and speak not; see the welter 
	of maids about her where she goes, 
	wandering the strange islands no one knows.
	
	
	_Birds who fly hither lightly, 
	you lions, fawns, and leaping fallow deer, 
	woods, vales, and rivers sprightly, 
	winds, waters, heats that sear, 
	and terrors that surround the night with fear:
	
	By lyres and their soft sighing 
	I do beseech you, by the sirens’ song: 
	silence your angry crying, 
	halt where the walls rise strong, 
	to keep the sleeping bride secure from wrong.
	
	The bride has come to rest in 
	the pleasant garden’s most alluring space, 
	and at her ease to nest in 
	her quiet leaning place, 
	within the sweetness of the groom’s embrace.
	
	Under the apple boughs, 
	there did I take you when our troth was plighted, 
	there gave my hand and vows, 
	and there you were requited, 
	where once your mother was abased and slighted._
	
	
	Our marriage-couch, made festive 
	with flowers, with lion’s grottoes posted round, 
	all purple-hung, suggestive 
	of peace within it bound, 
	and with a thousand golden emblems crowned.
	
	There where your steps precede them, 
	the maidens follow in an eager line 
	where torches lead them, 
	and the spiced wine, 
	and the balsamic scent of the divine.
	
	In my Beloved’s cellar 
	I drank, and after tasting from his store, 
	wandered those fields, a dweller 
	in bliss, and cared no more 
	for the lost flocks that were my care before.
	
	There at his breast he fed me, 
	there taught me knowledge sweet, with pleasure rife; 
	there where he led me 
	I gave myself for life 
	entirely, and pledged to be his wife.
	
	My soul, in his employment, 
	spends all its wealth, forsakes its own affairs; 
	no flocks provide enjoyment, 
	no task, but that which bears 
	on love alone, and on no other cares.
	
	If, where the flocks are feeding, 
	from this day forth I am no longer found, 
	say Love is leading 
	me a dizzy round, 
	and I have let myself be lost--and bound.
	
	We shall weave emeralds, flowers 
	picked when the earliest rays of morning shine, 
	garlands grown by the powers 
	of your own love, to twine 
	about a single strand, a hair of mine.
	
	One hair you chanced to note, 
	about my neck, that did your glance awaken. 
	You glimpsed it at my throat, 
	were snared and shaken, 
	and wounded by my eye and wholly taken.
	
	Whenever you beheld me, 
	your eyes imprinted all their graces there, 
	mastered and quelled me; 
	and my eyes earned their share: 
	to worship all in you that sight laid bare.
	
	Do not, I beg, despise 
	the swarthy skin in which your sight first knew me; 
	look on me now: your eyes 
	have scattered through me 
	the beauty of the gaze with which you drew me.
	
	
	_That snowy little dove 
	bearing the branch back to the ark is flying--
	the turtle, high above--
	happily spying 
	on the green banks the Love for which she’s sighing.
	
	She once lived lonely, 
	and now, alone, has settled in her nest, 
	guided alone and only 
	by One she loves the best, 
	who, wounded for love’s sake, has come to rest._
	
	
	Let us find joy together, 
	Beloved, in your beauty find our looks 
	reflected, whether 
	on hills or in pure brooks; 
	let us go deep into those wooded nooks.
	
	Then to high, hidden 
	crevices in stony desert waste--
	caves none can find unbidden--
	we’ll go, untraced, 
	where pomegranate wine is ours to taste.
	
	You would delight me, showing 
	me, there, those things my spirit yearns to know, 
	and later by bestowing, 
	O Love I treasure so! 
	what first you gave to me some days ago.
	
	Air, in its even breathing; 
	the song sweet Philomel sings in her flight; 
	the grove, its peace bequeathing 
	to gentle night, 
	with flames consuming all in painless light.
	
	And none to apprehend it; 
	Aminadab quite gone, without a trace; 
	the siege quietly ended, 
	horsemen halting their race, 
	dismounting near the waters of that place.
