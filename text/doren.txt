*** Mark Van Doren (1894 - 1972)


1. AFTER LONG DROUGHT

	After long drought, commotion in the sky;
	After dead silence, thunder. Then it comes,
	The rain. It slashes leaves, and doubly drums
	On tin and shingle; beats and bends awry
	The flower heads; puddles dust, and with a sigh
	Like love sinks into grasses, where it hums
	As bees did once, among chrysanthemums
	And asters when the summer thought to die.
	
	The whole world dreamed of this, and has it now.
	Nor was the waking easy. The dull root
	Is jealous of its death; the sleepy brow
	Smiles in its slumber; and a heart can fear
	The very flood it longed for, roaring near.
	The spirit best remembers being mute.


2. FAREWELL AND THANKSGIVING

	Whatever I have left unsaid
	When I am dead
	O’muse forgive me.
	You were always there,
	like light, like air.
	Those great good things
	of which the least bird sings,
	So why not I?
	Yet thank you even then,
	Sweet muse, Amen.


3. HE LOVES ME

	That God should love me is more wonderful
	Than that I so imperfectly love him.
	My reason is mortality, and dim
	Senses; his--oh, insupportable--
	Is that he sees me. Even when I pull
	Dark thoughts about my head, each vein and limb
	Delights him, though remembrance in him, grim
	With my worst crimes, should prove me horrible.
	
	And he has terrors that he can release.
	But when he looks he loves me; which is why
	I wonder; and my wonder must increase
	Till more of it shall slay me. Yet I live,
	I live; and he has never ceased to give
	This glance at me that sweetens the whole sky.


4. MORNING WORSHIP

	I wake and hearing it raining.
	Were I dead, what would I give
	Lazily to lie here,
	Like this, and live?
	
	Or better yet: birdsong,
	Brightening and spreading --
	How far would I come then
	To be at the world’s wedding?
	
	Now that I lie, though,
	Listening, living,
	(Oh, but not forever,
	Oh, end arriving)
	
	How shall I praise them:
	All the sweet beings
	Eternally that outlive
	Me and my dying?
	
	Mountains, I mean; wind, water, air;
	Grass, and huge trees; clouds, flowers,
	And thunder, and night.
	
	Turtles, I mean, and toads; hawks, herons, owls;
	Graveyards, and towns, and trout; roads, gardens,
	Red berries, and deer.
	
	Lightning, I mean, and eagles; fences; snow;
	Sunrise, and ferns; waterfalls, serpents,
	Green islands, and sleep.
	
	Horses, I mean; butterflies, whales;
	Mosses, and stars and gravelly
	Rivers, and fruit.
	
	Oceans, I mean; black valleys; corn;
	Brambles, and cliffs; rock, dirt, dust, ice;
	And warnings of flood.
	
	How shall I name them?
	And in what order?
	Each would be first.
	Omission is murder.
	
	Maidens, I mean, and apples; needles; leaves;
	Worms, and planers, and clover; whirlwinds; dew;
	Bulls; geese --
	
	Stop. Lie still.
	You will never be done.
	Leave them all there.
	Old lover. Live on.


5. SPRING THUNDER

	Listen, The wind is still,
	And far away in the night--
	See! The uplands fill
	With a running light.
	
	Open the doors. It is warm;
	And where the sky was clear--
	Look! The head of a storm
	That marches here!
	
	Come under the trembling hedge--
	Fast, although you fumble . . .
	There! Did you hear the edge
	of winter crumble
