*** Ivan Bunin (1870 - 1953)


1. A FAREWELL

	Blasting the malachites beneath the rudder, 
	The seething sea spews pearly blobs of foam. 
	The shore sails nearer as we move from under 
	The ship’s smooth, towering shape and make for home. 
	
	The pier is empty. Pigeons coo and chatter 
	And peck at corn and scraps of food . . . At sea, 
	The ship’s stern sways, the bowsprit draws a pattern 
	Upon the dimming sky’s dark canopy. 
	
	Where now? March. Dusk. In port, the church bells ringing. 
	Of spring and sadness full this soul of mine. 
	Lights at the inn . . . No, home I’ll go, I’m thinking! 
	For I am drunk--drunk though I’ve touched no wine.


2. LONELINESS

	The rain and the wind and the murk 
	Reign over cold desert of fall, 
	Here, life’s interrupted till spring; 
	Till the spring, gardens barren and tall. 
	I’m alone in my house, it’s dim 
	At the easel, and drafts through the rims. 
	
	The other day, you came to me, 
	But I feel you are bored with me now. 
	The somber day’s over, it seemed 
	You were there for me as my spouse. 
	Well, so long, I will somehow strive 
	To survive till the spring with no wife. 
	
	The clouds, again, have today 
	Returned, passing, patch after patch. 
	Your footprints got smudged by the rain, 
	And are filling with water by the porch. 
	As I sink into lonesome despair 
	From the vanishing late autumn’s glare. 
	
	I gasped to call after you fast: 
	Please come back, you’re a part of me, dear; 
	To a woman, there is no past 
	Once love ends, you’re a stranger to her; 
	I’ll get drunk, I will watch burning logs, 
	Would be splendid to get me a dog.
