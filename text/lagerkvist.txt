*** PÃ¤r Lagerkvist (1891 - 1974)


1. ANGUISH

	Anguish, anguish is my heritage,
	the wound of my throat,
	the cry of my heart in the world.
	Now the lathered sky congeals
	in the coarse hand of night;
	now the forests
	and the rigid heights
	rise barrenly against
	the dwarfed vault of the sky.
	How hard everything is,
	how stiffened, black and silent!
	
	I grope about this darkened room,
	I feel the sharp edge of the cliff against my finger.
	I tear my sore and aching hands
	on the hills and darkened woods,
	on the black iron of sky
	and on the cold earth!
	
	Anguish, anguish is my heritage,
	the wound of my throat,
	the cry of my heart in the world.


2. I WANTED TO KNOW

	I wanted to know
	but was only allowed to ask,
	I wanted light
	but was only allowed to burn.
	I demanded the ineffable
	but was only allowed to live.
	
	I complained,
	but nobody understood what I meant.
