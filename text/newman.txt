*** John Henry Newman (1801 - 1890)


1. LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT

	Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,
	Lead thou me on!
	The night is dark, and I am far from home,--
	Lead thou me on!
	Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see
	The distant scene,--one step enough for me.

	I was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou
	Shouldst lead me on:
	I loved to choose and see my path, but now
	Lead thou me on!
	I loved the garish days, and, spite of fears,
	Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.

	So long thy power hath blessed me, sure it still
	Will lead me on;
	O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till
	The night is gone;
	And with the morn those angel faces smile
	Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.



2. THE TRANCE OF TIME

	_Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,
	Atque metus omnes, et inexorabile fatum
	Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari!_


	IN childhood, when with eager eyes
	The season-measured year I view’d,
	All garb’d in fairy guise,
	Pledged constancy of good.

	Spring sang of heaven; the summer flowers
	Bade me gaze on, and did not fade;
	Even suns o’er autumn’s bowers
	Heard my strong wish, and stay’d.

	They came and went, the short-lived four;
	Yet, as their varying dance they wove,
	To my young heart each bore
	Its own sure claim of love.

	Far different now;--the whirling year
	Vainly my dizzy eyes pursue;
	And its fair tints appear
	All blent in one dusk hue.

	Why dwell on rich autumnal lights,
	Spring-time, or winter’s social ring?
	Long days are fire-side nights,
	Brown autumn is fresh spring.

	Then what this world to thee, my heart?
	Its gifts nor feed thee nor can bless.
	Thou hast no owner’s part
	In all its fleetingness.

	The flame, the storm, the quaking ground,
	Earth’s joy, earth’s terror, nought is thine,
	Thou must but hear the sound
	Of the still voice divine.

	O priceless art! O princely state!
	E’en while by sense of change opprest,
	Within to antedate
	Heaven’s Age of fearless rest.
