1. THE APPALACHIAN BOOK OF THE DEAD

	Sunday, September Sunday . . . Outdoors,
	Like an early page from The Appalachian Book of the Dead,   
	Sunlight lavishes brilliance on every surface,
	Doves settle, surreptitious angels, on tree limb and box branch,   
	A crow calls, deep in its own darkness,
	Something like water ticks on
	Just there, beyond the horizon, just there, steady clock . . .
	
	Go in fear of abstractions . . .
	            Well, possibly. Meanwhile,
	They are the strata our bodies rise through, the sere veins   
	Our skins rub off on.
	For instance, whatever enlightenment there might be   
	Housels compassion and affection, those two tributaries   
	That river above our lives,
	Whose waters we sense the sense of
	            late at night, and later still.
	
	Uneasy, suburbanized,
	I drift from the lawn chair to the back porch to the dwarf orchard   
	Testing the grass and border garden.
	A stillness, as in the passageways of Paradise,
	Bell jars the afternoon.
	            Leaves, like ex votos, hang hard and shine   
	Under the endlessness of heaven.
	Such skeletal altars, such vacant sanctuary.
	
	It always amazes me
	How landscape recalibrates the stations of the dead,
	How what we see jacks up
	                                                 the odd quotient of what we don’t see,   
	How God’s breath reconstitutes our walking up and walking down.   
	First glimpse of autumn, stretched tight and snicked, a bad face lift,
	Flicks in and flicks out,
	            a virtual reality.
	Time to begin the long division.



2. BLACK ZODIAC

	Darkened by time, the masters, like our memories, mix 
	And mismatch, 
	and settle about our lawn furniture, like air 
	Without a meaning, like air in its clear nothingness. 
	What can we say to either of them? 
	How can they be so dark and so clear at the same time? 
	They ruffle our hair, 
	they ruffle the leaves of the August trees. 
	Then stop, abruptly as wind. 
	The flies come back, and the heat-- 
	what can we say to them? 
	Nothing is endless but the sky. 
	The flies come back, and the afternoon 
	Teeters a bit on its green edges, 
	then settles like dead weight 
	Next to our memories, and the pale hems of the masters’ gowns. 
	________ 
	
	Those who look for the Lord will cry out in praise of him. 
	Perhaps. And perhaps not-- 
	dust and ashes though we are, 
	Some will go wordlessly, some 
	Will listen their way in with their mouths 
	Where pain puts them, an inch-and-a-half above the floor. 
	And some will revile him out of love 
	and deep disdain. 
	The gates of mercy, like an eclipse, darken our undersides. 
	Rows of gravestones stay our steps, 
	August humidity 
	Bright as auras around our bodies. 
	And some will utter the words, 
	speaking in fear and tongues, 
	Hating their garments splotched by the flesh. 
	These are the lucky ones, the shelved ones, the twice-erased. 
	________ 
	
	Dante and John Chrysostom 
	Might find this afternoon a sidereal roadmap, 
	A pilgrim’s way . . .
	You might too 
	Under the prejaundiced outline of the quarter moon, 
	Clouds sculling downsky like a narrative for whatever comes, 
	What hasn’t happened to happen yet 
	Still lurking behind the stars, 
	31 August 1995 . . .
	The afterlife of insects, space graffiti, white holes 
	In the landscape, 
	such things, such avenues, lead to dust 
	And handle our hurt with ease. 
	Sky blue, blue of infinity, blue 
	waters above the earth: 
	Why do the great stories always exist in the past? 
	________ 
	
	The unexamined life’s no different from 
	the examined life-- 
	Unanswerable questions, small talk, 
	Unprovable theorems, long-abandoned arguments-- 
	You’ve got to write it all down. 
	Landscape or waterscape, light-length on evergreen, dark sidebar 
	Of evening, 
	you’ve got to write it down. 
	Memory’s handkerchief, death’s dream and automobile, 
	God’s sleep, 
	you’ve still got to write it down, 
	Moon half-empty, moon half-full, 
	Night starless and egoless, night blood-black and prayer-black, 
	Spider at work between the hedges, 
	Last bird call, 
	toad in a damp place, tree frog in a dry . . .
	________ 
	
	We go to our graves with secondary affections, 
	Second-hand satisfaction, half-souled, 
	star charts demagnetized. 
	We go in our best suits. The birds are flying. Clouds pass. 
	Sure we’re cold and untouchable, 
	but we harbor no ill will. 
	No tooth tuned to resentment’s fork, 
	we’re out of here, and sweet meat. 
	Calligraphers of the disembodied, God’s word-wards, 
	What letters will we illuminate? 
	Above us, the atmosphere, 
	The nothing that’s nowhere, signs on, and waits for our beck and call. 
	Above us, the great constellations sidle and wince, 
	The letters undarken and come forth, 
	Your X and my X. 
	The letters undarken and they come forth. 
	________ 
	
	Eluders of memory, nocturnal sleep of the greenhouse, 
	Spirit of slides and silences, 
	Invisible Hand, 
	Witness and walk on. 
	Lords of the discontinuous, lords of the little gestures, 
	Succor my shift and save me . . .
	All afternoon the rain has rained down in the mind, 
	And in the gardens and dwarf orchard. 
	All afternoon 
	The lexicon of late summer has turned its pages 
	Under the rain, 
	abstracting the necessary word. 
	Autumn’s upon us. 
	The rain fills our narrow beds. 
	Description’s an element, like air or water. 
	That’s the word.



3. CLEAR NIGHT

	Clear night, thumb-top of a moon, a back-lit sky.
	Moon-fingers lay down their same routine
	On the side deck and the threshold, the white keys and the black keys.
	Bird hush and bird song. A cassia flower falls.
	
	I want to be bruised by God.
	I want to be strung up in a strong light and singled out.
	I want to be stretched, like music wrung from a dropped seed.   
	I want to be entered and picked clean.
	
	And the wind says “What?” to me.
	And the castor beans, with their little earrings of death, say “What?” to me.
	And the stars start out on their cold slide through the dark.   
	And the gears notch and the engines wheel.



4. FUTURE TENSE

	All things in the end are bittersweet--
	An empty gaze, a little way-station just beyond silence.
	
	If you can’t delight in the everyday,
	                     you have no future here.
	
	And if you can, no future either.
	
	And time, black dog, will sniff you out, 
	                    and lick your lean cheeks,
	And lie down beside you--warm, real close--and will not move.



5. ROAD WARRIORS

	My traveling clothes light up the noon. 
	I’ve been on my way for a long time 
	back to the past, 
	That irreconcilable city. 
	Everyone wants to join me, it seems, and I let them. 
	Roadside flowers drive me to distraction, 
	dragonflies 
	Hover like lapus lazuli, there, just out of reach. 
	
	Narrow road, wide road, all of us on it, unhappy, 
	Unsettled, seven yards short of immortality 
	And a yard short of not long to live. 
	Better to sit down in the tall grass 
	and watch the clouds, 
	To lift our faces up to the sky, 
	Considering--for most of us--our lives have been a constant mistake.
