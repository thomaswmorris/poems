*** George MacDonald (1824 - 1905)


1. THE DEATH OF THE OLD YEAR

	The weary Old Year is dead at last;
	His corpse ‘mid the ruins of Time is cast
	Where the mouldering wrecks of lost Thought lie
	And the rich-hued blossoms of Passion die
	To a withering grass that droops o’er his grave
	The shadowy Titan’s refuge cave.
	Strange lights from pale moony Memory lie
	On the weedy columns beneath its eye;
	And strange is the sound of the ghostlike breeze
	In the lingering leaves on the skeleton trees;
	And strange is the sound of the falling shower
	When the clouds of dead pain o’er the spirit lower;
	Unheard in the home he inhabiteth
	The land where all lost things are gathered by Death.
	
	Alone I reclined in the closing year;
	Voice nor breathing nor step was near;
	And I said in the weariness of my breast:
	Weary Old Year thou art going to rest;
	O weary Old Year I would I might be
	One hour alone in thy dying with thee!
	Would thou wert a spirit whose low lament
	Might mix with the sighs from my spirit sent;
	For I am weary of man and life;
	Weary of restless unchanging strife;
	Weary of change that is ever changing;
	Weary of thought that is ever ranging
	Ever falling in efforts vain
	Fluttering upspringing from earth again
	Struggling once more through the darkness to wing
	That hangs o’er the birthplace of everything
	And choked yet again in the vapour’s breast
	Sinking once more to a helpless rest.
	I am weary of tears that scarce are dry
	Ere their founts are filled as the cloud goes by;
	Weary of feelings where each in the throng
	Mocks at the rest as they crowd along;
	Where Pride over all like a god on high
	Sits enshrined in his self-complacency;
	Where Selfishness crawls the snake-demon of ill
	The least suspected where busiest still;
	Where all things evil and painful entwine
	And all in their hate and their sorrow are mine:
	O weary Old Year I would I might be
	One hour by thy dying to weep with thee!
	
	Peace the soul’s slumber was round me shed;
	The sleep where thought lives but its pain is dead;
	And my musings led me a spirit-band
	Through the wide realms of their native land;
	Till I stood by the couch of the mighty dying
	A lonely shore in the midnight lying.
	He lay as if he had laid him to sleep
	And the stars above him their watch did keep;
	And the mournful wind with the dreamy sigh
	The homeless wanderer of the sky
	Was the only attendant whose gentle breath
	Soothed him yet on the couch of death;
	And the dying waves of the heedless sea
	Fell at his feet most listlessly.
	
	But he lay in peace with his solemn eye
	Looking far through the mists of futurity.
	A smile gleamed over the death-dew that lay
	On his withered cheek as life ebbed away.
	A darkness lay on his forehead vast;
	But the light of expectancy o’er it was cast--
	A light that shone from the coming day
	Travelling unseen to the East away.
	In his cloudy robes that lay shadowing wide
	I stretched myself motionless by his side;
	And his eyes with their calm unimpassioned power
	Soothing my heart like an evening shower
	Led in a spectral far-billowing train
	The hours of the Past through my spirit again.
	
	There were fears of evil whose stony eyes
	Froze joy in its gushing melodies.
	Some floated afar on thy tranquil wave
	And the heart looked up from its search for a grave;
	While others as guests to the bosom came
	And left its wild children more sorrow less shame;
	For the death-look parts from their chilling brow
	And they bless the heads that before them bow;
	And floating away in the far-off gloom.
	Thankfulness follows them to their tomb.
	There were Hopes that found not a place to rest
	Their foot ‘mid the rush of all-ocean’s breast;
	And home to the sickening heart flew back
	But changed into sorrows upon their track;
	And through the moan of the darkening sea
	Bearing no leaf from the olive-tree.
	There were joys that looked forth with their maiden eyes
	And smiled and were gone with a sad surprise;
	And the Love of the Earthly whose beauteous form
	Beckoned me on through sunshine and storm;
	But when the bounding heart sprang high
	Meeting her smile with a speechless sigh
	The arms sunk home with a painful start
	Clasping a vacancy to the heart.
	
	And the voice of the dying I seem to hear
	But whether his breathing is in mine ear
	Or the sounds of the breaking billows roll
	The lingering accents upon my soul
	I know not; but thus they seem to bear
	Reproof to my soul for its faint despair:--
	Blame not life it is scarce begun;
	Blame not mankind thyself art one.
	And change is holy oh! blame it never;
	Thy soul shall live by its changing ever;
	Not the bubbling change of a stagnant pool
	But the change of a river flowing and full;
	Where all that is noble and good will grow
	Mightier still as the full tides flow;
	Till it joins the hidden the boundless sea
	Rolling through depths of Eternity.
	Blame not thy thought that it cannot reach
	That which the Infinite must teach;
	Bless thy God that the Word came nigh
	To guide thee home to thy native sky
	Where all things are homely and glorious too
	And the children are wondering and glad and true.
	
	And he pointed away to an Eastern star
	That gleamed through his robes o’er the ocean afar;
	And I knew that a star had looked o’er the rim
	Of my world that lay all dreary and dim;
	And was slowly dissolving the darkness deep
	Which like evil nurse had soothed me to sleep;
	And rising higher and shining clearer
	Would draw the day-spring ever nearer
	Till the sunshine of God burst full on the morn
	And every hill and valley would start
	With the joy of light and new gratitude born
	To Him who had led me home to His heart;
	And all things that lived in my world within
	With the gladness of tears to His feet come in;
	And the false Self be banished with fiends to dwell
	In the gloomiest haunts of his native hell;
	And Pride that ruled like a god above
	Be trod ‘neath the feet of triumphant Love.
	
	And again he pointed across the sea
	And another vision arose in me:
	And I knew I walked an ocean of fear
	Yet of safety too for the Master was near;
	And every wave of sorrow or dread
	O’er which strong faith should upraise my head
	Would show from the height of its troubled crest
	Still nearer and nearer the Land of Rest.
	And when the storm-spray on the wind should arise
	And with tears unbidden should blind mine eyes
	And hide from my vision the Home of Love
	I knew I must look to the star above
	And the mists of Passion would quickly flee
	And the storm would faint to serenity.
	
	And again it seemed as if words found scope
	The sorrowing words of a farewell Hope:
	“I will meet thee again in that deathless land
	Whenever thy foot shall imprint the strand;
	And the loveliest things that have here been mine
	Shall there in eternal beauty shine;
	For there I shall live and never die
	Part of a glorious Eternity;
	For the death of Time is _To be forgot_
	And I go where oblivion entereth not.”
	
	He was dead. He had gone to the rest of his race
	With a sad smile frozen upon his face.
	Deadness clouded his eyes. And his death-bell rung
	And my sorrowing thoughts his low requiem sung;
	And with trembling steps his worn body cast
	In the wide charnel-house of the dreary Past.
	Thus met the noble Old Year his end:
	Rest him in peace for he was my friend.
	
	As my thoughts returned from their wandering
	A voice in my spirit was lingering;
	And its sounds were like Spring’s first breeze’s hum
	When the oak-leaves fall and the young leaves come:
	
	Time dieth ever is ever born:
	On the footsteps of night so treadeth the morn;
	Shadow and brightness death and birth
	Chasing each other o’er the round earth.
	But the spirit of Time from his tomb is springing
	The dust of decay from his pinions flinging;
	Ever renewing his glorious youth
	Scattering around him the dew of Truth.
	Oh let it raise in the desert heart
	Fountains and flowers that shall never depart!
	This spirit will fill us with thought sublime;
	For the _End of God_ is the spirit of Time.


2. THE HILLS

	Behind my father’s house there lies
	 A little grassy brae
	Whose face my childhood’s busy feet
	 Ran often up in play
	Whence on the chimneys I looked down
	 In wonderment alway.
	
	Around the house where’er I turned
	 Great hills closed up the view;
	The town ‘midst their converging roots
	 Was clasped by rivers two;
	From one hill to another sprang
	 The sky’s great arch of blue.
	
	Oh! how I loved to climb their sides
	 And in the heather lie;
	The bridle on my arm did hold
	 The pony feeding by;
	Beneath the silvery streams; above
	 The white clouds in the sky.
	
	And now in wandering about
	 Whene’er I see a hill
	A childish feeling of delight
	 Springs in my bosom still;
	And longings for the high unknown
	 Follow and flow and fill.
	
	For I am always climbing hills
	 And ever passing on
	Hoping on some high mountain peak
	 To find my Father’s throne;
	For hitherto I’ve only found
	 His footsteps in the stone.
	
	And in my wanderings I have met
	 A spirit child like me
	Who laid a trusting hand in mine
	 So fearlessly and free
	That so together we have gone
	 Climbing continually.
	
	Upfolded in a spirit bud
	 The child appeared in space
	Not born amid the silent hills
	 But in a busy place;
	And yet in every hill we see
	 A strange familiar face.
	
	For they are near our common home;
	 And so in trust we go
	Climbing and climbing on and on
	 Whither we do not know;
	Not waiting for the mournful dark
	 But for the dawning slow.
	
	Clasp my hand closer yet my child--
	 A long way we have come!
	Clasp my hand closer yet my child--
	 For we have far to roam
	Climbing and climbing till we reach
	 Our Heavenly Father’s home.


3. HOPE DEFERRED

	Summer is come again. The sun is bright
	And the soft wind is breathing. We will joy;
	And seeing in each other’s eyes the light
	Of the same joy smile hopeful. Our employ
	Shall like the birds’ be airy castles things
	Built by gay hopes and fond imaginings
	Peopling the land within us. We will tell
	Of the green hills and of the silent sea
	And of all summer things that calmly dwell
	A waiting Paradise for you and me.
	And if our thoughts should wander upon sorrow
	Yet hope will wait upon the far-off morrow.
	
	Look on those leaves. It was not Summer’s mouth
	That breathed that hue upon them. And look there--
	On that thin tree. See through its branches bare
	How low the sun is in the mid-day South!
	This day is but a gleam of gladness flown
	Back from the past to tell us what is gone.
	For the dead leaves are falling; and our heart
	Which with the world is ever changing so
	Gives back in echoes sad and low
	The rustling sigh wherewith dead leaves depart:
	A sound not murmuring but faint and wild;
	A sorrow for the Past that hath no child--
	No sweet-voiced child with the bright name of Hope.
	
	We are like you poor leaves! but have more scope
	For sorrow; for our summers pass away
	With a slow year-long overshadowing decay.
	Yea Spring’s first blossom disappears
	Slain by the shadow of the coming years.
	
	Come round me my beloved. We will hold
	All of us compassed thus: a winter day
	Is drawing nigh us. We are growing old;
	And if we be not as a ring enchanted
	About each other’s heart to keep us gay
	The young who claim that joy which haunted
	Our visions once will push us far away
	Into the desolate regions dim and grey
	Where the sea hath no moaning and the cloud
	No rain of tears but apathy doth shroud
	All being and all time. But if we keep
	Together thus the tide of youth will sweep
	Round us with thousand joyous waves
	As round some palmy island of the deep;
	And our youth hover round us like the breath
	Of one that sleeps and sleepeth not to death.
	
	Thus onward hand in hand to parted graves
	The sundered doors into one palace home
	Through age’s thickets faltering we will go
	If He who leads us wills it so
	Believing in our youth and in the Past;
	Within us tending to the last
	Love’s radiant lamp which burns in cave or dome;
	And like the lamps that ages long have glowed
	In blessed graves when once the weary load
	Of tomb-built years is heaved up and cast
	For youth and immortality away
	Will flash abroad in open day
	Clear as a star in heaven’s blue-vaulted night;
	Shining till then through every wrinkled fold
	With the Transfiguration’s conquering might;
	That Youth our faces wondering shall behold
	And shall be glad not fearing to be old.


4. THE JOURNEY

	I
	
	Hark the rain is on my roof!
	Every sound drops through the dark
	On my soul with dull reproof
	Like a half-extinguished spark.
	I! alas how am I here
	In the midnight and alone?
	Caught within a net of fear!
	All my dreams of beauty gone!
	
	I will rise: I must go forth.
	Better face the hideous night
	Better dare the unseen north
	Than be still without the light!
	Black wind rushing round my brow
	Sown with stinging points of rain!
	Place or time I know not now--
	I am here and so is pain!
	
	I will leave the sleeping street
	Hie me forth on darker roads.
	Ah! I cannot stay my feet
	Onward onward something goads.
	I will take the mountain path
	Beard the storm within its den
	Know the worst of this dim wrath
	Vexing thus the souls of men.
	
	Chasm ‘neath chasm! rock piled on rock:
	Roots and crumbling earth and stones!
	Hark the torrent’s thundering shock!
	Hark the swaying pine tree’s groans!
	Ah I faint I fall I die!
	Sink to nothingness away!--
	Lo a streak upon the sky!
	Lo the opening eye of day!
	
	
	II
	
	Mountain heights that lift their snows
	O’er a valley green and low;
	And a winding path that goes
	Guided by the river’s flow;
	And a music rising ever
	As of peace and low content
	From the pebble-paven river
	As an odour upward sent.
	
	And a sighing of the storm
	Far away amid the hills
	Like the humming of a swarm
	That the summer forest fills;
	And a frequent fall of rain
	From a cloud with ragged weft;
	And a burst of wind amain
	From the mountain’s sudden cleft.
	
	Then a night that hath a moon
	Staining all the cloudy white;
	Sinking with a soundless tune
	Deep into the spirit’s night.
	Then a morning clear and soft
	Amber on the purple hills;
	Warm high day of summer oft
	Cooled by wandering windy rills.
	
	Joy to travel thus along
	With the universe around!
	I the centre of the throng;
	Every sight and every sound
	Speeding with its burden laden
	Speeding homewards to my soul!
	Mine the eye the stars are made in!
	I the heart of all this whole!
	
	
	III
	
	Hills retreat on either hand
	Sinking down into the plain;
	Slowly through the level land
	Glides the river to the main.
	What is that before me white
	Gleaming through the dusky air?
	Dimmer in the gathering night;
	Still beheld I know not where?
	
	Is it but a chalky ridge
	Bared by many a trodden mark?
	Or a river-spanning bridge
	Miles away into the dark?
	Or the foremost leaping waves
	Of the everlasting sea
	Where the Undivided laves
	Time with its eternity?
	
	No tis but an eye-made sight
	In my brain a fancied gleam;
	Or a thousand things as white
	Set in darkness well might seem.
	There it wavers shines is gone;
	What it is I cannot tell;
	When the morning star hath shone
	I shall see and know it well.
	
	Onward onward through the night!
	Matters it I cannot see?
	I am moving in a might
	Dwelling in the dark and me.
	Up or down or here or there
	I can never be alone;
	My own being tells me where
	God is as the Father known.
	
	
	IV
	
	Joy! O joy! the Eastern sea
	Answers to the Eastern sky;
	Wide and featured gloriously
	With swift billows bursting high.
	Nearer nearer oh! the sheen
	On a thousand waves at once!
	Oh! the changing crowding green!
	Oh my beating heart’s response!
	
	Down rejoicing to the strand
	Where the sea-waves shore-ward lean
	Curve their graceful heads and stand
	Gleaming with ethereal green
	Then in foam fall heavily--
	This is what I saw at night!
	Lo a boat! I’ll forth on thee
	Dancing-floor for my delight.
	
	From the bay wind-winged we glance;
	Sea-winds seize me by the hair!
	What a terrible expanse!
	How the ocean tumbles there!
	I am helpless here afloat
	For the wild waves know not me;
	Gladly would I change my boat
	For the snow wings of the sea!
	
	Look below. Each watery whirl
	Cast in beauty’s living mould!
	Look above! Each feathery curl
	Faintly tinged with morning gold!--
	Oh I tremble with the gush
	Of an everlasting youth!
	Love and fear together rush:
	I am free in God the Truth!


5. LONGING

	Away from the city’s herds!
	 Away from the noisy street!
	Away from the storm of words
	 Where hateful and hating meet!
	
	Away from the vapour grey
	 That like a boding of ill
	Is blotting the morning gay
	 And gathers and darkens still!
	
	Away from the stupid book!
	 For like the fog’s weary rest
	With anger dull it fills each nook
	 Of my aching and misty breast.
	
	Over some shining shore
	 There hangeth a space of blue;
	A parting ‘mid thin clouds hoar
	 Where the sunlight is falling through.
	
	The glad waves are kissing the shore
	 Rejoice and tell it for ever;
	The boat glides on while its oar
	 Is flashing out of the river.
	
	Oh to be there with thee!
	 Thou and I only my love!
	The sparkling sands and the sea!
	 And the sunshine of God above!


6. MARY MAGDALENE

	With eyes aglow and aimless zeal
	 Throughout the land she goes;
	Her tones her motions all reveal
	 A mind without repose.
	
	She climbs the hills she haunts the sea
	 By madness tortured driven;
	One hour’s forgetfulness would be
	 A gift from very heaven.
	
	The night brings sleep the sleep distress;
	 The torture of the day
	Returns as free in darker dress
	 In more secure dismay.
	
	No soft-caressing soothing palm
	 Her confidence can raise;
	No eye hath loving force to calm
	 And draw her answering gaze.
	
	He comes. He speaks. A light divine
	 Dawns gracious in thy soul;
	Thou seest love and order shine--
	 His health will make thee whole.
	
	One wrench of pain one pang of death
	 And in a faint delight
	Thou liest waiting for new breath
	 For morning out of night.
	
	Thou risest up: the earth is fair
	 The wind is cool and free;
	As when a dream of mad despair
	 Dissolves in ecstasy.
	
	And pledge of life and future high
	 Thou seest the Master stand;
	The life of love is in his eye
	 Its power is in his hand.
	
	What matter that the coming time
	 Will stain thy virgin name;
	Attribute thy distress to crime
	 The worst for woman-fame;
	
	Yea call that woman Magdalen
	 Whom slow-reviving grace
	Turneth at last from evil men
	 To seek the Father’s face.
	
	What matters it? The night is gone;
	 Right joyous shines the sun;
	The same clear sun that always shone
	 Ere sorrow had begun.
	
	Oh! any name may come and bide
	If he be well content
	To see not seldom by his side
	 Thy head serenely bent.
	
	Thou sharing in the awful doom
	 Wilt help thy Lord to die;
	And mourning o’er his empty tomb
	 First share his victory.


7. MY HEART

	I heard in darkness on my bed
	 The beating of my heart
	To servant feet and regnant head
	 A common life impart
	By the liquid cords in every thread
	 Unbroken as they start.
	
	Night with its power to silence day
	 Filled up my lonely room;
	All motion quenching save what lay
	 Beyond its passing doom
	Where in his shed the workman gay
	 Went on despite the gloom.
	
	I listened and I knew the sound
	 And the trade that he was plying;
	For backwards forwards bound and bound
	 ‘Twas a shuttle flying flying;
	Weaving ever life’s garment round
	 Till the weft go out with sighing.
	
	I said O mystic thing thou goest
	 On working in the dark;
	In space’s shoreless sea thou rowest
	 Concealed within thy bark;
	All wondrous things thou wonder showest
	 Yet dost not any mark.
	
	For all the world is woven by thee
	 Besides this fleshly dress;
	With earth and sky thou clothest me
	 Form distance loftiness;
	A globe of glory spouting free
	 Around the visionless.
	
	For when thy busy efforts fail
	 And thy shuttle moveless lies
	They will fall from me like a veil
	 From before a lady’s eyes;
	As a night-perused just-finished tale
	 In the new daylight dies.
	
	But not alone dost thou unroll
	 The mountains fields and seas
	A mighty wonder-painted scroll
	 Like the Patmos mysteries;
	Thou mediator ‘twixt my soul
	 And higher things than these.
	
	In holy ephod clothing me
	 Thou makest me a seer;
	In all the lovely things I see
	 The inner truths appear;
	And the deaf spirit without thee
	 No spirit-word could hear.
	
	Yet though so high thy mission is
	 And thought to spirit brings
	Thy web is but the chrysalis
	 Where lie the future wings
	Now growing into perfectness
	 By thy inwoven things.
	
	Then thou God’s pulse wilt cease to beat;
	 But His heart will still beat on
	Weaving another garment meet
	 If needful for his son;
	And sights more glorious to complete
	 The web thou hast begun.


8. OH THOU OF LITTLE FAITH!

	Sad-hearted be at peace: the snowdrop lies
	 Under the cold sad earth-clods and the snow;
	But spring is floating up the southern skies
	 And the pale snowdrop silent waits below.
	
	O loved if known! in dull December’s day
	 One scarce believes there is a month of June;
	But up the stairs of April and of May
	 The dear sun climbeth to the summer’s noon.
	
	Dear mourner! I love God and so I rest;
	 O better! God loves thee and so rest thou:
	He is our spring-time our dim-visioned Best
	 And He will help thee--do not fear the _How._


9. A PRAYER FOR THE PAST

	 All sights and sounds of every year
	All groups and forms each leaf and gem
	Are thine O God nor need I fear
	To speak to Thee of them.
	
	 Too great thy heart is to despise;
	Thy day girds centuries about;
	From things which we count small thine eyes
	See great things looking out.
	
	 Therefore this prayerful song I sing
	May come to Thee in ordered words;
	Therefore its sweet sounds need not cling
	In terror to their chords.
	
	      *       *       *       *       *
	
	 I know that nothing made is lost;
	That not a moon hath ever shone
	That not a cloud my eyes hath crost
	But to my soul hath gone.
	
	 That all the dead years garnered lie
	In this gem-casket my dim soul;
	And that thy hand may once apply
	The key that opes the whole.
	
	 But what lies dead in me yet lives
	In Thee whose Parable is--Time
	And Worlds and Forms and Sound that gives
	Words and the music-chime.
	
	 And after my next coming birth
	The new child’s prayer will rise to Thee:
	To hear again the sounds of Earth
	Its sights again to see.
	
	 With child’s glad eyes to see once more
	The visioned glories of the gloom
	With climbing suns and starry store
	Ceiling my little room.
	
	 O call again the moons that glide
	Behind old vapours sailing slow;
	Lost sights of solemn skies that slide
	O’er eyelids sunken low.
	
	 Show me the tides of dawning swell
	And lift the world’s dim eastern eye
	And the dark tears that all night fell
	With radiance glorify.
	
	 First I would see oh sore bereft!
	My father’s house my childhood’s home;
	Where the wild snow-storms raved and left
	White mounds of frozen foam.
	
	 Till going out one dewy morn
	A man was turning up the mould;
	And in our hearts the spring was born
	Crept hither through the cold.
	
	 And with the glad year I would go
	The troops of daisies round my feet;
	Flying the kite or in the glow
	Of arching summer heat
	
	 Outstretched in fear upon the bank
	Lest gazing up on awful space
	I should fall down into the blank
	From off the round world’s face.
	
	 And let my brothers be with me
	To play our old games yet again;
	And all should go as lovingly
	As now that we are men.
	
	 If over Earth the shade of Death
	Passed like a cloud’s wide noiseless wing
	We’d tell a secret in low breath:
	“Mind ‘tis a _dream_ of Spring.
	
	 “And in this dream our brother’s gone
	Upstairs; he heard our father call;
	For one by one we go alone
	Till he has gathered all.”
	
	 Father in joy our knees we bow;
	This earth is not a place of tombs:
	We are but in the nursery now;
	They in the upper rooms.
	
	 For are we not at home in Thee
	And all this world a visioned show;
	That knowing what _Abroad_ is we
	What _Home_ is too may know?
	
	 And at thy feet I sit O Lord
	As years ago in moonlight pale
	I sat and heard my father’s word
	Reading a lofty tale.
	
	 So in this vision I would go
	Still onward through the gliding years
	Reaping great Noontide’s joyous glow
	Still Eve’s refreshing tears.
	
	 One afternoon sit pondering
	In that old chair in that old room
	Where passing pigeon’s sudden wing
	Flashed lightning through the gloom.
	
	 There try once more with effort vain
	To mould in one perplexed things;
	And find the solace yet again
	Faith in the Father brings.
	
	 Or on my horse go wandering round
	Mid desert moors and mountains high;
	While storm-clouds darkly brooding found
	In me another sky.
	
	 For so thy Visible grew mine
	Though half its power I could not know;
	And in me wrought a work divine
	Which Thou hadst ordered so;
	
	 Filling my brain with form and word
	From thy full utterance unto men;
	Shapes that might ancient Truth afford
	And find it words again.
	
	 Till Spring in after years of youth
	Wove its dear form with every form;
	Now a glad bursting into Truth
	Now a low sighing storm.
	
	 But in this vision of the Past
	Spring-world to summer leading in
	Whose joys but not whose sorrows last
	I have left out the sin.
	
	 I picture but development
	Green leaves unfolding to their fruits
	Expanding flowers aspiring scent
	But not the writhing roots.
	
	 Then follow English sunsets o’er
	A warm rich land outspread below;
	A green sea from a level shore
	Bright boats that come and go.
	
	 And one beside me in whose eyes
	Old Nature found a welcome home
	A treasury of changeful skies
	Beneath a changeless dome.
	
	 But will it still be thus O God?
	And shall I always wish to see
	And trace again the hilly road
	By which I went to Thee?
	
	 We bend above a joy new given
	That gives new feelings gladsome birth;
	A living gift from one in heaven
	To two upon the earth.
	
	 Are no days creeping softly on
	Which I should tremble to renew?
	I thank thee Lord for what is gone--
	Thine is the future too.
	
	 And are we not at home in Thee
	And all this world a visioned show;
	That knowing what _Abroad_ is we
	What _Home_ is too may know?


10. REST

	I
	
	When round the earth the Father’s hands
	 Have gently drawn the dark;
	Sent off the sun to fresher lands
	 And curtained in the lark;
	‘Tis sweet all tired with glowing day
	 To fade with faded light;
	To lie once more the old weary way
	 Upfolded in the night.
	
	A mother o’er the couch may bend
	 And rose-leaf kisses heap:
	In soothing dreams with sleep they blend
	 Till even in dreams we sleep.
	And if we wake while night is dumb
	 ‘Tis sweet to turn and say
	It is an hour ere dawning come
	 And I will sleep till day.
	
	
	II
	
	There is a dearer warmer bed
	 Where one all day may lie
	Earth’s bosom pillowing the head
	 And let the world go by.
	Instead of mother’s love-lit eyes
	 The church’s storied pane
	All blank beneath cold starry skies
	 Or sounding in the rain.
	
	The great world shouting forward fares:
	 This chamber hid from none
	Hides safe from all for no one cares
	 For those whose work is done.
	Cheer thee my heart though tired and slow
	 An unknown grassy place
	Somewhere on earth is waiting now
	 To rest thee from thy race.
	
	
	III
	
	There is a calmer than all calms
	 A quiet more deep than death:
	A folding in the Father’s palms
	 A breathing in his breath;
	A rest made deeper by alarms
	 And stormy sounds combined:
	The child within its mother’s arms
	 Sleeps sounder for the wind.
	
	There needs no curtained bed to hide
	 The world with all its wars
	Nor grassy cover to divide
	 From sun and moon and stars
	A window open to the skies
	 A sense of changeless life
	With oft returning still surprise
	 Repels the sounds of strife.
	
	
	IV
	
	As one bestrides a wild scared horse
	 Beneath a stormy moon
	And still his heart with quiet force
	 Beats on its own calm tune;
	So if my heart with trouble now
	 Be throbbing in my breast
	Thou art my deeper heart and Thou
	 O God dost ever rest.
	
	When mighty sea-winds madly blow
	 And tear the scattered waves;
	As still as summer woods below
	 Lie darkling ocean caves:
	The wind of words may toss my heart
	 But what is that to me!
	‘Tis but a surface storm--Thou art
	 My deep still resting sea.


11. A THANKSGIVING

	I Thank Thee boundless Giver
	 That the thoughts Thou givest flow
	In sounds that like a river
	 All through the darkness go.
	And though few should swell the pleasure
	 By sharing this my wine
	My heart will clasp its treasure
	 This secret gift of Thine.
	
	My heart the joy inherits
	 And will oft be sung to rest;
	And some wandering hoping spirits
	 May listen and be blest.
	For the sound may break the hours
	 In a dark and gloomy mood
	As the wind breaks up the bowers
	 Of the brooding sunless wood.
	
	For every sound of gladness
	 Is a prophet-wind that tells
	Of a summer without sadness
	 And a love without farewells;
	And a heart that hath no ailing
	 And an eye that is not dim
	And a faith that without failing
	 Shall be complete in Him.
	
	And when my heart is mourning
	 The songs it lately gave
	Back to their fount returning
	 Make sweet the bitter wave;
	And forth a new stream floweth
	 In sunshine winding fair;
	And through the dark wood goeth
	 Glad laughter on the air.
	
	For the heart of man that waketh
	 Yet hath not ceased to dream
	Is the only fount that maketh
	 The sweet and bitter stream.
	But the sweet will still be flowing
	 When the bitter stream is dry
	And glad music only going
	 On the breezes of the sky.
	
	I thank Thee boundless Giver
	 That the thoughts Thou givest flow
	In sounds that like a river
	 All through the darkness go.
	And though few should swell the pleasure
	 By sharing this my wine
	My heart will clasp its treasure
	 This secret gift of Thine.


12. THE TREE’S PRAYER

	Alas! ‘tis cold and dark;
	The wind all night has sung a wintry tune;
	Hail from black clouds that swallowed up the moon
	Has beat against my bark.
	
	Oh! when will it be spring?
	The sap moves not within my withered veins;
	Through all my frozen roots creep numbing pains
	That they can hardly cling.
	
	The sun shone out last morn;
	I felt the warmth through every fibre float;
	I thought I heard a thrush’s piping note
	Of hope and sadness born.
	
	Then came the sea-cloud driven;
	The tempest hissed through all my outstretched boughs
	Hither and thither tossed me in its snows
	Beneath the joyless heaven.
	
	O for the sunny leaves!
	Almost I have forgot the breath of June!
	Forgot the feathery light-flakes from the moon!
	The praying summer-eves!
	
	O for the joyous birds
	Which are the tongues of us mute longing trees!
	O for the billowy odours and the bees
	Abroad in scattered herds!
	
	The blessing of cool showers!
	The gratefulness that thrills through every shoot!
	The children playing round my deep-sunk root
	Shadowed in hot noon hours!
	
	Alas! the cold clear dawn
	Through the bare lattice-work of twigs around!
	Another weary day of moaning sound
	On the thin-shadowed lawn!
	
	Yet winter’s noon is past:
	I’ll stretch my arms all night into the wind
	Endure all day the chill air and unkind;
	My leaves _will_ come at last.


13. THE WOMAN THAT CRIED IN THE CROWD

	She says within: “It is a man
	 A man of mother born;
	She is a woman--I am one
	 Alive this holy morn.”
	
	Filled with his words that flow in light
	 Her heart will break or cry:
	A woman’s cry bursts forth in might
	 Of loving agony.
	
	“Blessed the womb Thee Lord that bore!
	 The breast where Thou hast fed!”
	Storm-like those words the silence tore
	 Though words the silence bred.
	
	He ceases listens to the cry
	 And knows from whence it springs;
	A woman’s heart that glad would die
	 For this her best of things.
	
	Yet there is better than the birth
	 Of such a mighty son;
	Better than know of all the earth
	 Thyself the chosen one.
	
	“Yea rather blessed they that hear
	 And keep the word of God.”
	The voice was gentle not severe:
	 No answer came abroad.


14. THE WOMAN THAT WAS A SINNER

	She washes them with sorrow sweet
	 She wipes them with her hair;
	Her kisses soothe the weary feet
	 To all her kisses bare.
	
	The best of woman beauty’s crown
	 She spends upon his feet;
	Her eyes her lips her hair flung down
	 In one devotion meet.
	
	His face his words her heart had woke.
	 She judged Him well in sooth:
	Believing Him her bonds she broke
	 And fled to Him for truth.
	
	His holy manhood’s perfect worth
	 Redeems the woman’s ill:
	Her thanks intense to Him burn forth
	 Who owns her woman still.
	
	And so in kisses ointment tears
	 And outspread lavish hair
	An earnest of the coming years
	 Ascends her thankful prayer.
	
	If Mary too her hair did wind
	 The holy feet around;
	Such tears no virgin eyes could find
	 As this sad woman found.
	
	And if indeed his wayworn feet
	 With love she healed from pain;
	This woman found the homage meet
	 And taught it her again.
	
	The first in grief ah I let her be
	 And love that springs from woe;
	Woe soothed by Him more tenderly
	 That sin doth make it flow.
	
	Simon such kisses will not soil;
	 Her tears are pure as rain;
	Her hair--‘tis Love unwinds the coil
	 Love and her sister Pain.
	
	If He be kind for life she cares;
	 A light lights up the day;
	She to herself a value bears
	 Not yet a castaway.
	
	And evermore her heart arose
	 And ever sank away;
	For something crowned Him o’er her woes
	 More than her best could say.
	
	Rejoice sweet sisters holy pure
	 Who hardly know her case:
	There is no sin but has its cure
	 But finds its answering grace.
	
	Her heart although it sinned and sank
	 Rose other hearts above:
	Bless her dear sisters bless and thank
	 For teaching how to love.
	
	He from his own had welcome sad--
	 “Away with him“ said they;
	Yet never lord or poet had
	 Such homage in his day.
	
	Ah Lord! in whose forgiveness sweet
	 Our life becomes intense!
	We brothers sisters crowd thy feet--
	 Ah! make no difference.
