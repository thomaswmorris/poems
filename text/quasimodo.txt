*** Salvatore Quasimodo (1901 - 1968)


1. ENEMY OF DEATH

	You should not have
	ripped out your image
	taken from us, from the world,
	a portion of beauty.
	What can we do
	we enemies of death,
	bent to your feet of rose,
	your breast of violet?
	Not a word, not a scrap
	of your last day, a No
	to earth’s things, a No
	to our dull human record.
	The sad moon in summer,
	the dragging anchor, took
	your dreams, hills, trees,
	light, waters, darkness,
	not dim thoughts but truths,
	severed from the mind
	that suddenly decided,
	time and all future evil.
	Now you are shut
	behind heavy doors
	enemy of death.
	
	Who cries?
	You have blown out beauty
	with a breath, torn her,
	dealt her the death-wound,
	without a tear
	for her insensate shadow’s
	spreading over us.
	Destroyed solitude,
	and beauty, failed.
	You have signalled
	into the dark,
	inscribed your name in air,
	your No
	to everything that crowds here
	and beyond the wind.
	I know what you were
	looking for in your new dress.
	I understand the unanswered question.
	Neither for you nor us, a reply.
	Oh, flowers and moss,
	Oh, enemy of death.



2. IMITATION OF JOY

	Where the trees render
	the evening yet more abandoned,
	how indolently
	your last footstep vanishes
	that appears with the flower
	of the lime, and insists on its fate.
	You search for reason in affection,
	you experience silence in life.
	Another outcome reveals to me
	mirrored time. It grieves
	like death, beauty now
	flashes like lightning in other faces.
	I have lost every innocence,
	even in this voice that survives
	to imitate joy.



3. NOSTALGIA AND REGRET

	Now the day breaks
	night is done and the moon
	slowly dissolved in serene air
	sets in the canals.
	September is so alive in this country
	of plains, the meadows are green
	as in the southern valleys in spring.
	I have left my companions,
	I have hidden my heart behind ancient walls,
	to be alone, to remember.
	Since you are further off than the moon,
	now the day breaks
	and the horses’ hooves beat on the stones.



4. SUDDENLY IT’S EVENING

	Everyone is alone at the heart of the earth,
	pierced by a ray of sunshine;
	and suddenly it’s evening.



5. WIND AT TINDARI

	Tindari, I know you
	mild between broad hills, overhanging the waters
	of the god’s sweet islands.
	Today, you confront me
	and penetrate my heart.
	
	I climb airy peaks, precipices,
	following the wind in the pines,
	and the crowd of them, lightly accompanying me,
	fly off into the air,
	wave of love and sound,
	and you take me to you,
	you from whom I wrongly gathered
	evil, and fear of shadow, silence
	--refuge of sweetness, once certain--
	and death of spirit.
	
	It is unknown to you, that country
	where each day I go deep
	to nourish secret syllables:
	a different light bares you, behind the windows
	clothed in night,
	and another joy than mine
	rests on your breast.
	
	Exile is harsh
	and the search, for harmony, ending in you,
	changes today
	to a precocious anxiousness for death,
	and every love is a shield against sadness,
	a silent stair in the gloom,
	where you station me
	to break my bitter bread.
	
	Return, serene Tindari,
	stir me, sweet friend,
	to raise myself to the sky from the rock,
	so that I might shape fear, for those who do not know
	what deep wind has searched me.
