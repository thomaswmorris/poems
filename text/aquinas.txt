*** Thomas Aquinas (1225 - 1274)


1. PANGE LINGUA

	Sing, my tongue, the Saviour’s glory,
	Of His cross the mystery sing;
	Lift on high the wondrous trophy,
	Tell the triumph of the King:
	He, the world’s Redeemer, conquers
	Death, through death now vanquishing.
	
	Born for us, and for us given;
	Son of man, like us below,
	He, as Man with men, abiding
	Dwells, the seed of life to sow:
	He, our heavy griefs partaking,
	Thus fulfils His life of woe.
	
	Word made flesh! His word life-giving,
	Gives His flesh our meat to be,
	Bids us drink His blood, believing,
	Through His death, we life shall see:
	Blessed they who thus receiving
	Are from death and sin set free.
	
	Low in adoration bending,
	Now our hearts our God revere;
	Faith, her aid to sight is lending,
	Though unseen the Lord is near;
	Ancient types and shadows ending,
	Christ our paschal Lamb is here.
	
	Praise for ever, thanks and blessing,
	Thine, O gracious Father, be:
	Praise be Thine, O Christ, who bringeth
	Life and immortality.
	Praise be Thine, Thou quickening Spirit,
	Praise through all eternity. 


2. THEE WE ADORE

	Thee we adore, O hidden Savior, Thee,
	Who in Thy sacrament dost deign to be;
	Both flesh and spirit at Thy presence fail,
	Yet here Thy presence we devoutly hail.
	
	O blest memorial of our dying Lord,
	Who living Bread to men doth here afford!
	O may our souls forever feed on Thee,
	And Thou, O Christ, forever precious be.
	
	Fountain of gladness, Jesu, Lord and God,
	Cleanse us, unclean, with Thy most cleansing blood;
	Increase our faith and love, that we may know
	The hope and peace which from Thy presence flow.
	
	O Christ, Whom now beneath a veil we see,
	May what we thirst for soon our portion be,
	To gaze on Thee unveiled, and see Thy face,
	The vision of Thy glory and Thy grace.
