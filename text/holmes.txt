*** Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809 - 1894)


1. CONTENTMENT

	   _“Man wants but little here below”_
	
	Little I ask; my wants are few;
	I only wish a hut of stone,
	(A _very plain_ brown stone will do,)
	That I may call my own;--
	And close at hand is such a one,
	In yonder street that fronts the sun.
	
	Plain food is quite enough for me;
	Three courses are as good as ten;--
	If Nature can subsist on three,
	Thank Heaven for three. Amen!
	I always thought cold victual nice;--
	My _choice_ would be vanilla-ice.
	
	I care not much for gold or land;--
	Give me a mortgage here and there,--
	Some good bank-stock, some note of hand,
	Or trifling railroad share,--
	I only ask that Fortune send
	A _little_ more than I shall spend.
	
	Honors are silly toys, I know,
	And titles are but empty names;
	I would, _perhaps_, be Plenipo,--
	But only near St. James;
	I’m very sure I should not care
	To fill our Gubernator’s chair.
	
	Jewels are baubles; ’t is a sin
	To care for such unfruitful things;--
	One good-sized diamond in a pin,--
	Some, _not so large_, in rings,--
	A ruby, and a pearl, or so,
	Will do for me;--I laugh at show.
	
	My dame should dress in cheap attire;
	(Good, heavy silks are never dear;)--
	I own perhaps I _might_ desire
	Some shawls of true Cashmere,--
	Some marrowy crapes of China silk,
	Like wrinkled skins on scalded milk.
	
	I would not have the horse I drive
	So fast that folks must stop and stare;
	An easy gait--two forty-five--
	Suits me; I do not care;--
	Perhaps, for just a _single spurt_,
	Some seconds less would do no hurt.
	
	Of pictures, I should like to own
	Titians and Raphaels three or four,--
	I love so much their style and tone,
	One Turner, and no more,
	(A landscape,--foreground golden dirt,--
	The sunshine painted with a squirt.)
	
	Of books but few,--some fifty score
	For daily use, and bound for wear;
	The rest upon an upper floor;--
	Some _little_ luxury _there_
	Of red morocco’s gilded gleam
	And vellum rich as country cream.
	
	Busts, cameos, gems,--such things as these,
	Which others often show for pride,
	_I_ value for their power to please,
	And selfish churls deride;--
	_One_ Stradivarius, I confess,
	_Two_ Meerschaums, I would fain possess.
	
	Wealth’s wasteful tricks I will not learn,
	Nor ape the glittering upstart fool;--
	Shall not carved tables serve my turn,
	But _all_ must be of buhl?
	Give grasping pomp its double share,--
	I ask but _one_ recumbent chair.
	
	Thus humble let me live and die,
	Nor long for Midas’ golden touch;
	If Heaven more generous gifts deny,
	I shall not miss them _much_,--
	Too grateful for the blessing lent
	Of simple tastes and mind content!


2. DAILY TRIALS BY A SENSITIVE MAN

	Oh, there are times
	When all this fret and tumult that we hear
	Do seem more stale than to the sexton’s ear
	His own dull chimes.
	
	Ding dong! ding dong!
	The world is in a simmer like a sea
	Over a pent volcano,--woe is me
	All the day long!
	
	From crib to shroud!
	Nurse o’er our cradles screameth lullaby,
	And friends in boots tramp round us as we die,
	Snuffling aloud.
	
	At morning’s call
	The small-voiced pug-dog welcomes in the sun,
	And flea-bit mongrels, wakening one by one,
	Give answer all.
	
	When evening dim
	Draws round us, then the lonely caterwaul,
	Tart solo, sour duet, and general squall,--
	These are our hymn.
	
	Women, with tongues
	Like polar needles, ever on the jar;
	Men, plugless word-spouts, whose deep fountains are
	Within their lungs.
	
	Children, with drums
	Strapped round them by the fond paternal ass;
	Peripatetics with a blade of grass
	Between their thumbs.
	
	Vagrants, whose arts
	Have caged some devil in their mad machine,
	Which grinding, squeaks, with husky groans between,
	Come out by starts.
	
	Cockneys that kill
	Thin horses of a Sunday,--men, with clams,
	Hoarse as young bisons roaring for their dams
	From hill to hill.
	
	Soldiers, with guns,
	Making a nuisance of the blessed air,
	Child-crying bellman, children in despair,
	Screeching for buns.
	
	Storms, thunders, waves!
	Howl, crash, and bellow till ye get your fill;
	Ye sometimes rest; men never can be still
	But in their graves.


3. THE TWO STREAMS

	Behold the rocky wall
	That down its sloping sides
	Pours the swift rain-drops, blending, as they fall,
	In rushing river-tides!
	
	Yon stream, whose sources run
	Turned by a pebble’s edge,
	Is Athabasca, rolling toward the sun
	Through the cleft mountain-ledge.
	
	The slender rill had strayed,
	But for the slanting stone,
	To evening’s ocean, with the tangled braid
	Of foam-flecked Oregon.
	
	So from the heights of Will
	Life’s parting stream descends,
	And, as a moment turns its slender rill,
	Each widening torrent bends,--
	
	From the same cradle’s side,
	From the same mother’s knee,--
	One to long darkness and the frozen tide,
	One to the Peaceful Sea!
