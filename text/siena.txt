*** Catherine of Siena (1347 - 1380)


1. CONSUMED IN GRACE

	I first saw God when I was a child, six years of age.
	The cheeks of the sun were pale before Him,
	and the earth acted as a shy
	girl, like me.
	
	Divine light entered my heart from His love
	that did never fully wane,
	
	though indeed, dear, I can understand how a person’s
	faith can at times flicker,
	
	for what is the mind to do
	with something that becomes the mind’s ruin:
	a God that consumes us
	in His grace.
	
	I have seen what you want;
	it is there,
	
	a Beloved of infinite
	tenderness.



2. THE HYMNS OF THE EARTH

	I wanted to be a hermit and only hear the hymns
	of the earth, and the laughter of the sky,
	
	and the sweet gossip of the creatures on my limbs,
	the forests.
	
	I wanted to be a hermit and not see another face
	look upon mine and tell me I was not all the beauty in this world.
	
	For so many faces do that--
	cage us.
	
	The wings we have are so fragile
	they can break from just
	one word, or
	
	a glance void
	of love.
	
	I wanted to live in that cloister of
	light’s silence
	
	because, is it not true, the heart
	is so fragile and shy.



3. I WON’T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER

	“I won’t take no for an answer,”
	God began to say
	to me
	
	when He opened His arms each night
	wanting us to
	dance.



4. UNTIL YOUR OWN DAWN

	Daybreak:
	everything in this world is a luminous divine dream
	I have spun.
	
	I did not know life was a fabric woven by my soul.
	Any form that can appear to you--should I confess this?--
	it is something I made.
	All roots nurse
	from
	me.
	
	God’s art is mine. I did not want His divine talent.
	It simply grew in my heart from
	the way I
	loved.
	
	Existence is as a young child moving through
	a lane at night;
	
	it wanted to
	hold my
	hand.
	
	Here, dear earth, hold me,
	until your own
	dawn.



5. WE WERE ENCLOSED

	We were enclosed,
	O eternal Father,
	within the garden of your breast.
	You drew us out of your holy mind
	like a flower
	petaled with our soul’s three powers,
	and into each power
	you put the whole plant,
	so that they might bear fruit in your garden,
	might come back to you
	with the fruit you gave them.
	And you would come back to the soul,
	to fill her with your blessedness.
	There the soul dwells--
	like the fish in the sea
	and the sea in the fish.
