*** Donald Davie (1922 - 1995)


1. ACROSS THE BAY

	A queer thing about those waters: there are no Birds there, or hardly any.
	I did not miss them, I do not remember
	Missing them, or thinking it uncanny.
	
	The beach so-called was a blinding splinter of limestone,
	A quarry outraged by hulls.
	We took pleasure in that: the emptiness, the hardness
	Of the light, the silence, and the water’s stillness.
	
	But this was the setting for one of our murderous scenes.
	This hurt, and goes on hurting:
	The venomous soft jelly, the undersides.
	We could stand the world if it were hard all over.



2. COASTAL REDWOODS

	Imagination moves
	Along with damping reason
	Through unimpressive trees
	In famous giant groves.
	
	For trunks of girth with this
	That’s dead, its rings all numbered,
	Need not have lived its sum
	Of compact centuries.
	
	From mutable bark and leaf,
	Mere bulk’s persistence, idle,
	Boredom thus justified,
	I turn in mild relief
	
	And meet Identity’s
	Presence, achieved self-sameness,
	Being that proves its claim
	Living, a tree of trees!
	
	Two hundred and thirty feet
	Stout tapering, unbroken
	Poured to the sky and spoke
	Unasked, unspanned, complete.



3. IN CALIFORNIA

	Chemicals ripen the citrus;
	There are rattlesnakes in the mountains,
	And on the shoreline
	Hygiene, inhuman caution.
	
	Beef in cellophane
	Tall as giraffes,
	The orange-rancher’s daughters
	Crop their own groves, mistrustful.
	
	Perpetual summer seems
	Precarious on the littoral. We drive
	Inland to prove
	The risk we sense. At once
	
	Winter claps-to like a shutter
	High over the Ojai valley, and discloses
	A double crisis,
	Winter and Drought.
	
	Ranges on mountain-ranges,
	Empty, unwatered, crumbling,
	Hot colours come at the eye.
	It is too cold
	
	For picnics at the trestle-tables. Claypit
	Yellow burns on the distance.
	The phantom walks
	Everywhere, of intolerable heat.
	
	At Ventucopa, elevation
	Two-eight-nine-six, the water hydrant frozen,
	Deserted or broken settlements,
	Gasoline stations closed and boarded.
	
	By nightfall, to the snows;
	And over the mile on tilted
	Mile of the mountain park
	The bright cars hazarded.



4. JULY

	For work like mine, fine weather is inclement.
	“Know when to stop,” breathes hoarse July,
	A stalk in his blistered mouth.
	“Whatever end
	You seem to reach this month is fraudulent.”
	
	He would be cool: I see his bushy tufts
	Toss in their hanging ranks, or inky single
	In steeps of corn promise a stone-cold shade;
	And all such ovens, funnels of hot draughts!
	
	Frigidity can every day outwit
	And stone-cold stone outstrip him. But to freeze
	Distress and torpor in a finished gesture,
	Hard as it is, is not the half of it.
	
	Whatever would be natural is begun
	With a more troubled feeling: we’ve a duty,
	If nothing natural bears with finishing,
	To leave our work dishevelled and half-done.



5. THE RED MILLS

	Each of us has the time,
	And both the times are wrong.
	Our needs and likings chime
	Sometimes, but not for long.
	
	Your watch is often fast,
	Mine usually slow.
	And yet you cling to the past,
	I laxly let it go.
	
	You are like a ferryman’s daughter,
	And I the stream that blurred
	Calls sent across that water
	Which loyally you have heard.
	
	My lapsings I acknowledge.
	And yet, on either hand
	Combed green, the river’s sedge
	Sweetens the fishwives’ island.
	
	But loyalty strings the reaches
	A river only spills.
	Necklace of bluffs and beaches,
	And the rubies under the mills!



6. A SPRING SONG

	   _“stooped to truth and moralized his song”﻿_
	
	Spring pricks a little. I get out the maps.
	Time to demoralize my song, high time.
	Vernal a little. _Primavera._ First
	Green, first truth and last.
	High time, high time.
	
	A high old time we had of it last summer?
	I overstate. But getting out the maps . . .
	Look! Up the valley of the Brenne,
	Louise de la Vallière . . . Syntax collapses.
	High time for that, high time.
	
	To Château-Renault, the tannery town whose marquis
	Rooke and James Butler whipped in Vigo Bay
	Or so the song says, an amoral song
	Like Ronsard’s where we go today
	Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow.
	
	Tomorrow and tomorrow and . . . Get well!
	Philip’s black-sailed familiar, avaunt
	Or some word as ridiculous, the whole
	Diction kit begins to fall apart.
	High time it did, high time.
	
	High time and a long time yet, my love!
	Get out that blessed map.
	Ageing, you take your glasses off to read it.
	Stooping to truth, we potter to Montoire.
	High time, my love. High time and a long time yet.
