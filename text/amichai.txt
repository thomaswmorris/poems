*** Yehuda Amichai (1924 - 2000)


1. BEFORE

	Before the gate has been closed, 
	before the last question is posed, 
	before I am transposed. 
	
	Before the weeds fill the gardens, 
	before there are no pardons, 
	before the concrete hardens. 
	
	Before all the flute-holes are covered, 
	before things are locked in the cupboard, 
	before the rules are discovered. 
	
	Before the conclusion is planned, 
	before God closes his hand, 
	before we have nowhere to stand. 



2. A MAN DOESN’T HAVE TIME IN HIS LIFE

	A man doesn’t have time in his life
	to have time for everything.
	He doesn’t have seasons enough to have
	a season for every purpose. Ecclesiastes
	Was wrong about that.
	
	A man needs to love and to hate at the same moment,
	to laugh and cry with the same eyes,
	with the same hands to throw stones and to gather them,
	to make love in war and war in love.
	And to hate and forgive and remember and forget,
	to arrange and confuse, to eat and to digest
	what history 
	takes years and years to do.
	
	A man doesn’t have time.
	When he loses he seeks, when he finds
	he forgets, when he forgets he loves, when he loves
	he begins to forget.
	
	And his soul is seasoned, his soul
	is very professional.
	Only his body remains forever
	an amateur. It tries and it misses,
	gets muddled, doesn’t learn a thing,
	drunk and blind in its pleasures 
	and its pains.
	
	He will die as figs die in autumn,
	Shriveled and full of himself and sweet,
	the leaves growing dry on the ground,
	the bare branches pointing to the place
	where there’s time for everything.



3. A PITY

	They amputated
	Your thighs off my hips.
	As far as I’m concerned
	They are all surgeons. All of them.
	
	They dismantled us
	Each from the other.
	As far as I’m concerned
	They are all engineers. All of them.
	
	A pity. We were such a good
	And loving invention.
	An aeroplane made from a man and wife.
	Wings and everything.
	We hovered above the earth.
	
	We even flew a little.
