*** Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892 - 1950)


1. AFTERNOON ON A HILL

	I will be the gladdest thing
	 Under the sun!
	I will touch a hundred flowers
	 And not pick one.
	
	I will look at cliffs and clouds
	 With quiet eyes
	Watch the wind bow down the grass
	 And the grass rise.
	
	And when lights begin to show
	 Up from the town
	I will mark which must be mine
	 And then start down.


2. ASHES OF LIFE

	Love has gone and left me and the days are all alike;
	 Eat I must and sleep I will--and would that night were here!
	But ah!--to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike!
	 Would that it were day again!--with twilight near!
	
	Love has gone and left me and I don’t know what to do;
	 This or that or what you will is all the same to me;
	But all the things that I begin I leave before I’m through--
	 There’s little use in anything as far as I can see.
	
	Love has gone and left me--and the neighbours knock and borrow
	 And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse--
	And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow
	 There’s this little street and this little house.


3. BLIGHT

	Hard seeds of hate I planted
	 That should by now be grown--
	Rough stalks and from thick stamens
	 A poisonous pollen blown
	And odours rank unbreathable
	 From dark corollas thrown!
	
	At dawn from my damp garden
	 I shook the chilly dew;
	The thin boughs locked behind me
	 That sprang to let me through;
	The blossoms slept--I sought a place
	 Where nothing lovely grew.
	
	And there when day was breaking
	 I knelt and looked around:
	The light was near the silence
	 Was palpitant with sound;
	I drew my hate from out my breast
	 And thrust it in the ground.
	
	Oh ye so fiercely tended
	 Ye little seeds of hate!
	I bent above your growing
	 Early and noon and late
	Yet are ye drooped and pitiful--
	 I cannot rear ye straight!
	
	The sun seeks out my garden
	 No nook is left in shade
	No mist nor mould nor mildew
	 Endures on any blade
	Sweet rain slants under every bough:
	 Ye falter and ye fade.


4. CITY TREES

	The trees along this city street
	 Save for the traffic and the trains
	Would make a sound as thin and sweet
	 As trees in country lanes.
	
	And people standing in their shade
	 Out of a shower undoubtedly
	Would hear such music as is made
	 Upon a country tree.
	
	Oh little leaves that are so dumb
	 Against the shrieking city air
	I watch you when the wind has come--
	 I know what sound is there.


5. ELAINE

	Oh come again to Astolat!
	 I will not ask you to be kind.
	And you may go when you will go
	 And I will stay behind.
	
	I will not say how dear you are
	 Or ask you if you hold me dear
	Or trouble you with things for you
	 The way I did last year.
	
	So still the orchard Lancelot
	 So very still the lake shall be
	You could not guess--though you should guess--
	 What is become of me.
	
	So wide shall be the garden-walk
	 The garden-seat so very wide
	You needs must think--if you should think--
	 The lily maid had died.
	
	Save that a little way away
	 I’d watch you for a little while
	To see you speak the way you speak
	 And smile--if you should smile.


6. GOD’S WORLD

	O world I cannot hold thee close enough!
	     Thy winds thy wide grey skies!
	     Thy mists that roll and rise!
	Thy woods this autumn day that ache and sag
	And all but cry with colour! That gaunt crag
	To crush! To lift the lean of that black bluff!
	World World I cannot get thee close enough!
	
	Long have I known a glory in it all
	     But never knew I this;
	     Here such a passion is
	As stretcheth me apart--Lord I do fear
	Thou’st made the world too beautiful this year;
	My soul is all but out of me--let fall
	No burning leaf; prithee let no bird call.


7. INDIFFERENCE

	I said--for Love was laggard O Love was slow to come--
	 “I’ll hear his step and know his step when I am warm in bed;
	But I’ll never leave my pillow though there be some
	 As would let him in--and take him in with tears!” I said.
	I lay--for Love was laggard O he came not until dawn--
	I lay and listened for his step and could not get to sleep;
	And he found me at my window with my big cloak on
	 All sorry with the tears some folks might weep!


8. JOURNEY

	Ah could I lay me down in this long grass
	And close my eyes and let the quiet wind
	Blow over me--I am so tired so tired
	Of passing pleasant places! All my life
	Following Care along the dusty road
	Have I looked back at loveliness and sighed;
	Yet at my hand an unrelenting hand
	Tugged ever and I passed. All my life long
	   Over my shoulder have I looked at peace
	   And now I fain would lie in this long grass
	   And close my eyes.
	                     Yet onward!
	                               Cat-birds call
	Through the long afternoon and creeks at dusk
	Are guttural. Whip-poor-wills wake and cry
	Drawing the twilight close about their throats.
	Only my heart makes answer. Eager vines
	Go up the rocks and wait; flushed apple-trees
	Pause in their dance and break the ring for me;
	Dim shady wood-roads redolent of fern
	And bayberry that through sweet bevies thread
	Of round-faced roses pink and petulant
	Look back and beckon ere they disappear.
	Only my heart only my heart responds.
	Yet ah my path is sweet on either side
	All through the dragging day--sharp underfoot
	And hot and like dead mist the dry dust hangs--
	But far oh far as passionate eye can reach
	And long ah long as rapturous eye can cling
	The world is mine: blue hill still silver lake
	Broad field bright flower and the long white road
	A gateless garden and an open path:
	My feet to follow and my heart to hold.


9. MY CANDLE BURNS AT BOTH ENDS

	My candle burns at both ends;
	 It will not last the night;
	But ah my foes and oh my friends--
	 It gives a lovely light!


10. PASTORAL

	If it were only still!--
	With far away the shrill
	Crying of a cock;
	Or the shaken bell
	From a cow’s throat
	Moving through the bushes;
	Or the soft shock
	Of wizened apples falling
	From an old tree
	In a forgotten orchard
	Upon the hilly rock!
	
	Oh grey hill
	Where the grazing herd
	Licks the purple blossom
	Crops the spiky weed!
	Oh stony pasture
	Where the tall mullein
	Stands up so sturdy
	On its little seed!


11. RENASCENCE

	All I could see from where I stood
	Was three long mountains and a wood;
	I turned and looked another way
	And saw three islands in a bay.
	So with my eyes I traced the line
	Of the horizon thin and fine
	Straight around till I was come
	Back to where I’d started from
	And all I saw from where I stood
	Was three long mountains and a wood.
	Over these things I could not see:
	These were the things that bounded me;
	And I could touch them with my hand
	Almost I thought from where I stand.
	And all at once things seemed so small
	My breath came short and scarce at all.
	But sure the sky is big I said;
	Miles and miles above my head;
	So here upon my back I’ll lie
	And look my fill into the sky.
	And so I looked and after all
	The sky was not so very tall.
	The sky I said must somewhere stop
	And--sure enough!--I see the top!
	The sky I thought is not so grand;
	I ’most could touch it with my hand!
	And reaching up my hand to try
	I screamed to feel it touch the sky.
	
	I screamed and--lo!--Infinity
	Came down and settled over me;
	Forced back my scream into my chest
	Bent back my arm upon my breast
	And pressing of the Undefined
	The definition on my mind
	Held up before my eyes a glass
	Through which my shrinking sight did pass
	Until it seemed I must behold
	Immensity made manifold;
	Whispered to me a word whose sound
	Deafened the air for worlds around
	And brought unmuffled to my ears
	The gossiping of friendly spheres
	The creaking of the tented sky
	The ticking of Eternity.
	I saw and heard and knew at last
	The How and Why of all things past
	And present and for evermore.
	The Universe cleft to the core
	Lay open to my probing sense
	That sick’ning I would fain pluck thence
	But could not--nay! But needs must suck
	At the great wound and could not pluck
	My lips away till I had drawn
	All venom out.--Ah fearful pawn!
	For my omniscience paid I toll
	In infinite remorse of soul.
	All sin was of my sinning all
	Atoning mine and mine the gall
	Of all regret. Mine was the weight
	Of every brooded wrong the hate
	That stood behind each envious thrust
	Mine every greed mine every lust.
	And all the while for every grief
	Each suffering I craved relief
	With individual desire--
	Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire
	About a thousand people crawl;
	Perished with each--then mourned for all!
	A man was starving in Capri;
	He moved his eyes and looked at me;
	I felt his gaze I heard his moan
	And knew his hunger as my own.
	I saw at sea a great fog bank
	Between two ships that struck and sank;
	A thousand screams the heavens smote;
	And every scream tore through my throat.
	No hurt I did not feel no death
	That was not mine; mine each last breath
	That crying met an answering cry
	From the compassion that was I.
	All suffering mine and mine its rod;
	Mine pity like the pity of God.
	Ah awful weight! Infinity
	Pressed down upon the finite Me!
	My anguished spirit like a bird
	Beating against my lips I heard;
	Yet lay the weight so close about
	There was no room for it without.
	And so beneath the weight lay I
	And suffered death but could not die.
	
	Long had I lain thus craving death
	When quietly the earth beneath
	Gave way and inch by inch so great
	At last had grown the crushing weight
	Into the earth I sank till I
	Full six feet under ground did lie
	And sank no more--there is no weight
	Can follow here however great.
	From off my breast I felt it roll
	And as it went my tortured soul
	Burst forth and fled in such a gust
	That all about me swirled the dust.
	Deep in the earth I rested now;
	Cool is its hand upon the brow
	And soft its breast beneath the head
	Of one who is so gladly dead.
	And all at once and over all
	The pitying rain began to fall;
	I lay and heard each pattering hoof
	Upon my lowly thatchèd roof
	And seemed to love the sound far more
	Than ever I had done before.
	For rain it hath a friendly sound
	To one who’s six feet under ground;
	And scarce the friendly voice or face:
	A grave is such a quiet place.
	
	The rain I said is kind to come
	And speak to me in my new home.
	I would I were alive again
	To kiss the fingers of the rain
	To drink into my eyes the shine
	Of every slanting silver line
	To catch the freshened fragrant breeze
	From drenched and dripping apple-trees.
	For soon the shower will be done
	And then the broad face of the sun
	Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth
	Until the world with answering mirth
	Shakes joyously and each round drop
	Rolls twinkling from its grass-blade top.
	How can I bear it buried here
	While overhead the sky grows clear
	And blue again after the storm?
	O multi-coloured multiform
	Beloved beauty over me
	That I shall never never see
	Again! Spring-silver autumn-gold
	That I shall never more behold!
	Sleeping your myriad magics through
	Close-sepulchred away from you!
	O God I cried give me new birth
	And put me back upon the earth!
	Upset each cloud’s gigantic gourd
	And let the heavy rain down-poured
	In one big torrent set me free
	Washing my grave away from me!
	
	I ceased; and through the breathless hush
	That answered me the far-off rush
	Of herald wings came whispering
	Like music down the vibrant string
	Of my ascending prayer and--crash!
	Before the wild wind’s whistling lash
	The startled storm-clouds reared on high
	And plunged in terror down the sky
	And the big rain in one black wave
	Fell from the sky and struck my grave.
	I know not how such things can be;
	I only know there came to me
	A fragrance such as never clings
	To aught save happy living things;
	A sound as of some joyous elf
	Singing sweet songs to please himself
	And through and over everything
	A sense of glad awakening.
	The grass a-tiptoe at my ear
	Whispering to me I could hear;
	I felt the rain’s cool finger-tips
	Brushed tenderly across my lips
	Laid gently on my sealèd sight
	And all at once the heavy night
	Fell from my eyes and I could see--
	A drenched and dripping apple-tree
	A last long line of silver rain
	A sky grown clear and blue again.
	And as I looked a quickening gust
	Of wind blew up to me and thrust
	Into my face a miracle
	Of orchard-breath and with the smell--
	I know not how such things can be!--
	I breathed my soul back into me.
	
	Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I
	And hailed the earth with such a cry
	As is not heard save from a man
	Who has been dead and lives again.
	About the trees my arms I wound;
	Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;
	I raised my quivering arms on high;
	I laughed and laughed into the sky
	Till at my throat a strangling sob
	Caught fiercely and a great heart-throb
	Sent instant tears into my eyes;
	O God I cried no dark disguise
	Can e’er hereafter hide from me
	Thy radiant identity!
	Thou canst not move across the grass
	But my quick eyes will see Thee pass
	Nor speak however silently
	But my hushed voice will answer Thee.
	I know the path that tells Thy way
	Through the cool eve of every day;
	God I can push the grass apart
	And lay my finger on Thy heart!
	
	The world stands out on either side
	No wider than the heart is wide;
	Above the world is stretched the sky--
	No higher than the soul is high.
	The heart can push the sea and land
	Farther away on either hand;
	The soul can split the sky in two
	And let the face of God shine through.
	But East and West will pinch the heart
	That cannot keep them pushed apart;
	And he whose soul is flat--the sky
	Will cave in on him by and by.


12. SONG OF A SECOND APRIL

	April this year not otherwise
	 Than April of a year ago
	Is full of whispers full of sighs
	 Of dazzling mud and dingy snow;
	 Hepaticas that pleased you so
	Are here again and butterflies.
	
	There rings a hammering all day
	 And shingles lie about the doors;
	In orchards near and far away
	 The grey woodpecker taps and bores;
	 And men are merry at their chores
	And children earnest at their play.
	
	The larger streams run still and deep
	 Noisy and swift the small brooks run
	Among the mullein stalks the sheep
	 Go up the hillside in the sun
	 Pensively--only you are gone
	You that alone I cared to keep.


13. SPRING

	To what purpose April do you return again?
	Beauty is not enough.
	You can no longer quiet me with the redness
	Of little leaves opening stickily.
	I know what I know.
	The sun is hot on my neck as I observe
	The spikes of the crocus.
	The smell of the earth is good.
	It is apparent that there is no death.
	But what does that signify?
	Not only under ground are the brains of men
	Eaten by maggots.
	Life in itself
	Is nothing
	An empty cup a flight of uncarpeted stairs.
	It is not enough that yearly down this hill
	April
	Comes like an idiot babbling and strewing flowers.


14. TAVERN

	I’ll keep a little tavern
	 Below the high hill’s crest
	Wherein all grey-eyed people
	 May sit them down and rest.
	
	There shall be plates a-plenty
	 And mugs to melt the chill
	Of all the grey-eyed people
	 Who happen up the hill.
	
	There sound will sleep the traveller
	 And dream his journey’s end
	But I will rouse at midnight
	 The falling fire to tend.
	
	Aye ’tis a curious fancy--
	 But all the good I know
	Was taught me out of two grey eyes
	 A long time ago.


15. THREE SONGS OF SHATTERING

	I
	
	 The first rose on my rose-tree
	   Budded bloomed and shattered
	 During sad days when to me
	   Nothing mattered.
	
	 Grief of grief has drained me clean;
	   Still it seems a pity
	 No one saw--it must have been
	     Very pretty.
	
	
	II
	
	 Let the little birds sing;
	   Let the little lambs play;
	 Spring is here; and so ’tis spring;--
	   But not in the old way!
	
	 I recall a place
	   Where a plum-tree grew;
	 There you lifted up your face
	   And blossoms covered you.
	
	 If the little birds sing
	   And the little lambs play
	 Spring is here; and so ’tis spring--
	   But not in the old way!
	
	
	III
	
	 All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree!
	   Ere spring was going--ah! spring is gone!
	 And there comes no summer to the like of you and me--
	   Blossom time is early but no fruit sets on.
	
	 All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree
	   Browned at the edges turned in a day;
	 And I would with all my heart they trimmed a mound for me
	   And weeds were tall on all the paths that led that way!


16. WHEN THE YEAR GROWS OLD

	I cannot but remember
	 When the year grows old--
	October--November--
	 How she disliked the cold!
	
	She used to watch the swallows
	 Go down across the sky
	And turn from the window
	 With a little sharp sigh.
	
	And often when the brown leaves
	 Were brittle on the ground
	And the wind in the chimney
	 Made a melancholy sound
	
	She had a look about her
	 That I wish I could forget--
	The look of a scared thing
	 Sitting in a net!
	
	Oh beautiful at nightfall
	 The soft spitting snow!
	And beautiful the bare boughs
	 Rubbing to and fro!
	
	But the roaring of the fire
	 And the warmth of fur
	And the boiling of the kettle
	 Were beautiful to her!
	
	I cannot but remember
	 When the year grows old--
	October--November--
	 How she disliked the cold!


17. WILD SWANS

	I looked in my heart while the wild swans went over.
	And what did I see I had not seen before?
	Only a question less or a question more;
	Nothing to match the flight of wild birds flying.
	Tiresome heart forever living and dying
	House without air I leave you and lock your door.
	Wild swans come over the town come over
	The town again trailing your legs and crying!
