*** Alexander Blok (1880 - 1921)


1. THE STRANGER

	The restaurants on hot spring evenings
	Lie under a dense and savage air.
	Foul drafts and hoots from dunken revelers
	Contaminate the thoroughfare.
	Above the dusty lanes of suburbia
	Above the tedium of bungalows
	A pretzel sign begilds a bakery
	And children screech fortissimo.
	
	And every evening beyond the barriers
	Gentlemen of practiced wit and charm
	Go strolling beside the drainage ditches--
	A tilted derby and a lady at the arm.
	
	The squeak of oarlocks comes over the lake water
	A woman’s shriek assaults the ear
	While above, in the sky, inured to everything,
	The moon looks on with a mindless leer.
	
	And every evening my one companion
	Sits here, reflected in my glass.
	Like me, he has drunk of bitter mysteries.
	Like me, he is broken, dulled, downcast.
	
	The sleepy lackeys stand beside tables
	Waiting for the night to pass
	And tipplers with the eyes of rabbits
	Cry out: “In vino veritas!”
	
	And every evening (or am I imagining?)
	Exactly at the appointed time
	A girl’s slim figure, silk raimented,
	Glides past the window’s mist and grime.
	
	And slowly passing throught the revelers,
	Unaccompanied, always alone,
	Exuding mists and secret fragrances,
	She sits at the table that is her own.
	
	Something ancient, something legendary
	Surrounds her presence in the room,
	Her narrow hand, her silk, her bracelets,
	Her hat, the rings, the ostrich plume.
	
	Entranced by her presence, near and enigmatic,
	I gaze through the dark of her lowered veil
	And I behold an enchanted shoreline
	And enchanted distances, far and pale.
	
	I am made a guardian of the higher mysteries,
	Someone’s sun is entrusted to my control.
	Tart wine has pierced the last convolution
	of my labyrinthine soul.
	
	And now the drooping plumes of ostriches
	Asway in my brain droop slowly lower
	And two eyes, limpid, blue, and fathomless
	Are blooming on a distant shore.
	
	Inside my soul a treasure is buried.
	The key is mine and only mine.
	How right you are, you drunken monster!
	I know: the truth is in the wine.


2. TO THE MUSE

	In your hidden memories
	There are fatal tidings of doom . . .
	A curse on sacred traditions,
	A desecration of happiness;
	
	And a power so alluring
	That I am ready to repeat the rumour
	That you have brought angels down from heaven,
	Enticing them with your beauty . . .
	
	And when you mock at faith,
	That pale, greyish-purple halo
	Which I once saw before
	Suddenly begins to shine above you.
	
	Are you evil or good? You are altogether from another world
	They say strange things about you
	For some you are the Muse and a miracle.
	For me you are torment and hell.
	
	I do not know why in the hour of dawn,
	When no strength was left to me,
	I did not perish, but caught sight of your face
	And begged you to comfort me.
	
	I wanted us to be enemies;
	Why then did you make me a present
	Of a flowery meadow and of the starry firmament--
	The whole curse of your beauty?
	
	Your fearful caresses were more treacherous
	Than the northern night,
	More intoxicating than the golden champagne of Aï,
	Briefer than a gypsy woman’s love . . .
	
	And there was a fatal pleasure
	In trampling on cherished and holy things;
	And this passion, bitter as wormwood,
	Was a frenzied delight for the heart!
