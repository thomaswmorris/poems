*** Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 - 1882)


1. EXPERIENCE

	The lords of life, the lords of life,--
	I saw them pass,
	In their own guise,
	Like and unlike,
	Portly and grim,--
	Use and Surprise,
	Surface and Dream,
	Succession swift and spectral Wrong,
	Temperament without a tongue,
	And the inventor of the game
	Omnipresent without name;--
	Some to see, some to be guessed,
	They marched from east to west:
	Little man, least of all,
	Among the legs of his guardians tall,
	Walked about with puzzled look.
	Him by the hand dear Nature took,
	Dearest Nature, strong and kind,
	Whispered, ‘Darling, never mind!
	To-morrow they will wear another face,
	The founder thou; these are thy race!’



2. GIVE ALL TO LOVE

	Give all to love;
	Obey thy heart;
	Friends, kindred, days,
	Estate, good-fame,
	Plans, credit and the Muse,--
	Nothing refuse.

	’T is a brave master;
	Let it have scope:
	Follow it utterly,
	Hope beyond hope:
	High and more high
	It dives into noon,
	With wing unspent,
	Untold intent:
	But it is a god,
	Knows its own path
	And the outlets of the sky.

	It was never for the mean;
	It requireth courage stout.
	Souls above doubt,
	Valor unbending,
	It will reward,--
	They shall return
	More than they were,
	And ever ascending.

	Leave all for love;
	Yet, hear me, yet,
	One word more thy heart behoved,
	One pulse more of firm endeavor,--
	Keep thee to-day,
	To-morrow, forever,
	Free as an Arab
	Of thy beloved.

	Cling with life to the maid;
	But when the surprise,
	First vague shadow of surmise
	Flits across her bosom young,
	Of a joy apart from thee,
	Free be she, fancy-free;
	Nor thou detain her vesture’s hem,
	Nor the palest rose she flung
	From her summer diadem.

	Though thou loved her as thyself,
	As a self of purer clay,
	Though her parting dims the day,
	Stealing grace from all alive;
	Heartily know,
	When half-gods go,
	The gods arrive.



3. GOOD-BYE

	Good-bye, proud world! I’m going home:
	Thou art not my friend, and I’m not thine.
	Long through thy weary crowds I roam;
	A river-ark on the ocean brine,
	Long I’ve been tossed like the driven foam;
	But now, proud world! I’m going home.

	Good-bye to Flattery’s fawning face;
	To Grandeur with his wise grimace;
	To upstart Wealth’s averted eye;
	To supple Office, low and high;
	To crowded halls, to court and street;
	To frozen hearts and hasting feet;
	To those who go, and those who come;
	Good-bye, proud world! I’m going home.

	I am going to my own hearth-stone,
	Bosomed in yon green hills alone,--
	A secret nook in a pleasant land,
	Whose groves the frolic fairies planned;
	Where arches green, the livelong day,
	Echo the blackbird’s roundelay,
	And vulgar feet have never trod
	A spot that is sacred to thought and God.

	O, when I am safe in my sylvan home,
	I tread on the pride of Greece and Rome;
	And when I am stretched beneath the pines,
	Where the evening star so holy shines,
	I laugh at the lore and the pride of man,
	At the sophist schools, and the learned clan;
	For what are they all, in their high conceit,
	When man in the bush with God may meet?



4. ODE TO BEAUTY

	Who gave thee, O Beauty,
	The keys of this breast,--
	Too credulous lover
	Of blest and unblest?
	Say, when in lapsed ages
	Thee knew I of old;
	Or what was the service
	For which I was sold?
	When first my eyes saw thee,
	I found me thy thrall,
	By magical drawings,
	Sweet tyrant of all!
	I drank at thy fountain
	False waters of thirst;
	Thou intimate stranger,
	Thou latest and first!
	Thy dangerous glances
	Make women of men;
	New-born, we are melting
	Into nature again.

	Lavish, lavish promiser,
	Nigh persuading gods to err!
	Guest of million painted forms,
	Which in turn thy glory warms!
	The frailest leaf, the mossy bark,
	The acorn’s cup, the raindrop’s arc,
	The swinging spider’s silver line,
	The ruby of the drop of wine,
	The shining pebble of the pond,
	Thou inscribest with a bond
	In thy momentary play,
	Would bankrupt nature to repay.

	Ah, what avails it
	To hide or to shun
	Whom the Infinite One
	Hath granted his throne?
	The heaven high over
	Is the deep’s lover;
	The sun and sea,
	Informed by thee,
	Before me run
	And draw me on,
	Yet fly me still,
	As Fate refuses
	To me the heart Fate for me chooses.
	Is it that my opulent soul
	Was mingled from the generous whole;
	Sea-valleys and the deep of skies
	Furnished several supplies;
	And the sands whereof I’m made
	Draw me to them, self-betrayed?
	I turn the proud portfolio
	Which holds the grand designs
	Of Salvator, of Guercino,
	And Piranesi’s lines.
	I hear the lofty paeans
	Of the masters of the shell,
	Who heard the starry music
	And recount the numbers well;
	Olympian bards who sung
	Divine Ideas below,
	Which always find us young
	And always keep us so.
	Oft in streets or humblest places,
	I detect far-wandered graces,
	Which, from Eden wide astray,
	In lowly homes have lost their way.

	Thee gliding through the sea of form,
	Like the lightning through the storm,
	Somewhat not to be possessed,
	Somewhat not to be caressed,
	No feet so fleet could ever find,
	No perfect form could ever bind.
	Thou eternal fugitive,
	Hovering over all that live,
	Quick and skilful to inspire
	Sweet, extravagant desire,
	Starry space and lily-bell
	Filling with thy roseate smell,
	Wilt not give the lips to taste
	Of the nectar which thou hast.

	All that’s good and great with thee
	Works in close conspiracy;
	Thou hast bribed the dark and lonely
	To report thy features only,
	And the cold and purple morning
	Itself with thoughts of thee adorning;
	The leafy dell, the city mart,
	Equal trophies of thine art;
	E’en the flowing azure air
	Thou hast touched for my despair;
	And, if I languish into dreams,
	Again I meet the ardent beams.

	Queen of things! I dare not die
	In Being’s deeps past ear and eye;
	Lest there I find the same deceiver.
	And be the sport of Fate forever.
	Dread Power, but dear! if God thou be,
	Unmake me quite, or give thyself to me!



5. THE SNOW-STORM

	Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,
	Arrives the snow, and, driving o’er the fields,
	Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air
	Hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven,
	And veils the farm-house at the garden’s end.
	The sled and traveller stopped, the courier’s feet
	Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit
	Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed
	In a tumultuous privacy of storm.

	Come see the north wind’s masonry.
	Out of an unseen quarry evermore
	Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer
	Curves his white bastions with projected roof
	Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.
	Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work
	So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he
	For number or proportion. Mockingly,
	On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths;
	A swan-like form invests the hidden thorn;
	Fills up the farmer’s lane from wall to wall,
	Maugre the farmer’s sighs; and, at the gate,
	A tapering turret overtops the work.
	And when his hours are numbered, and the world
	Is all his own, retiring, as he were not,
	Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art
	To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone,
	Built in an age, the mad wind’s night-work,
	The frolic architecture of the snow.
