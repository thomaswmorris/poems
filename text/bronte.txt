*** Emily Brontë (1818 - 1848)


1. FALL, LEAVES, FALL

	Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
	Lengthen night and shorten day;
	Every leaf speaks bliss to me
	Fluttering from the autumn tree.
	I shall smile when wreaths of snow
	Blossom where the rose should grow;
	I shall sing when night’s decay
	Ushers in a drearier day.



2. NO COWARD SOUL IS MINE

	No coward soul is mine
	No trembler in the world’s storm-troubled sphere
	I see Heaven’s glories shine
	And Faith shines equal arming me from Fear

	O God within my breast
	Almighty ever-present Deity
	Life, that in me hast rest,
	As I Undying Life, have power in Thee

	Vain are the thousand creeds
	That move men’s hearts, unutterably vain,
	Worthless as withered weeds
	Or idlest froth amid the boundless main

	To waken doubt in one
	Holding so fast by thy infinity,
	So surely anchored on
	The steadfast rock of Immortality.

	With wide-embracing love
	Thy spirit animates eternal years
	Pervades and broods above,
	Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates and rears

	Though earth and moon were gone
	And suns and universes ceased to be
	And Thou wert left alone
	Every Existence would exist in thee

	There is not room for Death
	Nor atom that his might could render void
	Since thou art Being and Breath
	And what thou art may never be destroyed.



3. REMEMBRANCE

	Cold in the earth—and the deep snow piled above thee,
	Far, far removed, cold in the dreary grave!
	Have I forgot, my only Love, to love thee,
	Severed at last by Time’s all-severing wave?

	Now, when alone, do my thoughts no longer hover
	Over the mountains, on that northern shore,
	Resting their wings where heath and fern-leaves cover
	Thy noble heart forever, ever more?

	Cold in the earth—and fifteen wild Decembers,
	From those brown hills, have melted into spring:
	Faithful, indeed, is the spirit that remembers
	After such years of change and suffering!

	Sweet Love of youth, forgive, if I forget thee,
	While the world’s tide is bearing me along;
	Other desires and other hopes beset me,
	Hopes which obscure, but cannot do thee wrong!

	No later light has lightened up my heaven,
	No second morn has ever shone for me;
	All my life’s bliss from thy dear life was given,
	All my life’s bliss is in the grave with thee.

	But, when the days of golden dreams had perished,
	And even Despair was powerless to destroy,
	Then did I learn how existence could be cherished,
	Strengthened, and fed without the aid of joy.

	Then did I check the tears of useless passion—
	Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine;
	Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten
	Down to that tomb already more than mine.

	And, even yet, I dare not let it languish,
	Dare not indulge in memory’s rapturous pain;
	Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish,
	How could I seek the empty world again?



4. SHALL EARTH NO MORE INSPIRE THEE

	Shall earth no more inspire thee,
	Thou lonely dreamer now?
	Since passion may not fire thee
	Shall Nature cease to bow?

	Thy mind is ever moving
	In regions dark to thee;
	Recall its useless roving--
	Come back and dwell with me.

	I know my mountain breezes
	Enchant and soothe thee still--
	I know my sunshine pleases
	Despite thy wayward will.

	When day with evening blending
	Sinks from the summer sky,
	I’ve seen thy spirit bending
	In fond idolatry.

	I’ve watched thee every hour;
	I know my mighty sway,
	I know my magic power
	To drive thy griefs away.

	Few hearts to mortals given
	On earth so wildly pine;
	Yet none would ask a heaven
	More like this earth than thine.

	Then let my winds caress thee;
	Thy comrade let me be--
	Since nought beside can bless thee,
	Return and dwell with me.



5. THE TWO CHILDREN

	Heavy hangs the raindrop
	From the burdened spray;
	Heavy broods the damp mist
	On uplands far away;

	Heavy looms the dull sky,
	Heavy rolls the sea--
	And heavy beats the young heart
	Beneath that lonely tree.

	Never has a blue streak
	Cleft the clouds since morn--
	Never has his grim Fate
	Smiled since he was born.

	Frowning on the infant,
	Shadowing childhood’s joy,
	Guardian angel knows not
	That melancholy boy.

	Day is passing swiftly
	Its sad and sombre prime;
	Youth is fast invading
	Sterner manhood’s time.

	All the flowers are praying
	For sun before they close,
	And he prays too, unknowing,
	That sunless human rose!

	Blossoms, that the west wind
	Has never wooed to blow,
	Scentless are your petals,
	Your dew as cold as snow.

	Soul, where kindred kindness
	No early promise woke,
	Barren is your beauty
	As weed upon the rock.

	Wither, Brothers, wither,
	You were vainly given--
	Earth reserves no blessing
	For the unblessed of Heaven!

	Child of Delight! with sunbright hair,
	And seablue, seadeep eyes;
	Spirit of Bliss, what brings thee here,
	Beneath these sullen skies?

	Thou shouldst live in eternal spring,
	Where endless day is never dim;
	Why, seraph, has thy erring wing
	Borne thee down to weep with him?

	“Ah, not from heaven am I descended,
	And I do not come to mingle tears;
	But sweet is day, though with shadows blended;
	And, though clouded, sweet are youthful years.

	“I, the image of light and gladness,
	Saw and pitied that mournful boy,
	And I swore to take his gloomy sadness,
	And give to him my beamy joy.

	“Heavy and dark the night is closing;
	Heavy and dark may its biding be:
	Better for all from grief reposing,
	And better for all who watch like me.

	“Guardian angel, he lacks no longer;
	Evil fortune he need not fear:
	Fate is strong, but Love is stronger;
	And more unsleeping than angel’s care.”
