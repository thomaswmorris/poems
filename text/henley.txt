*** William Ernest Henley (1849 - 1903)


1. FILL A GLASS

	Fill a glass with golden wine,
	And the while your lips are wet
	Set your perfume unto mine,
	And forget.
	Every kiss we take and give
	Leaves us less of life to live.

	Yet again! Your whim and mine
	In a happy while have met.
	All your sweets to me resign,
	Nor regret
	That we press with every breath,
	Sighed or singing, nearer death.



2. INVICTUS

	Out of the night that covers me,
	Black as the pit from pole to pole,
	I thank whatever gods may be
	For my unconquerable soul.

	In the fell clutch of circumstance
	I have not winced nor cried aloud.
	Under the bludgeonings of chance
	My head is bloody, but unbowed.

	Beyond this place of wrath and tears
	Looms but the Horror of the shade,
	And yet the menace of the years
	Finds and shall find me unafraid.

	It matters not how strait the gate,
	How charged with punishments the scroll,
	I am the master of my fate,
	I am the captain of my soul.



3. LONGING

	Between the dusk of a summer night
	And the dawn of a summer day,
	We caught at a mood as it passed in flight,
	And we bade it stoop and stay.
	And what with the dawn of night began
	With the dusk of day was done;
	For that is the way of woman and man,
	When a hazard has made them one.
	Arc upon arc, from shade to shine,
	The World went thundering free;
	And what was his errand but hers and mine--
	The lords of him, I and she?
	O, it’s die we must, but it’s live we can,
	And the marvel of earth and sun
	Is all for the joy of woman and man
	And the longing that makes them one.



4. SUICIDE

	Staring corpselike at the ceiling,
	See his harsh, unrazored features,
	Ghastly brown against the pillow,
	And his throat--so strangely bandaged!

	Lack of work and lack of victuals,
	A debauch of smuggled whisky,
	And his children in the workhouse
	Made the world so black a riddle

	That he plunged for a solution;
	And, although his knife was edgeless,
	He was sinking fast towards one,
	When they came, and found, and saved him.

	Stupid now with shame and sorrow,
	In the night I hear him sobbing.
	But sometimes he talks a little.
	He has told me all his troubles.

	In his broad face, tanned and bloodless,
	White and wild his eyeballs glisten;
	And his smile, occult and tragic,
	Yet so slavish, makes you shudder!



5. ON THE NOTHINGNESS OF THINGS

	The big teetotum twirls,
	And epochs wax and wane
	As chance subsides or swirls;
	But of the loss and gain
	The sum is always plain.
	Read on the mighty pall,
	The weed of funeral
	That covers praise and blame,
	The -isms and the -anities,
	Magnificence and shame:--
	_O Vanity of Vanities!_

	The Fates are subtile girls!
	They give us chaff for grain.
	And Time, the Thunderer, hurls,
	Like bolted death, disdain
	At all thaTheart and brain
	Conceive, or great or small,
	Upon this earthly ball.
	Would you be knight and dame?
	Or woo the sweet humanities?
	Or illustrate a name?
	_O Vanity of Vanities!_

	We sound the sea for pearls,
	Or drown them in a drain;
	We flute it with the merles,
	Or tug and sweat and strain;
	We grovel, or we reign;
	We saunter, or we brawl;
	We answer, or we call;
	We search the stars for Fame,
	Or sink her subterranities;
	The legend’s still the same:--
	_O Vanity of Vanities!_

	Here at the wine one birls,
	There some one clanks a chain.
	The flag that this man furls
	That man to float is fain.
	Pleasure gives place to pain:
	These in the kennel crawl,
	While others take the wall.
	She has a glorious aim,
	He lives for the inanities.
	What comes of every claim?
	_O Vanity of Vanities!_

	Alike are clods and earls.
	For sot, and seer, and swain,
	For emperors and for churls,
	For antidote and bane,
	There is but one refrain:
	But one for king and thrall,
	For David and for Saul,
	For fleet of foot and lame,
	For pieties and profanities,
	The picture and the frame:--
	_O Vanity of Vanities!_

	Life is a smoke that curls--
	Curls in a flickering skein,
	That winds and whisks and whirls,
	A figment thin and vain,
	Into the vast Inane.
	One end for hut and hall!
	One end for cell and stall!
	Burned in one common flame
	Are wisdoms and insanities.
	For this alone we came:--
	_O Vanity of Vanities!_


	_Envoy_

	Prince, pride must have a fall.
	What is the worth of all
	Your state’s supreme urbanities?
	Bad at the best ‘s the game.
	Well might the Sage exclaim:--
	_O Vanity of Vanities!_



6. A WINK FROM HESPER

	A wink from Hesper, falling
	Fast in the wintry sky,
	Comes through the even blue,
	Dear, like a word from you…
	Is it good-bye?

	Across the miles between us
	I send you sigh for sigh.
	Good-Night, sweet friend, good-night:
	Till life and all take flight,
	Never good-bye.
