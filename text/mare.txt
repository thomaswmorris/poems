*** Walter de la Mare (1873 - 1965)


1. ALL THAT’S PAST

	Very old are the woods;
	And the buds that break
	Out of the brier’s boughs,
	When March winds wake,
	So old with their beauty are--
	Oh, no man knows
	Through what wild centuries
	Roves back the rose.
	Very old are the brooks;
	And the rills that rise
	Where snow sleeps cold beneath
	The azure skies
	Sing such a history
	Of come and gone,
	Their every drop is as wise
	As Solomon.
	
	Very old are we men;
	Our dreams are tales
	Told in dim Eden
	By Eve’s nightingales;
	We wake and whisper awhile,
	But, the day gone by,
	Silence and sleep like fields
	Of amaranth lie.


2. ALONE

	As I mused by the hearthside,
	Puss said to me;
	“there burns the fire, man,
	and here sit we.
	
	Four walls around us
	against the cold air;
	and the latch drawn close
	to the draughty stair.
	
	A roof o’er our heads
	star-proof, moon immune,
	and a wind in the chimney
	to wail us a tune.”
	
	“What felicity!” miaowed he,
	“where none may intrude;
	just man and beast--met
	in this solitude!”
	
	“Dear God, what security,
	comfort and bliss!
	and to think, too what ages
	have brought us to this!”
	
	“You in your sheep’s’ wool coat,
	buttons of bone,
	and me in my fur-about
	on the warm hearthstone”


3. ARABIA

	Far are the shades of Arabia,
	Where the Princes ride at noon,
	’Mid the verdurous vales and thickets,
	Under the ghost of the moon;
	And so dark is that vaulted purple
	Flowers in the forest rise
	And toss into blossom ’gainst the phantom stars
	Pale in the noonday skies.
	
	Sweet is the music of Arabia
	In my heart, when out of dreams
	I still in the thin clear mirk of dawn
	Descry her gliding streams;
	Hear her strange lutes on the green banks
	Ring loud with the grief and delight
	Of the dim-silked, dark-haired Musicians
	In the brooding silence of night.
	
	They haunt me--her lutes and her forests;
	No beauty on earth I see
	But shadowed with that dream recalls
	Her loveliness to me:
	Still eyes look coldly upon me,
	Cold voices whisper and say--
	‘He is crazed with the spell of far Arabia,
	They have stolen his wits away.’


4. GOOD-BYE

	The last of last words spoken is, Good-bye--
	The last dismantled flower in the weed-grown hedge,
	The last thin rumour of a feeble bell far ringing,
	The last blind rat to spurn the mildewed rye.
	
	A hardening darkness glasses the haunted eye,
	Shines into nothing the watcher’s burnt-out candle,
	Wreathes into scentless nothing the wasting incense,
	Faints in the outer silence the hunting-cry.
	
	Love of its muted music breathes no sigh,
	Thought in her ivory tower gropes in her spinning,
	Toss on in vain the whispering trees of Eden,
	Last of all last words spoken is, Good-bye.


5. THE KEYS OF MORNING

	While at her bedroom window once,
	Learning her task for school,
	Little Louisa lonely sat
	In the morning clear and cool,
	She slanted her small bead-brown eyes
	Across the empty street,
	And saw Death softly watching her
	In the sunshine pale and sweet.
	
	His was a long lean sallow face;
	He sat with half-shut eyes,
	Like a old sailor in a ship
	Becalmed ’neath tropic skies.
	Beside him in the dust he had set
	His staff and shady hat;
	These, peeping small, Louisa saw
	Quite clearly where she sat--
	The thinness of his coal-black locks,
	His hands so long and lean
	They scarcely seemed to grasp at all
	The keys that hung between:
	Both were of gold, but one was small,
	And with this last did he
	Wag in the air, as if to say,
	“Come hither, child, to me!”
	
	Louisa laid her lesson book
	On the cold window-sill;
	And in the sleepy sunshine house
	Went softly down, until
	She stood in the half-opened door,
	And peeped. But strange to say
	Where Death just now had sunning sat
	Only a shadow lay:
	Just the tall chimney’s round-topped cowl,
	And the small sun behind,
	Had with its shadow in the dust
	Called sleepy Death to mind.
	But most she thought how strange it was
	Two keys that he should bear,
	And that, when beckoning, he should wag
	The littlest in the air.


6. THE LISTENERS

	“Is there anybody there?” said the Traveller,
	Knocking on the moonlit door;
	And his horse in the silence champed the grass
	Of the forest’s ferny floor;
	And a bird flew up out of the turret,
	Above the Traveller’s head:
	And he smote upon the door again a second time;
	“Is there anybody there?” he said.
	But no one descended to the Traveller;
	No head from the leaf-fringed sill
	Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,
	Where he stood perplexed and still.
	But only a host of phantom listeners
	That dwelt in the lone house then
	Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
	To that voice from the world of men:
	Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,
	That goes down to the empty hall,
	Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken
	By the lonely Traveller’s call.
	And he felt in his heart their strangeness,
	Their stillness answering his cry,
	While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,
	’Neath the starred and leafy sky;
	For he suddenly smote on the door, even
	Louder, and lifted his head:--
	“Tell them I came, and no one answered,
	That I kept my word,” he said.
	Never the least stir made the listeners,
	Though every word he spake
	Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house
	From the one man left awake:
	Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,
	And the sound of iron on stone,
	And how the silence surged softly backward,
	When the plunging hoofs were gone.


7. MISTLETOE

	Sitting under the mistletoe
	(Pale-green, fairy mistletoe),
	One last candle burning low,
	All the sleepy dancers gone,
	Just one candle burning on,
	Shadows lurking everywhere:
	Some one came, and kissed me there.
	
	Tired I was; my head would go
	Nodding under the mistletoe
	(Pale-green, fairy mistletoe),
	No footsteps came, no voice, but only,
	Just as I sat there, sleepy, lonely,
	Stooped in the still and shadowy air
	Lips unseen—and kissed me there.


8. MUSIC

	When music sounds, gone is the earth I know,
	And all her lovely things even lovelier grow;
	Her flowers in vision flame, her forest trees
	Lift burdened branches, stilled with ecstasies.
	
	When music sounds, out of the water rise
	Naiads whose beauty dims my waking eyes,
	Rapt in strange dreams burns each enchanted face,
	With solemn echoing stirs their dwelling-place.
	
	When music sounds, all that I was I am
	Ere to this haunt of brooding dust I came;
	And from Time’s woods break into distant song
	The swift-winged hours, as I hasten along.


9. NOVEMBER

	There is wind where the rose was,
	Cold rain where sweet grass was,
	And clouds like sheep
	Stream o’er the steep
	Grey skies where the lark was.
	
	Nought warm where your hand was,
	Nought gold where your hair was,
	But phantom, forlorn,
	Beneath the thorn,
	Your ghost where your face was.
	
	Cold wind where your voice was,
	Tears, tears where my heart was,
	And ever with me,
	Child, ever with me,
	Silence where hope was.


10. WHY?

	Ever, ever
	Stir and shiver
	The reeds and rushes
	By the river:
	Ever, ever,
	As if in dream,
	The lone moon’s silver
	Sleeks the stream.
	What old sorrow,
	What lost love,
	Moon, reeds, rushes,
	Dream you of?
