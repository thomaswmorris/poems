*** Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807 - 1882)


1. THE DAY IS DONE

	The day is done, and the darkness
	__Falls from the wings of Night,
	As a feather is wafted downward
	__From an eagle in his flight.
	I see the lights of the village
	__Gleam through the rain and the mist,
	And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me
	__That my soul cannot resist:
	A feeling of sadness and longing,
	__That is not akin to pain,
	And resembles sorrow only
	__As the mist resembles the rain.
	Come, read to me some poem,
	__Some simple and heartfelt lay,
	That shall soothe this restless feeling,
	__And banish the thoughts of day.
	Not from the grand old masters,
	__Not from the bards sublime,
	Whose distant footsteps echo
	__Through the corridors of Time.
	For, like strains of martial music,
	__Their mighty thoughts suggest
	Life’s endless toil and endeavor;
	__And to-night I long for rest.
	Read from some humbler poet,
	__Whose songs gushed from his heart,
	As showers from the clouds of summer,
	__Or tears from the eyelids start;
	Who, through long days of labor,
	__And nights devoid of ease,
	Still heard in his soul the music
	__Of wonderful melodies.
	Such songs have power to quiet
	__The restless pulse of care,
	And come like the benediction
	__That follows after prayer.
	Then read from the treasured volume
	__The poem of thy choice,
	And lend to the rhyme of the poet
	__The beauty of thy voice.
	And the night shall be filled with music
	__And the cares, that infest the day,
	Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs,
	__And as silently steal away.



2. THE LADDER OF ST. AUGUSTINE

	Saint Augustine! well hast thou said,
	__That of our vices we can frame
	A ladder, if we will but tread
	__Beneath our feet each deed of shame!
	All common things, each day’s events,
	__That with the hour begin and end,
	Our pleasures and our discontents,
	__Are rounds by which we may ascend.
	The low desire, the base design,
	__That makes another’s virtues less;
	The revel of the ruddy wine,
	__And all occasions of excess;
	The longing for ignoble things;
	__The strife for triumph more than truth;
	The hardening of the heart, that brings
	__Irreverence for the dreams of youth;
	All thoughts of ill; all evil deeds,
	__That have their root in thoughts of ill;
	Whatever hinders or impedes
	__The action of the nobler will;—
	All these must first be trampled down
	__Beneath our feet, if we would gain
	In the bright fields of fair renown
	__The right of eminent domain.
	We have not wings, we cannot soar;
	__But we have feet to scale and climb
	By slow degrees, by more and more,
	__The cloudy summits of our time.
	The mighty pyramids of stone
	__That wedge-like cleave the desert airs,
	When nearer seen, and better known,
	__Are but gigantic flights of stairs.
	The distant mountains, that uprear
	__Their solid bastions to the skies,
	Are crossed by pathways, that appear
	__As we to higher levels rise.
	The heights by great men reached and kept
	__Were not attained by sudden flight,
	But they, while their companions slept,
	__Were toiling upward in the night.
	Standing on what too long we bore
	__With shoulders bent and downcast eyes,
	We may discern—unseen before—
	__A path to higher destinies.
	Nor deem the irrevocable Past,
	__As wholly wasted, wholly vain,
	If, rising on its wrecks, at last
	__To something nobler we attain.



3. A PSALM OF LIFE

	Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
	Life is but an empty dream!
	For the soul is dead that slumbers,
	And things are not what they seem.

	Life is real! Life is earnest!
	And the grave is not its goal;
	Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
	Was not spoken of the soul.

	Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
	Is our destined end or way;
	But to act, that each to-morrow
	Find us farther than to-day.

	Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
	And our hearts, though stout and brave,
	Still, like muffled drums, are beating
	Funeral marches to the grave.

	In the world’s broad field of battle,
	In the bivouac of Life,
	Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
	Be a hero in the strife!

	Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!
	Let the dead Past bury its dead!
	Act,—act in the living Present!
	Heart within, and God o’erhead!

	Lives of great men all remind us
	We can make our lives sublime,
	And, departing, leave behind us
	Footprints on the sands of time;

	Footprints, that perhaps another,
	Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,
	A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
	Seeing, shall take heart again.

	Let us, then, be up and doing,
	With a heart for any fate;
	Still achieving, still pursuing,
	Learn to labor and to wait.



4. THE RAINY DAY

	The day is cold, and dark, and dreary;
	It rains, and the wind is never weary;
	The vine still clings to the mouldering wall,
	But at every gust the dead leaves fall,
	And the day is dark and dreary.

	My life is cold, and dark, and dreary;
	It rains, and the wind is never weary;
	My thoughts still cling to the mouldering Past,
	But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,
	And the days are dark and dreary.

	Be still, sad heart! and cease repining;
	Behind the clouds is the sun still shining;
	Thy fate is the common fate of all,
	Into each life some rain must fall,
	Some days must be dark and dreary.



5. THE REAPER AND THE FLOWERS

	There is a Reaper, whose name is Death,
	__And, with his sickle keen,
	He reaps the bearded grain at a breath,
	__And the flowers that grow between.

	“Shall I have naught that is fair?” saith he;
	__“Have naught but the bearded grain?
	Though the breath of these flowers is sweet to me,
	__I will give them all back again.”

	He gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes,
	__He kissed their drooping leaves;
	It was for the Lord of Paradise
	__He bound them in his sheaves.

	“My Lord has need of these flowerets gay,”
	__The Reaper said, and smiled;
	“Dear tokens of the earth are they,
	__Where He was once a child.

	“They shall all bloom in fields of light,
	__Transplanted by my care,
	And saints, upon their garments white,
	__These sacred blossoms wear.”

	And the mother gave, in tears and pain,
	__The flowers she most did love;
	She knew she should find them all again
	__In the fields of light above.

	Oh, not in cruelty, not in wrath,
	__The Reaper came that day;
	‘T was an angel visited the green earth,
	__And took the flowers away.
