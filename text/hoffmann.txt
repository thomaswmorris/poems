*** Daniel Hoffmann (1923 - 2013)


1. THE CENTER OF ATTENTION

	As grit swirls in the wind the word spreads. 
	On pavements approaching the bridge a crowd 
	Springs up like mushrooms. 
	They are hushed at first, intently 
	
	Looking. At the top of the pylon 
	The target of their gaze leans toward them. 
	The sky sobs 
	With the sirens of disaster crews 
	
	Careening toward the crowd with nets, 
	Ladders, resuscitation gear, their First 
	Aid attendants antiseptic in white duck. 
	The police, strapped into their holsters, 
	
	Exert themselves in crowd-control.They can’t 
	Control the situation. 
	Atop the pylon there’s a man who threatens 
	Violence. He shouts, I’m gonna jump-- 
	
	And from the river of upturned faces 
	--Construction workers pausing in their construction work, 
	Shoppers diverted from their shopping, 
	The idlers relishing this diversion 
	
	In the vacuity of their day--arises 
	A chorus of cries--Jump! 
	Jump! and No-- 
	Come down! Come down! Maybe, if he can hear them, 
	
	They seem to be saying Jump down! The truth is, 
	The crowd cannot make up its mind. 
	This is a tough decision. The man beside me 
	Reaches into his lunchbox and lets him have it. 
	
	Jump! before he bites his sandwich, 
	While next to him a young blonde clutches 
	Her handbag to her breasts and moans 
	Don’t Don’t Don’t so very softly 
	
	You’d think she was afraid of being heard. 
	The will of the people is divided. 
	Up there he hasn’t made his mind up either. 
	He has climbed and climbed on spikes imbedded in the pylon 
	
	To get where he has arrived at. 
	Is he sure now that this is where he was going? 
	He looks down one way into the river. 
	He looks down the other way into the people. 
	
	He seems to be looking for something 
	Or for somebody in particular. 
	Is there anyone here who is that person 
	Or can give him what it is that he needs? 
	
	From the back of a firetruck a ladder teeters. 
	Inching along, up up up up up, a policeman 
	Holds on with one hand, sliding it on ahead of him. 
	In the other, outstretched, a pack of cigarettes. 
	
	Soon the man will decide between 
	The creature comfort of one more smoke 
	And surcease from being a creature. 
	Meanwhile the crowd calls Jump! and calls Come down! 
	
	Now, his cassock billowing in the bulges of Death’s black flag, 
	A priest creeps up the ladder too 
	What will the priest and the policeman together 
	Persuade the man to do? 
	
	He has turned his back to them. 
	He has turned away from everyone. 
	His solitariness is nearly complete. 
	He is alone with his decision. 
	
	No one on the ground or halfway into the sky can know 
	The hugeness of the emptiness that surrounds him. 
	All of his senses are orphans. 
	His ribs are cold andirons. 
	
	Does he regret his rejection of furtive pills, 
	Of closet noose or engine idling in closed garage? 
	A body will plummet through shrieking air, 
	The audience dumb with horror, the spattered street . . . 
	
	The world he has left is as small as toys at his feet. 
	Where he stands, though nearer the sun, the wind is chill. 
	He clutches his arms--a caress, or is he trying 
	Merely to warm himself with his arms? 
	
	The people below, their necks are beginning to ache. 
	They are getting impatient for this diversion 
	To come to some conclusion. The priest 
	Inches further narrowly up the ladder. 
	
	The center of everybody’s attention 
	For some reason has lit up a butt. He sits down. 
	He looks down on the people gathered, and sprinkles 
	Some of his ashes upon them. 
	
	Before he is halfway down 
	The crowd is half-dispersed. 
	It was his aloneness that clutched them together. 
	They were spellbound by his despair 
	
	And now each rung brings him nearer, 
	Nearer to their condition 
	Which is not sufficiently interesting 
	To detain them from business or idleness either, 
	
	Or is too close to a despair 
	They do not dare 
	Exhibit before a crowd 
	Or admit to themselves they share. 
	
	Now the police are taking notes 
	On clipboards, filling the forms. 
	He looks round as though searching for what he came down for. 
	Traffic flows over the bridge.


2. STONE

	Ever since the first fires
	Cooled and colors went out of the air
	And on my fanks water sizzled and seethed
	And collected in warm pools in my pockets
	I have not changed. Cold came,
	Prying its levers of ice in my veins,
	Roots thrust into my pores and split them,
	The sun roared overhead streaming
	Its heat on my hard glazed skin
	Trying each summer all summer
	To roast me to ember. Rain
	Came again, and again and again
	Lacing and creasing my forehead with furrows
	And rivers. Later it came as snow
	Cracking and brittle, as though
	I would turn brittle and crack.
	Well, waves have broken me into pieces,
	Pounded my pieces against one another--
	Some of my flesh is pebbles, sand.
	I have been here since before the arrival
	Of the creatures who have come and are most of them
	gone now.
	But nothing can change me. Split me apart,
	Test me by fire, grind me down
	--I’m still what I was, with my heart of stone.


3. YOURS

	I am yours as the summer air at evening is 
	Possessed by the scent of linden blossoms, 
	
	As the snowcap gleams with light 
	Lent it by the brimming moon. 
	
	Without you I’d be an unleafed tree 
	Blasted in a bleakness with no Spring. 
	
	Your love is the weather of my being. 
	What is an island without the sea?
