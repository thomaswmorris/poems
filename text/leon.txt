*** Luis de León (1527 - 1591)


1. THE LIFE REMOVED

	    How tranquil is the life
	Of him who, shunning the vain world’s uproar,
	May follow, free from strife,
	The hidden path, of yore
	Chosen by the few who conned true wisdom’s lore!
	
	    For he, with thoughts aloof,
	By proud men’s great estate is not oppressed.
	Nor marvels at the roof
	Of gold, built to attest
	The Moor’s skill, that on jasper pillars rests.
	
	    He heeds not though fame raise
	His name afar on wings of rumour flung,
	He cares not for the praise
	Of cunning flatterer’s tongue,
	Nor for what truth sincere would leave unsung.
	
	    What boots it my content
	That the vain voice of fame should favour me,
	If in its service spent
	I find myself to be
	Vexed by dull care and gnawing misery?
	
	    O hill, O stream, O field,
	O solitary refuge of delight,
	Since my bark now must yield
	To storm, your solace bright
	I seek and flee this sea’s tempestuous might.
	
	    Sleep broken by no fear
	Be mine, and a day clear, serene, and free,
	Shunning the look severe,
	Lofty exceedingly,
	Of him whom gold exalts or ancestry.
	
	    Me may the birds awake
	With their sweet, unpremeditated song,
	And those dark cares forsake
	That e’er to him belong
	Who lives not in his independence strong!
	
	    I to myself would live,
	To enjoy the blessings that to Heaven I owe,
	Alone, contemplative,
	And freely love forgo,
	Nor hope, fear, hatred, jealousy e’er know.
	
	    Upon the bare hillside
	An orchard I have made with my own hand,
	That in the sweet Springtide
	All in fair flower doth stand
	And promise sure of fruit shows through the land.
	
	    And, as though swift it strove
	To see and to increase that loveliness,
	From the clear ridge above
	A stream pure, weariless
	Hurrying to reach that ground doth onward press;
	
	    And straightway in repose
	Its course it winds there tree and tree between,
	And ever as it goes
	The earth decks with new green
	And with gay wealth of flowers spreads the scene.
	
	    The air in gentle breeze
	A myriad scents for my delight distils,
	It moves among the trees
	With a soft sound that fills
	The mind, and thought of gold or scepter kills.
	
	    Treasure and gold be theirs
	Who to a frail bark would entrust their life:
	I envy not the cares
	Of those whose fears are rife
	When the north wind with south wind is at strife.
	
	    In the storm’s strain the mast
	Groans, and clear day is turned to eyeless night,
	While to the skies aghast
	Rise wild cries of affright
	And they enrich the sea in their despite.
	
	    But me may still suffice,
	Rich only in meek peace, a humble fare;
	And the wrought artifice
	Be his of gold plate rare
	Who dreads not o’er the raging sea to fare.
	
	    And while in misery
	Others are pledged to fierce ambition’s throng,
	Afire insatiably
	For power that stays not long,
	May I in pleasant shade recite my song;
	
	    Yea, lying in the shade,
	My brow with bay and ivy immortal crowned,
	My ear attentive made
	To the soft, tuneful sound
	Of zither touched by fingers’ skill profound.
