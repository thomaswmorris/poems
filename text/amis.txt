*** Kingsley Amis (1922 - 1995)


1. SOMETHING NASTY IN THE BOOKSHOP

	Between the Gardening and the Cookery
	Comes the brief Poetry shelf;
	By the Nonesuch Donne, a thin anthology
	Offers itself.
	
	Critical, and with nothing else to do,
	I scan the Contents page,
	Relieved to find the names are mostly new;
	No one my age.
	
	Like all strangers, they divide by sex:
	Landscape Near Parma
	Interests a man, so does The Double Vortex,
	So does Rilke and Buddha.
	
	“I travel, you see”, “I think” and “I can read”
	These titles seem to say;
	But I Remember You, Love is my Creed,
	Poem for J.,
	
	The ladies’ choice, discountenance my patter
	For several seconds;
	From somewhere in this (as in any) matter
	A moral beckons.
	
	Should poets bicycle-pump the human heart
	Or squash it flat?
	Man’s love is of man’s life a thing apart;
	Girls aren’t like that.
	
	We men have got love well weighed up; our stuff
	Can get by without it.
	Women don’t seem to think that’s good enough;
	They write about it.
	
	And the awful way their poems lay them open
	Just doesn’t strike them.
	Women are really much nicer than men:
	No wonder we like them.
	
	Deciding this, we can forget those times
	We stayed up half the night
	Chock-full of love, crammed with bright thoughts, names, rhymes,
	And couldn’t write.



2. THINGS TELL LESS AND LESS

	Things tell less and less: 
	The news impersonal 
	And from afar; no book 
	Worth wrenching off the shelf. 
	Liquor brings dizziness 
	And food discomfort; all 
	Music sounds thin and tired, 
	And what picture could earn a look? 
	The self drowses in the self 
	Beyond hope of a visitor. 
	Desire and those desired 
	Fade, and no matter: 
	Memories in decay 
	Annihilate the day. 
	There once was an answer: 
	Up at the stroke of seven, 
	A turn round the garden 
	(Breathing deep and slow), 
	Then work, never mind what, 
	How small, provided that 
	It serves another’s good 
	But once is long ago 
	And, tell me, how could 
	Such an answer be less than wrong, 
	Be right all along? 
	Vain echoes, desist.



3. WASTED

	That cold winter evening
	The fire would not draw,
	And the whole family hung
	Over the dismal grate
	Where rain-soaked logs
	Bubbled, hissed and steamed.
	Then, when the others had gone
	Up to their chilly beds,
	And I was ready to go,
	The wood began to flame
	In clear rose and violet,
	Heating the small hearth.
	
	Why should that memory cling
	Now the children are all grown up,
	And the house--a different house--
	Is warm at any season?
