*** Edith Sitwell (1887 - 1964)


1. AT THE FAIR

	I. _Springing Jack_
	
	Green wooden leaves clap light away,
	Severely practical, as they
	
	Shelter the children candy-pale,
	The chestnut-candles flicker, fail . . .
	
	The showman’s face is cubed clear as
	The shapes reflected in a glass
	
	Of water--(glog, glut, a ghost’s speech
	Fumbling for space from each to each).
	
	The fusty showman fumbles, must 
	Fit in a particle of dust
	
	The universe, for fear it gain
	Its freedom from my cube of brain.
	
	Yet dust bears seeds that grow to grace
	Behind my crude-striped wooden face
	
	As I, a puppet tinsel-pink
	Leap on my springs, learn how to think--
	
	Till like the trembling golden stalk
	Of some long-petalled star, I walk
	
	Through the dark heavens, and the dew
	Falls on my eyes and sense thrills through.
	
	
	II. _The Ape Watches “Aunt Sally”_
	
	The apples are an angel’s meat;
	The shining dark leaves make clear sweet
	
	The juice; green wooden fruits alway
	Fall on these flowers as white as day--
	
	(Clear angel-face on hairy stalk:
	Soul grown from flesh, an ape’s young talk!)
	
	And in this green and lovely ground
	The Fair, world-like, turns round and round
	
	And bumpkins throw their pence to shed
	Aunt Sally’s wooden clear-striped head.--
	
	I do not care if men should throw
	Round sun and moon to make me go--
	
	As bright as gold and silver pence . . .
	They cannot drive their black shade hence!



2. AUBADE

	JANE, Jane, 
	Tall as a crane, 
	The morning light creaks down again;
	
	Comb your cockscomb-ragged hair, 
	Jane, Jane, come down the stair.
	
	Each dull blunt wooden stalactite 
	Of rain creaks, hardened by the light,
	
	Sounding like an overtone 
	From some lonely world unknown.
	
	But the creaking empty light 
	Will never harden into sight,
	
	Will never penetrate your brain 
	With overtones like the blunt rain.
	
	The light would show (if it could harden) 
	Eternities of kitchen garden,
	
	Cockscomb flowers that none will pluck, 
	And wooden flowers that ’gin to cluck.
	
	In the kitchen you must light 
	Flames as staring, red and white,
	
	As carrots or as turnips shining 
	Where the cold dawn light lies whining.
	
	Cockscomb hair on the cold wind 
	Hangs limp, turns the milk’s weak mind . . .
	
	Jane, Jane, 
	Tall as a crane, 
	The morning light creaks down again!



3. BELLS OF GRAY CRYSTAL

	Bells of gray crystal
	Break on each bough--
	The swans’ breath will mist all
	The cold airs now.
	Like tall pagodas
	Two people go,
	Trail their long codas
	Of talk through the snow.
	Lonely are these
	And lonely and I . . .
	The clouds, gray Chinese geese
	Sleek through the sky.



4. BY CANDLELIGHT

	Houses red as flower of bean,
	Flickering leaves and shadows lean!
	Pantalone, like a parrot,
	Sat and grumbled in the garret--
	Sat and growled and grumbled till 
	Moon upon the window-sill
	Like a red geranium
	Scented his bald cranium.
	Said Brighella, meaning well:
	“Pack your box and--go to Hell!
	Heat will cure your rheumatism!” . . .
	Silence crowned this optimism--
	Not a sound and not a wail:
	But the fire (lush leafy vales)
	Watched the angry feathers fly.
	Pantalone ’gan to cry--
	Could not, would not, pack his box!
	Shadows (curtseying hens and cocks)
	Pecking in the attic gloom
	Tried to smother his tail-plume . . .
	Till a cockscomb candle-flame
	Crowing loudly, died: Dawn came.



5. BY THE LAKE

	ACROSS the flat and the pastel snow
	Two people go . . . . ‘And do you remember
	When last we wandered this shore?’ . . . ‘Ah no!
	For it is cold-hearted December.’
	‘Dead, the leaves that like asses’s ears hung on the trees
	When last we wandered and squandered joy here;
	Now Midas your husband will listen for these
	Whispers--these tears for joy’s bier.’
	And as they walk, they seem tall pagodas;
	And all the ropes let down from the cloud
	Ring the hard cold bell-buds upon the trees--codas
	Of overtones, ecstasies, grown for love’s shroud



6. CAME THE GREAT POPINJAY

	CAME the great Popinjay 
	Smelling his nosegay: 
	In cages like grots 
	The birds sang gavottes. 
	‘Herodiade’s flea 
	Was named sweet Amanda, 
	She danced like a lady 
	From here to Uganda. 
	Oh, what a dance was there! 
	Long-haired, the candle 
	Salome-like tossed her hair 
	To a dance tune by Handel.’ . . . 
	Dance they still? Then came 
	Courtier Death, 
	Blew out the candle flame 
	With civet breath.



7. THE DANCERS

	The floors are slippery with blood:
	The world gyrates too. God is good
	That while His wind blows out the light
	For those who hourly die for is--
	We still can dance each night.
	
	The music has grown numb with death--
	But we will suck their dying breath,
	The whispered name they breathed to chance,
	To swell our music, make it loud
	That we may dance,--may dance.
	
	We are the dull blind carrion-fly
	That dance and batten. Though God die
	Mad from the horror of the light--
	The light is mad, too, flecked with blood,--
	We dance, we dance, each night.



8. EVENTAIL

	LOVELY Semiramis 
	Closes her slanting eyes: 
	Dead is she long ago. 
	From her fan, sliding slow, 
	Parrot-bright fire’s feathers, 
	Gilded as June weathers, 
	Plumes bright and shrill as grass 
	Twinkle down; as they pass 
	Through the green glooms in Hell 
	Fruits with a tuneful smell, 
	Grapes like an emerald rain, 
	Where the full moon has lain, 
	Greengages bright as grass, 
	Melons as cold as glass, 
	Piled on each gilded booth, 
	Feel their cheeks growing smooth. 
	Apes in plumed head-dresses 
	Whence the bright heat hisses,--
	Nubian faces, sly 
	Pursing mouth, slanting eye, 
	Feel the Arabian 
	Winds floating from the fan.



9. FOUR IN THE MORNING

	Cried the navy-blue ghost
	Of Mr. Belaker
	The allegro Negro cocktail-shaker,
	“Why did the cock crow,
	Why am I lost,
	Down the endless road to Infinity toss’d?
	The tropical leaves are whispering white
	As water; I race the wind in my flight.
	The white lace houses are carried away
	By the tide; far out they float and sway.
	White is the nursemaid on the parade.
	Is she real, as she flirts with me unafraid?
	I raced through the leaves as white as water . . . 
	Ghostly, flowed over the nursemaid, caught her,
	Left her . . . edging the far-off sand
	Is the foam of the sirens’ Metropole and Grand;
	And along the parade I am blown and lost,
	Down the endless road to Infinity toss’d.
	The guinea-fowl-plumaged houses sleep . . . 
	On one, I saw the lone grass weep,
	Where only the whimpering greyhound wind
	Chased me, raced me, for what it could find.”
	And there in the black and furry boughs
	How slowly, coldly, old Time grows,
	Where the pigeons smelling of gingerbread,
	And the spectacled owls so deeply read,
	And the sweet ring-doves of curded milk
	Watch the Infanta’s gown of silk
	In the ghost-room tall where the governante
	Gesticulates lente and walks andante.
	“Madam, Princesses must be obedient;
	For a medicine now becomes expedient--
	Of five ingredients--a diapente,”
	Said the governante, fading lente . . . 
	In at the window then looked he,
	The navy-blue ghost of Mr. Belaker,
	The allegro Negro cocktail-shaker--
	And his flattened face like the moon saw she--
	Rhinoceros-black (a flowing sea!).



10. HEART AND MIND

	SAID the Lion to the Lioness-‘When you are amber dust,-
	No more a raging fire like the heat of the Sun
	(No liking but all lust)-
	Remember still the flowering of the amber blood and bone,
	The rippling of bright muscles like a sea,
	Remember the rose-prickles of bright paws
	Though the fire of that sun the heart and the moon-cold bone are one.’
	
	Said the Skeleton lying upon the sands of Time-
	‘The great gold planet that is the mourning heat of the Sun
	Is greater than all gold, more powerful
	Than the tawny body of a Lion that fire consumes
	Like all that grows or leaps...so is the heart
	
	More powerful than all dust. Once I was Hercules
	Or Samson, strong as the pillars of the seas:
	But the flames of the heart consumed me, and the mind
	Is but a foolish wind.’
	
	Said the Sun to the Moon-‘When you are but a lonely white crone,
	And I, a dead King in my golden armour somewhere in a dark wood,
	Remember only this of our hopeless love
	That never till Time is done
	Will the fire of the heart and the fire of the mind be one.’



11. THE LADY WITH THE SEWING-MACHINE

	Across the fields as green as spinach,
	Cropped as close as Time to Greenwich,
	
	Stands a high house; if at all,
	Spring comes like a Paisley shawl--
	
	Patternings meticulous
	And youthfully ridiculous.
	
	In each room the yellow sun
	Shakes like a canary, run
	
	On run, roulade, and watery trill--
	Yellow, meaningless, and shrill.
	
	Face as white as any clock’s,
	Cased in parsley-dark curled locks--
	
	All day long you sit and sew,
	Stitch life down for fear it grow,
	
	Stitch life down for fear we guess
	At the hidden ugliness.
	
	Dusty voice that throbs with heat,
	Hoping with your steel-thin beat
	
	To put stitches in my mind,
	Make it tidy, make it kind,
	
	You shall not: I’ll keep it free
	Though you turn earth, sky and sea
	
	To a patchwork quilt to keep
	Your mind snug and warm in sleep!



12. STILL FALLS THE RAIN

	Still falls the Rain--
	Dark as the world of man, black as our loss--
	Blind as the nineteen hundred and forty nails
	Upon the Cross.
	
	Still falls the Rain
	With a sound like the pulse of the heart that is changed to the hammer-beat
	In the Potter’s Field, and the sound of the impious feet
	
	On the Tomb:
	Still falls the Rain
	
	In the Field of Blood where the small hopes breed and the human brain
	Nurtures its greed, that worm with the brow of Cain.
	
	Still falls the Rain
	At the feet of the Starved Man hung upon the Cross.
	Christ that each day, each night, nails there, have mercy on us--
	On Dives and on Lazarus:
	Under the Rain the sore and the gold are as one.
	
	Still falls the Rain--
	Still falls the Blood from the Starved Man’s wounded Side:
	He bears in His Heart all wounds,--those of the light that died,
	The last faint spark
	In the self-murdered heart, the wounds of the sad uncomprehending dark,
	The wounds of the baited bear--
	The blind and weeping bear whom the keepers beat
	On his helpless flesh . . . the tears of the hunted hare.
	
	Still falls the Rain--
	Then-- O Ile leape up to my God: who pulles me doune--
	See, see where Christ’s blood streames in the firmament:
	It flows from the Brow we nailed upon the tree
	
	Deep to the dying, to the thirsting heart
	That holds the fires of the world,--dark-smirched with pain
	As Caesar’s laurel crown.
	
	Then sounds the voice of One who like the heart of man
	Was once a child who among beasts has lain--
	“Still do I love, still shed my innocent light, my Blood, for thee.”



13. TOURNEZ, TOURNEZ, BON CHEVAUX DE BOIS

	Turn, turn again,
	Ape’s blood in each vein!
	The people that pass
	Seem castles of glass,
	The old and the good
	Giraffes of the blue wood,
	The soldier, the nurse,
	Wooden-face and a curse,
	Are shadowed with plumage
	Like birds, by the gloomage.
	Blond hair like a clown’s 
	The music floats--drowns
	The creaking of ropes,
	The breaking of hopes,
	The wheezing, the old,
	Like harmoniums scold;
	Go to Babylon, Rome,
	The brain-cells called home,
	The grave, new Jerusalem--
	Wrinkled Methusalem!
	From our floating hair 
	Derived the first fair
	And queer inspiration
	Of music, the nation
	Of bright-plumed trees
	And harpy-shrill breeze . . .
	
	Turn, turn again,
	Ape’s blood in each vein!



14. WHAT THE GOOSE-GIRL SAID ABOUT THE DEAN

	Turn again, turn again,
	Goose Clothilda, Goosie Jane.
	
	Bright wooden waves of people creak
	From houses built with coloured straws
	Of heat; Dean Pasppus’ long nose snores
	Harsh as a hautbois, marshy-weak.
	
	The wooden waves of people creak
	Through the fields all water-sleek.
	
	And in among the straws of light
	Those bumpkin hautbois-sounds take flight.
	
	Whence he lies snoring like the moon
	Clownish-white all afternoon.
	
	Beneath the trees’ arsenical
	Sharp woodwind tunes; heretical--
	
	Blown like the wind’s mane
	(Creaking woodenly again).
	
	His wandering thoughts escape like geese
	Till he, their gooseherd, sets up chase,
	And clouds of wool join the bright race
	For scattered old simplicities.



15. WHEN COLD DECEMBER

	WHEN cold December
	Froze to grisamber
	The jangling bells on the sweet rose-trees--
	Then fading slow
	And furred is the snow
	As the almond’s sweet husk--
	And smelling like musk.
	The snow amygdaline
	Under the eglantine
	Where the bristling stars shine
	Like a gilt porcupine--
	The snow confesses
	The little Princesses
	On their small chioppines
	Dance under the orpines.
	See the casuistries
	Of their slant fluttering eyes--
	Gilt as the zodiac
	(Dancing Herodiac).
	Only the snow slides
	Like gilded myrrh--
	From the rose-branches--hides
	Rose-roots that stir.
