*** John Ashbery (1927 - 2017)


1. ALCOVE

	Is it possible that spring could be
	once more approaching? We forget each time
	what a mindless business it is, porous like sleep,
	adrift on the horizon, refusing to take sides, “mugwump
	of the final hour,“ lest an agenda--horrors!--be imputed to it,
	and the whole point of its being spring collapse
	like a hole dug in sand. It’s breathy, though,
	you have to say that for it.
	And should further seasons coagulate
	into years, like spilled, dried paint, why,
	who’s to say we weren’t provident? We indeed
	looked out for others as though they mattered, and they,
	catching the spirit, came home with us, spent the night
	in an alcove from which their breathing could be heard clearly.
	But it’s not over yet. Terrible incidents happen
	daily. That’s how we get around obstacles.


2. AND ‘UT PICTURA POESIS’ IS HER NAME

	You can’t say it that way any more.   
	Bothered about beauty you have to   
	Come out into the open, into a clearing,
	And rest. Certainly whatever funny happens to you
	Is OK. To demand more than this would be strange
	Of you, you who have so many lovers,   
	People who look up to you and are willing   
	To do things for you, but you think
	It’s not right, that if they really knew you . . .
	So much for self-analysis. Now,
	About what to put in your poem-painting:   
	Flowers are always nice, particularly delphinium.   
	Names of boys you once knew and their sleds,   
	Skyrockets are good--do they still exist?
	There are a lot of other things of the same quality   
	As those I’ve mentioned. Now one must
	Find a few important words, and a lot of low-keyed,
	Dull-sounding ones. She approached me
	About buying her desk. Suddenly the street was   
	Bananas and the clangor of Japanese instruments.   
	Humdrum testaments were scattered around. His head
	Locked into mine. We were a seesaw. Something   
	Ought to be written about how this affects   
	You when you write poetry:
	The extreme austerity of an almost empty mind
	Colliding with the lush, Rousseau-like foliage of its desire to communicate   
	Something between breaths, if only for the sake   
	Of others and their desire to understand you and desert you
	For other centers of communication, so that understanding
	May begin, and in doing so be undone.


3. AS YOU CAME FROM THE HOLY LAND

	of western New York state
	were the graves all right in their bushings
	was there a note of panic in the late August air
	because the old man had peed in his pants again
	was there turning away from the late afternoon glare
	as though it too could be wished away
	was any of this present
	and how could this be
	the magic solution to what you are in now
	whatever has held you motionless
	like this so long through the dark season
	until now the women come out in navy blue
	and the worms come out of the compost to die
	it is the end of any season
	
	you reading there so accurately
	sitting not wanting to be disturbed
	as you came from that holy land
	what other signs of earth’s dependency were upon you
	what fixed sign at the crossroads
	what lethargy in the avenues
	where all is said in a whisper
	what tone of voice among the hedges
	what tone under the apple trees
	the numbered land stretches away
	and your house is built in tomorrow
	but surely not before the examination
	of what is right and will befall
	not before the census
	and the writing down of names
	
	remember you are free to wander away
	as from other times other scenes that were taking place
	the history of someone who came too late
	the time is ripe now and the adage
	is hatching as the seasons change and tremble
	it is finally as though that thing of monstrous interest
	were happening in the sky
	but the sun is setting and prevents you from seeing it
	
	out of night the token emerges
	its leaves like birds alighting all at once under a tree
	taken up and shaken again
	put down in weak rage
	knowing as the brain does it can never come about
	not here not yesterday in the past
	only in the gap of today filling itself
	as emptiness is distributed
	in the idea of what time it is
	when that time is already past


4. BLUEPRINTS AND OTHERS

	The man across the street seems happy,
	or pleased. Sometimes a porter evades the grounds.
	After you play a lot with the military
	you are my own best customer.
	
	I’ve done five of that.
	Make my halloween. Ask me not to say it.
	The old man wants to see you--_now_.
	That’s all right, but find your own.
	Do you want to stop using these?
	
	Last winning people told me to sit on the urinal.
	Do not put on others what you can put on yourself.
	_How to be in the city my loved one._
	Men in underwear . . . A biography field
	like where we live in the mountains,
	
	a falling. Yes I know you have.
	Troves of merchandise, you know, “boomer buzz.”
	Hillbilly sculptures of the outside.
	(They won’t see anybody.)


5. BOUNDARY ISSUES

	Here in life, they would understand.   
	How could it be otherwise? We had groped too,   
	unwise, till the margin began to give way,   
	at which point all was sullen, or lost, or both.   
	
	Now it was time, and there was nothing for it.   
	
	We had a good meal, I and my friend,   
	slurping from the milk pail, grabbing at newer vegetables.   
	Yet life was a desert. Come home, in good faith.   
	You can still decide to. But it wanted warmth.   
	Otherwise ruse and subtlety would become impossible   
	in the few years or hours left to us. “Yes, but . . .”   
	The iconic beggars shuffled off   too. I told you,   
	once a breach emerges it will become a chasm   
	before anyone’s had a chance to waver. A dispute   
	on the far side of town erupts into a war   
	in no time at all, and ends as abruptly. The tendency to heal   
	sweeps all before it, into the arroyo, the mine shaft,   
	into whatever pocket you were contemplating. And the truly lost   
	make up for it. It’s always us that has to pay.   
	
	I have a suggestion to make: draw the sting out   
	as probingly as you please. Plaster the windows over   
	with wood pulp against the noon gloom proposing its enigmas,   
	its elixirs. Banish truth-telling. 
	That’s the whole point, as I understand it.   
	Each new investigation rebuilds the urgency,   
	like a sand rampart. And further reflection undermines it,   
	causing its eventual collapse. We could see all that   
	from a distance, as on a curving abacus, in urgency mode   
	from day one, but by then dispatches hardly mattered.   
	It was camaraderie, or something like it, that did,   
	poring over us like we were papyri, hoping to find one   
	correct attitude sketched on the gaslit air, night’s friendly takeover.


6. BUNCH OF STUFF

	To all events I squirted you
	knowing this not to be this came to pass
	when we were out and it looked good.
	Why wouldn’t you want a fresh piece
	of outlook to stand in down the years?
	See, your house, a former human energy construction,
	crashed with us for a few days in May
	and sure enough, the polar inscape
	brought about some easier poems,
	which I guessed was a good thing. At least
	some of us were relaxed, Steamboat Bill included.
	
	He didn’t drink nothing.
	It was one thing
	to be ready for their challenge, quite another to accept it.
	And if I had a piece of advice for you, this is it:
	Poke fun at balm, then suffer lethargy
	to irradiate its shallow flood in the new packaging
	our enemies processed. They should know.
	
	The Gold Dust Twins never stopped supplicating Hoosiers
	to limn the trail. There’s no Shakespeare.
	Through the window, Casanova.
	Couldn’t get to sleep in the dumb incident
	of those days, crimping the frozen feet of Lincoln.


7. THE BUNGALOWS

	Impatient as we were for all of them to join us,
	The land had not yet risen into view: gulls had swept the gray steel towers away
	So that it profited less to go searching, away over the humming earth
	Than to stay in immediate relation to these other things--boxes, store parts, whatever you wanted to call them--
	Whose installedness was the price of further revolutions, so you knew this combat was the last.
	And still the relationship waxed, billowed like scenery on the breeze.
	
	They are the same aren’t they,
	The presumed landscape and the dream of home
	Because the people are all homesick today or desperately sleeping,   
	Trying to remember how those rectangular shapes
	Became so extraneous and so near
	To create a foreground of quiet knowledge
	In which youth had grown old, chanting and singing wise hymns that   
	Will sign for old age
	And so lift up the past to be persuaded, and be put down again.
	
	The warning is nothing more than an aspirate “h”;
	The problem is sketched completely, like fireworks mounted on poles:   
	Complexion of evening, the accurate voices of the others.
	During Coca-Cola lessons it becomes patent
	Of noise on the left, and we had so skipped a stage that   
	The great wave of the past, compounded in derision,   
	Submerged idea and non-dreamer alike   
	In falsetto starlight like “purity”
	Of design that had been the first danger sign
	To wash the sticky, icky stuff down the drain--pfui!
	
	How does it feel to be outside and inside at the same time,
	The delicious feeling of the air contradicting and secretly abetting
	The interior warmth? But the land curdles the dismay in which it’s written   
	Bearing to a final point of folly and doom
	The wisdom of these generations.
	Look at what you’ve done to the landscape--
	The ice cube, the olive--
	There is a perfect tri-city mesh of things
	Extending all the way along the river on both sides
	With the end left for thoughts on construction
	That are always turning to alps and thresholds
	Above the tide of others, feeding a European moss rose without glory.
	
	We shall very soon have the pleasure of recording
	A period of unanimous tergiversation in this respect
	And to make that pleasure the greater, it is worth while
	At the risk of tedious iteration, to put first upon record a final protest:   
	Rather decaying art, genius, inspiration to hold to
	An impossible “calque” of reality, than
	“The new school of the trivial, rising up on the field of battle,   
	Something of sludge and leaf-mold,” and life
	Goes trickling out through the holes, like water through a sieve,   
	All in one direction.
	
	You who were directionless, and thought it would solve everything if you found one,
	What do you make of this? Just because a thing is immortal
	Is that any reason to worship it? Death, after all, is immortal.   
	But you have gone into your houses and shut the doors, meaning   
	There can be no further discussion.
	And the river pursues its lonely course
	With the sky and the trees cast up from the landscape
	For green brings unhappiness--_le vert Porte malheur_.
	“The chartreuse mountain on the absinthe plain
	Makes the strong man’s tears tumble down like rain.”
	
	All this came to pass eons ago.
	Your program worked out perfectly. You even avoided
	The monotony of perfection by leaving in certain flaws:
	A backward way of becoming, a forced handshake,
	An absent-minded smile, though in fact nothing was left to chance.
	Each detail was startlingly clear, as though seen through a magnifying glass,   
	Or would have been to an ideal observer, namely yourself--
	For only you could watch yourself so patiently from afar
	The way God watches a sinner on the path to redemption,
	Sometimes disappearing into valleys, _but always on the way_,
	For it all builds up into something, meaningless or meaningful
	As architecture, because planned and then abandoned when completed,   
	To live afterwards, in sunlight and shadow, a certain amount of years.   
	Who cares about what was there before? There is no going back,   
	For standing still means death, and life is moving on,
	Moving on towards death. But sometimes standing still is also life.

9. BY GUESS AND BY GOSH

	O awaken with me
	the inquiring goodbyes.
	Ooh what a messy business
	a tangle and a muddle
	(and made it seem quite interesting).
	
	He ticks them off:
	leisure top,
	a different ride home,
	whispering, in a way,
	whispered whiskers,
	so many of the things you have to share.
	
	But I was getting on,
	and that’s what you don’t need.
	I’m certainly sorry about scaring your king,
	if indeed that’s what happened to him.
	You get Peanuts and War and Peace,
	some in rags, some in jags, some in
	velvet gown. They want
	the other side of the printing plant.
	
	There were concerns.
	Say hi to jock itch, leadership principles,
	urinary incompetence.
	Take that, perfect pitch.
	And say a word for the president,
	for the scholar magazines, papers, a streaming.
	Then you are interested in poetry.


10. CROSSROADS IN THE PAST

	That night the wind stirred in the forsythia bushes,
	but it was a wrong one, blowing in the wrong direction.
	“That’s silly. How can there be a wrong direction?
	‘It bloweth where it listeth,’ as you know, just as we do
	when we make love or do something else there are no rules for.”
	
	I tell you, something went wrong there a while back.
	Just don’t ask me what it was. Pretend I’ve dropped the subject.
	No, now you’ve got me interested, I want to know
	exactly what seems wrong to you, how something could
	
	seem wrong to you. In what way do things get to be wrong?
	I’m sitting here dialing my cellphone
	with one hand, digging at some obscure pebbles with my shovel
	with the other. And then something like braids will stand out,
	
	on horsehair cushions. That armchair is really too lugubrious.
	We’ve got to change all the furniture, fumigate the house,
	talk our relationship back to its beginnings. Say, you know
	that’s probably what’s wrong--the beginnings concept, I mean.
	I aver there are no beginnings, though there were perhaps some
	sometime. We’d stopped, to look at the poster the movie theater
	
	had placed freestanding on the sidewalk. The lobby cards
	drew us in. It was afternoon, we found ourselves
	sitting at the end of a row in the balcony; the theater was unexpectedly
	crowded. That was the day we first realized we didn’t fully
	know our names, yours or mine, and we left quietly
	amid the gray snow falling. Twilight had already set in.


11. DAY BUMP

	Whether the harborline or the east shoreline
	consummated it was nobody’s biz until you got there,
	eyelids ashimmer, content with one more dispensation
	from blue above. And just like we were saying,
	the people began to show some interest
	in the mud-choked harbor. It could be summer again
	for all anyone in our class knew.
	Yeah, that’s right. Bumped from our dog-perch,
	we’d had to roil with the last of them.
	
	It’s taken a while since I’ve been here,
	but I’m resolved. What, didn’t I print,
	little piles of notes, slopes almost Sicilian?
	Here is my friend:
	Socks for comfort (now boys) will see later. Did they come?
	The inner grocery had to take three sets of clips away.
	Speaking to him of intricate family affairs.
	I’m not what you think. Stay preconscious.
	It’s just the “flooding of the council.” No need to feel afraid.


12. ELECTIVE INFINITIES

	Thirsty? They race across ampersands,
	scrolling. He isn’t sure it’s his head.
	There’s a delay right now. Smoke backed up.
	Ladies please remove hats.
	
	It was all over by morning. The village idiot
	was surprised to see us. “. . . thought you were in Normandy.”
	Like all pendulums we were surprised,
	then slightly miffed at what seemed to be happening
	back in the bushes. Keep your ornaments,
	if that’s what they are. Return to sender, arse.
	
	At the intersection a statue of a policeman
	was directing traffic. It seemed likale a vacation,
	halloween or something. Process 
	was the only real thing that happened.
	We wove closer to the abyss, a maze of sunflowers.
	The dauphin said to take our time.


13. FARM IMPLEMENTS AND RUTABAGAS IN A LANDSCAPE

	The first of the undecoded messages read: “Popeye sits in thunder,   
	Unthought of. From that shoebox of an apartment,
	From livid curtain’s hue, a tangram emerges: a country.”
	Meanwhile the Sea Hag was relaxing on a green couch: “How pleasant   
	To spend one’s vacation _en la casa de Popeye_,” she scratched
	Her cleft chin’s solitary hair. She remembered spinach
	
	And was going to ask Wimpy if he had bought any spinach.   
	“M’love,” he intercepted, “the plains are decked out in thunder   
	Today, and it shall be as you wish.” He scratched
	The part of his head under his hat. The apartment
	Seemed to grow smaller. “But what if no pleasant
	Inspiration plunge us now to the stars? _For this is my country_.”
	
	Suddenly they remembered how it was cheaper in the country.   
	Wimpy was thoughtfully cutting open a number 2 can of spinach   
	When the door opened and Swee’pea crept in. “How pleasant!”
	But Swee’pea looked morose. A note was pinned to his bib. “Thunder   
	And tears are unavailing,” it read. “Henceforth shall Popeye’s apartment   
	Be but remembered space, toxic or salubrious, whole or scratched.”
	
	Olive came hurtling through the window; its geraniums scratched
	Her long thigh. “I have news!” she gasped. “Popeye, forced as you know to flee the country
	One musty gusty evening, by the schemes of his wizened, duplicate father, jealous of the apartment
	And all that it contains, myself and spinach
	In particular, heaves bolts of loving thunder
	At his own astonished becoming, rupturing the pleasant
	
	Arpeggio of our years. No more shall pleasant
	Rays of the sun refresh your sense of growing old, nor the scratched   
	Tree-trunks and mossy foliage, only immaculate darkness and thunder.”   
	She grabbed Swee’pea. “I’m taking the brat to the country.”
	“But you can’t do that--he hasn’t even finished his spinach,”   
	Urged the Sea Hag, looking fearfully around at the apartment.
	
	But Olive was already out of earshot. Now the apartment
	Succumbed to a strange new hush. “Actually it’s quite pleasant
	Here,” thought the Sea Hag. “If this is all we need fear from spinach
	Then I don’t mind so much. Perhaps we could invite Alice the Goon over”--she scratched
	One dug pensively--“but Wimpy is such a country
	Bumpkin, always burping like that.” Minute at first, the thunder
	
	Soon filled the apartment. It was domestic thunder,   
	The color of spinach. Popeye chuckled and scratched
	His balls: it sure was pleasant to spend a day in the country.


14. HONESTLY,

	we could send you out there
	to join the cackle squad,
	but hey, that highly accomplished,
	thinly regarded equestrian--well there was no way
	he was going to join the others’ field trip.
	Wouldn’t put his head on the table.
	But here’s the thing:
	
	They had owned great dread,
	knew of a way to get away from here
	through ice and smoke
	always clutching her fingers, like it says
	to do.
	
	Once we were passionate about the police,
	yawned in the teeth of pixels,
	but a far rumor blanked us out.
	We bathed in moonshine.
	Now, experts disagree.
	Were we unhappy or sublime?
	We’ll have to wait until the next time
	an angel comes rapping at the door
	to rejoice docently.
	
	(I know there’s a way to do this.)


15. HOW TO CONTINUE

	Oh there once was a woman
	and she kept a shop
	selling trinkets to tourists
	not far from a dock
	who came to see what life could be
	far back on the island.
	
	And it was always a party there
	always different but very nice
	New friends to give you advice
	or fall in love with you which is nice
	and each grew so perfectly from the other
	it was a marvel of poetry
	and irony
	
	And in this unsafe quarter
	much was scary and dirty
	but no one seemed to mind
	very much
	the parties went on from house to house
	There were friends and lovers galore
	all around the store
	There was moonshine in winter
	and starshine in summer
	and everybody was happy to have discovered
	what they discovered
	
	And then one day the ship sailed away
	There were no more dreamers just sleepers
	in heavy attitudes on the dock
	moving as if they knew how
	among the trinkets and the souvenirs
	the random shops of modern furniture
	and a gale came and said
	it is time to take all of you away
	from the tops of the trees to the little houses
	on little paths so startled
	
	And when it became time to go
	they none of them would leave without the other
	for they said we are all one here
	and if one of us goes the other will not go
	and the wind whispered it to the stars
	the people all got up to go
	and looked back on love


16. IF YOU SAID YOU WOULD COME WITH ME

	In town it was very urban but in the country cows were covering the hills. The clouds were near and very moist. I was walking along the pavement with Anna, enjoying the scattered scenery. Suddenly a sound like a deep bell came from behind us. We both turned to look. “It’s the words you spoke in the past, coming back to haunt you,” Anna explained. “They always do, you know.”
	Indeed I did. Many times this deep bell-like tone had intruded itself on my thoughts, scrambling them at first, then rearranging them in apple-pie order. “Two crows,” the voice seemed to say, “were sitting on a sundial in the God-given sunlight. Then one flew away.”
	“Yes . . . and then?” I wanted to ask, but I kept silent. We turned into a courtyard and walked up several flights of stairs to the roof, where a party was in progress. “This is my friend Hans,” Anna said by way of introduction. No one paid much attention and several guests moved away to the balustrade to admire the view of orchards and vineyards, approaching their autumn glory. One of the women however came to greet us in a friendly manner. I was wondering if this was a “harvest home,” a phrase I had often heard but never understood.
	“Welcome to my home . . . well, to our home,” the woman said gaily. “As you can see, the grapes are being harvested.” It seemed she could read my mind. “They say this year’s vintage will be a mediocre one, but the sight is lovely, nonetheless. Don’t you agree, Mr. . . .”
	“Hans,” I replied curtly. The prospect was indeed a lovely one, but I wanted to leave. Making some excuse I guided Anna by the elbow toward the stairs and we left.
	“That wasn’t polite of you,” she said dryly.
	“Honey, I’ve had enough of people who can read your mind. When I want it done I’ll go to a mind reader.”
	“I happen to be one and I can tell you what you’re thinking is false. Listen to what the big bell says: ‘We are all strangers on our own turf, in our own time.’ You should have paid attention. Now adjustments will have to be made.”


17. INSTEAD OF LOSING

	Anyone, growing up in a space you hadn’t used yet
	would’ve done the same: bother the family’s bickering
	to head straight into the channel. My, those times
	crackled near about us, from sickly melodrama
	instead of losing, and the odd confusion . . . confusion.
	
	I thought of it then, and in the mountains.
	During the day we perforated the eponymous city limits
	and then some. No one knew all about us
	but some knew plenty. It was time to leave that town
	for an empty drawer
	into which they sailed. Some of the eleven thousand
	virgins were getting queasy. I say, stop the ship!
	No can do. Here come the bald arbiters
	with their eyes on chains, just so, like glasses.
	Heck, it’s only a muskrat
	that’s seen better years, when things were medieval
	and gold . . .
	
	So you people in the front,
	leave. You see them. And you understand it all.
	It doesn’t end, night’s sorcery notwithstanding.
	Would you have preferred to be a grownup in earlier times
	than the child can contain or imagine?
	Or is right now the answer--you know, the radio
	we heard news on late at night,
	our checkered fortunes so pretty.
	Here’s your ton of plumes, and your Red Seal Records.
	The whole embrace.


18. THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL

	As I sit looking out of a window of the building
	I wish I did not have to write the instruction manual on the uses of a new metal.
	I look down into the street and see people, each walking with an inner peace,   
	And envy them--they are so far away from me!
	Not one of them has to worry about getting out this manual on schedule.   
	And, as my way is, I begin to dream, resting my elbows on the desk and leaning out of the window a little,
	Of dim Guadalajara! City of rose-colored flowers!
	City I wanted most to see, and most did not see, in Mexico!
	But I fancy I see, under the press of having to write the instruction manual,   
	Your public square, city, with its elaborate little bandstand!
	The band is playing _Scheherazade_ by Rimsky-Korsakov.
	Around stand the flower girls, handing out rose- and lemon-colored flowers,   
	Each attractive in her rose-and-blue striped dress (Oh! such shades of rose and blue),
	And nearby is the little white booth where women in green serve you green and yellow fruit.
	The couples are parading; everyone is in a holiday mood.
	First, leading the parade, is a dapper fellow
	Clothed in deep blue. On his head sits a white hat
	And he wears a mustache, which has been trimmed for the occasion.
	His dear one, his wife, is young and pretty; her shawl is rose, pink, and white.   
	Her slippers are patent leather, in the American fashion,
	And she carries a fan, for she is modest, and does not want the crowd to see her face too often.
	But everybody is so busy with his wife or loved one
	I doubt they would notice the mustachioed man’s wife.
	Here come the boys! They are skipping and throwing little things on the sidewalk
	Which is made of gray tile. One of them, a little older, has a toothpick in his teeth.
	He is silenter than the rest, and affects not to notice the pretty young girls in white.
	But his friends notice them, and shout their jeers at the laughing girls.   
	Yet soon all this will cease, with the deepening of their years,
	And love bring each to the parade grounds for another reason.
	But I have lost sight of the young fellow with the toothpick.
	Wait--there he is--on the other side of the bandstand,
	Secluded from his friends, in earnest talk with a young girl
	Of fourteen or fifteen. I try to hear what they are saying
	But it seems they are just mumbling something--shy words of love, probably.
	She is slightly taller than he, and looks quietly down into his sincere eyes.   
	She is wearing white. The breeze ruffles her long fine black hair against her olive cheek.
	Obviously she is in love. The boy, the young boy with the toothpick, he is in love too;
	His eyes show it. Turning from this couple,
	I see there is an intermission in the concert.
	The paraders are resting and sipping drinks through straws
	(The drinks are dispensed from a large glass crock by a lady in dark blue),   
	And the musicians mingle among them, in their creamy white uniforms, and talk
	About the weather, perhaps, or how their kids are doing at school.
	
	Let us take this opportunity to tiptoe into one of the side streets.   
	Here you may see one of those white houses with green trim   
	That are so popular here. Look--I told you!
	It is cool and dim inside, but the patio is sunny.
	An old woman in gray sits there, fanning herself with a palm leaf fan.   
	She welcomes us to her patio, and offers us a cooling drink.   
	“My son is in Mexico City,” she says. “He would welcome you too   
	If he were here. But his job is with a bank there.
	Look, here is a photograph of him.”
	And a dark-skinned lad with pearly teeth grins out at us from the worn leather frame.
	We thank her for her hospitality, for it is getting late
	And we must catch a view of the city, before we leave, from a good high place.
	That church tower will do--the faded pink one, there against the fierce blue of the sky. Slowly we enter.
	The caretaker, an old man dressed in brown and gray, asks us how long we have been in the city, and how we like it here.
	His daughter is scrubbing the steps--she nods to us as we pass into the tower.
	Soon we have reached the top, and the whole network of the city extends before us.
	There is the rich quarter, with its houses of pink and white, and its crumbling, leafy terraces.
	There is the poorer quarter, its homes a deep blue.
	There is the market, where men are selling hats and swatting flies
	And there is the public library, painted several shades of pale green and beige.
	Look! There is the square we just came from, with the promenaders.   
	There are fewer of them, now that the heat of the day has increased,   
	But the young boy and girl still lurk in the shadows of the bandstand.   
	And there is the home of the little old lady--
	She is still sitting in the patio, fanning herself.
	How limited, but how complete withal, has been our experience of Guadalajara!
	We have seen young love, married love, and the love of an aged mother for her son.
	We have heard the music, tasted the drinks, and looked at colored houses.   
	What more is there to do, except stay? And that we cannot do.
	And as a last breeze freshens the top of the weathered old tower, I turn my
	gaze
	Back to the instruction manual which has made me dream of Guadalajara.


19. LEAVE THE HAND IN

	Furthermore, Mr. Tuttle used to have to run in the streets.   
	Now, each time friendship happens, they’re fully booked.   
	Sporting with amaryllis in the shade is all fine and good,   
	but when your sparring partner gets there first   
	you wonder if it was all worth it. “Yes, why do it?”   
	I’m on hold. It will take quite a lot for this music   
	to grow on me. I meant no harm. I’ve helped him   
	from getting stuck before. Dumb thing. All my appetites are friendly.   
	Children too are free to go and come as they please.   
	I ask you only to choose between us, then shut down this election.   
	But don’t reveal too much of your hand at any given time.   
	Then up and pipes the major, leave the hand in,   
	or change the vows. The bold, enduring menace of courtship is upon us   
	like the plague, and none of us can say what trouble   
	will be precipitated once it has had its way with us.   
	Our home is marshland. After dinner was wraparound.   
	You got a tender little look at it.   
	
	Outside, it never did turn golden.


20. LIKE A SENTENCE

	How little we know,   
	and when we know it!
	
	It was prettily said that “No man
	hath an abundance of cows on the plain, nor shards
	in his cupboard.” Wait! I think I know who said that! It was . . .
	
	Never mind, dears, the afternoon
	will fold you up, along with preoccupations   
	that now seem so important, until only a child   
	running around on a unicycle occupies center stage.   
	Then what will you make of walls? And I fear you   
	will have to come up with something,
	
	be it a terraced gambit above the sea
	or gossip overheard in the marketplace.
	For you see, it becomes you to be chastened:
	for the old to envy the young,
	and for youth to fear not getting older,
	where the paths through the elms, the carnivals, begin.
	
	And it was said of Gyges that his ring
	attracted those who saw him not,
	just as those who wandered through him were aware
	only of a certain stillness, such as precedes an earache,
	while lumberjacks in headbands came down to see what all the fuss was about,
	whether it was something they could be part of
	_sans_ affront to self-esteem.
	And those temple hyenas who had seen enough,
	nostrils aflare, fur backing up in the breeze,
	were no place you could count on,
	having taken a proverbial powder
	as rifle butts received another notch.
	I, meanwhile . . . I was going to say I had squandered spring   
	when summer came along and took it from me   
	like a terrier a lady has asked one to hold for a moment
	while she adjusts her stocking in the mirror of a weighing machine.   
	But here it is winter, and wrong
	to speak of other seasons as though they exist.   
	Time has only an agenda
	in the wallet at his back, while we
	who think we know where we are going unfazed
	end up in brilliant woods, nourished more than we can know
	by the unexpectedness of ice and stars
	and crackling tears. We’ll just have to make a go of it,
	a run for it. And should the smell of baking cookies appease
	one or the other of the olfactory senses, climb down   
	into this wagonload of prisoners.
	
	The meter will be screamingly clear then,
	the rhythms unbounced, for though we came
	to life as to a school, we must leave it without graduating   
	even as an ominous wind puffs out the sails
	of proud feluccas who don’t know where they’re headed,   
	only that a motion is etched there, shaking to be free.


21. A MAN OF WORDS

	His case inspires interest
	But little sympathy; it is smaller
	Than at first appeared. Does the furst nettle
	Make any difference as what grows
	Becomes a skit? Three sides enclosed,
	The fourth open to a wash of the weather,
	Exits and entrances, gestures theatrically meant
	To punctuate like doubled-over weeds as
	The garden fills up with snow?
	Ah, but this would have been another, quite other
	Entertainment, not the metallic taste
	In my mouth as I look away, density black as gunpowder
	In the angles where the grass writing goes on,
	Rose-red in unexpected places like the pressure
	Of fingers on a book suddenly snapped shut.
	
	Those tangled versions of the truth are
	Combed out, the snarls ripped out
	And spread around. Behind the mask
	Is still a continental appreciation
	Of what is fine, rarely appears and when it does is already
	Dying on the breeze that brought it to the threshold
	Of speech. The story worn out from telling.
	All diaries are alike, clear and cold, with
	The outlook for continued cold. They are placed
	Horizontal, parallel to the earth,
	Like the unencumbering dead. Just time to reread this
	And the past slips through your fingers, wishing you were
	 there.


22. THE MAUVE NOTEBOOK

	 “Say it enough times and it’s August.”
	 _--Geoffrey G. O’Brien, “Three Years”_
	
	On a set you need bush rebels,
	that numbing little chair while passing.
	If we knock ‘em out
	seven precincts are going to show up.
	It looks like you don’t need oil.
	I think it’ll be fine.
	Did she think that might be good,
	or for the man who listens to it,
	nothing to be done or thought,
	(section pending)?
	
	Or for the man who listens to it,
	an abrupt yawn, history or the other.
	Home economics.  Dr. Singalong
	can’t find his way back.
	I don’t know about that, but
	at her lamps do you still see
	the awkward ceremony, too serious?
	Leave it that way, imperfect start beyond
	where I was going.
	Prison outside the perpetual sonata,
	the only anxiety,
	since you wonder what they don’t do,
	from your red zero heart page
	waiting to touch your face.
	
	Although they know about it and
	it literally doesn’t exist,
	no, stay up and go to sleep,
	unless it falls on the right side of the brain
	positioned for so many forgeries,
	moon nugget...
	
	I don’t cut ‘em any slack.
	Assault on a clean front,
	that’s a lot to be turning into.
	
	These residents, they start throwing ‘em early.
	Continue to open your door to mud!                                                          
	
	Take the noon balloon to Rangoon,
	gutta percha academy,
	to the place of ice cream,
	
	because, really, what difference does it make?
	When it was time you went home.
	Tears and flowers,
	
	see how dirty your hands are.
	We had a lovely dime.
	Soon it will be seven I ask you.


23. MEAN PARTICLES

	Sometimes something like a second
	washes the base of this street.
	The father and his two assistants
	are given permission to go.
	One of them, a woman, asks, “Why
	did we come here in the first place,
	to this citadel of dampness?”
	
	Some days are worse than others,
	even if we can’t believe in them.
	But that was never a concern of mine,
	reasoned the patient.
	
	Sing, scroll, or never be blasted by us
	into marmoreal meaning, or the fist for it.
	Kudos to the prince who journeyed here
	to negotiate our release, if you can believe it.
	
	You’re right. The ballads are retreating
	back into the atmosphere.
	They won’t be coming round again.
	Make your peace.


24. MEANINGFUL LOVE

	What the bad news was
	became apparent too late
	for us to do anything good about it.
	
	I was offered no urgent dreaming,
	didn’t need a name or anything.
	Everything was taken care of.
	
	In the medium-size city of my awareness
	voles are building colossi.
	The blue room is over there.
	
	He put out no feelers.
	The day was all as one to him.
	Some days he never leaves his room
	and those are the best days,
	by far.
	
	There were morose gardens farther down the slope,
	anthills that looked like they belonged there.
	The sausages were undercooked, 
	the wine too cold, the bread molten.
	Who said to bring sweaters?
	The climate’s not that dependable.
	
	The Atlantic crawled slowly to the left
	pinning a message on the unbound golden hair of sleeping maidens,
	a ruse for next time,
	
	where fire and water are rampant in the streets,
	the gate closed--no visitors today
	or any evident heartbeat.
	
	I got rid of the book of fairy tales,
	pawned my old car, bought a ticket to the funhouse,
	found myself back here at six o’clock,
	pondering “possible side effects.”
	
	There was no harm in loving then,
	no certain good either. But love was loving servants
	or bosses. No straight road issuing from it.
	Leaves around the door are penciled losses.
	Twenty years to fix it.
	Asters bloom one way or another.


25. MOTTLED TUESDAY

	Something was about to go laughably wrong,
	whether directly at home or here,
	on this random shoal pleading with its eyes
	till it too breaks loose, caught in a hail of references.
	I’ll add one more scoop
	to the pile of retail.
	
	Hey, you’re doing it, like I didn’t tell you
	to, my sinking laundry boat, point of departure,
	my white pomegranate, my swizzle stick.
	We’re leaving again of our own volition
	for bogus patterned plains streaked by canals,
	maybe. Amorous ghosts will pursue us
	for a time, but sometimes they get, you know, confused and
	forget to stop when we do, as they continue to populate this
	fertile land with their own bizarre self-imaginings.
	Here’s hoping the referral goes tidily, O brother.
	Chime authoritatively with the pop-ups and extras.
	Keep your units pliable and folded,
	the recourse a mere specter, like you have it coming to you,
	awash with the new day and its abominable antithesis,
	OK? Don’t be able to make that distinction.


26. THE NEW HIGHER

	You meant more than life to me. I lived through
	you not knowing, not knowing I was living.
	I learned that you called for me. I came to where
	you were living, up a stair. There was no one there.
	No one to appreciate me. The legality of it
	upset a chair. Many times to celebrate
	we were called together and where
	we had been there was nothing there,
	nothing that is anywhere. We passed obliquely,
	leaving no stare. When the sun was done muttering,
	in an optimistic way, it was time to leave that there.
	
	Blithely passing in and out of where, blushing shyly
	at the tag on the overcoat near the window where
	the outside crept away, I put aside the there and now.
	Now it was time to stumble anew,
	blacking out when time came in the window.
	There was not much of it left.
	I laughed and put my hands shyly
	across your eyes. Can you see now?
	Yes I can see I am only in the where
	where the blossoming stream takes off, under your window.
	Go presently you said. Go from my window.
	I am in love with your window I cannot undermine
	it, I said.


27. THE ONE THING THAT CAN SAVE AMERICA

	Is anything central?
	Orchards flung out on the land,
	Urban forests, rustic plantations, knee-high hills?
	Are place names central?
	Elm Grove, Adcock Corner, Story Book Farm?
	As they concur with a rush at eye level
	Beating themselves into eyes which have had enough
	Thank you, no more thank you.
	And they come on like scenery mingled with darkness
	The damp plains, overgrown suburbs,
	Places of known civic pride, of civil obscurity.
	
	These are connected to my version of America
	But the juice is elsewhere.
	This morning as I walked out of your room
	After breakfast crosshatched with
	Backward and forward glances, backward into light,
	Forward into unfamiliar light,
	Was it our doing, and was it
	The material, the lumber of life, or of lives
	We were measuring, counting?
	A mood soon to be forgotten
	In crossed girders of light, cool downtown shadow
	In this morning that has seized us again?
	
	I know that I braid too much on my own
	Snapped-off perceptions of things as they come to me.
	They are private and always will be.
	Where then are the private turns of event
	Destined to bloom later like golden chimes
	Released over a city from a highest tower?
	The quirky things that happen to me, and I tell you,
	And you know instantly what I mean?
	What remote orchard reached by winding roads
	Hides them? Where are these roots?
	
	It is the lumps and trials
	That tell us whether we shall be known
	And whether our fate can be exemplary, like a star.
	All the rest is waiting
	For a letter that never arrives,
	Day after day, the exasperation
	Until finally you have ripped it open not knowing what it is,
	The two envelope halves lying on a plate.
	The message was wise, and seemingly
	Dictated a long time ago.
	Its truth is timeless, but its time has still
	Not arrived, telling of danger, and the mostly limited
	Steps that can be taken against danger
	Now and in the future, in cool yards,
	In quiet small houses in the country,
	Our country, in fenced areas, in cool shady streets.


28. THE PAINTER

	Sitting between the sea and the buildings
	He enjoyed painting the sea’s portrait.
	But just as children imagine a prayer
	Is merely silence, he expected his subject
	To rush up the sand, and, seizing a brush,
	Plaster its own portrait on the canvas.
	
	So there was never any paint on his canvas
	Until the people who lived in the buildings
	Put him to work: “Try using the brush
	As a means to an end. Select, for a portrait,
	Something less angry and large, and more subject
	To a painter’s moods, or, perhaps, to a prayer.”
	
	How could he explain to them his prayer
	That nature, not art, might usurp the canvas?
	He chose his wife for a new subject,
	Making her vast, like ruined buildings,
	As if, forgetting itself, the portrait
	Had expressed itself without a brush.
	
	Slightly encouraged, he dipped his brush
	In the sea, murmuring a heartfelt prayer:
	“My soul, when I paint this next portrait
	Let it be you who wrecks the canvas.”
	The news spread like wildfire through the buildings:
	He had gone back to the sea for his subject.
	
	Imagine a painter crucified by his subject!
	Too exhausted even to lift his brush,
	He provoked some artists leaning from the buildings
	To malicious mirth: “We haven’t a prayer
	Now, of putting ourselves on canvas,
	Or getting the sea to sit for a portrait!”
	
	Others declared it a self-portrait.
	Finally all indications of a subject
	Began to fade, leaving the canvas
	Perfectly white. He put down the brush.
	At once a howl, that was also a prayer,
	Arose from the overcrowded buildings.
	
	They tossed him, the portrait, from the tallest of the buildings;
	And the sea devoured the canvas and the brush
	As though his subject had decided to remain a prayer.


29. PEOPLE BEHAVING BADLY A CONCERN

	Aggressive panhandling, public urination, verbal threats,
	public nudity and violation of the open container law
	followed us down the days, for why
	are we here much longer,
	or even this long? I ask you
	to be civil and not interrupt night’s business.
	
	It was fun getting used to you,
	who couldn’t have been more nicer.
	This was as modern as it had ever been.
	They were influenced by him: some dirty magazine
	on the air tonight. (Amid the chaos, reports of survivors.)
	
	Didn’t the flowers’ restoration cat fugue keep spilling,
	and like that? It wouldn’t be the first time, either.
	The pro-taffeta get up and laugh,
	investigate or communicate. The night you were
	going to stay up late, others will kiss,
	and he talks about you, and I don’t know what.
	Come in, anyway,
	and don’t lack for tales of the Assertion.
	
	We’re talking civilian unrest.
	Yes, well, maybe you should take one.
	
	(Do not bite or chew.)


30. PROXIMITY

	It was great to see you the other day
	at the carnival. My enchiladas were delicious,
	
	and I hope that yours were too.
	I wanted to fulfill your dream of me
	
	in some suitable way. Giving away my new gloves,
	for instance, or putting a box around all that’s wrong with us.
	
	But these gutta percha lamps do not whisper on our behalf.
	Now sometimes in the evenings, I am lonely
	
	with dread. A rambunctious wind fills the pine
	at my doorstep, the woodbine is enchanted,
	
	and I must be off before the clock strikes
	whatever hour it is intent on.
	
	Do not leave me in this wilderness!
	Or, if you do, pay me to stay behind.


31. PYROGRAPHY

	Out here on Cottage Grove it matters. The galloping
	Wind balks at its shadow. The carriages
	Are drawn forward under a sky of fumed oak.
	This is America calling:
	The mirroring of state to state,   
	Of voice to voice on the wires,
	The force of colloquial greetings like golden
	Pollen sinking on the afternoon breeze.
	In service stairs the sweet corruption thrives;
	The page of dusk turns like a creaking revolving stage in Warren, Ohio.
	
	If this is the way it is let’s leave,
	They agree, and soon the slow boxcar journey begins,   
	Gradually accelerating until the gyrating fans of suburbs   
	Enfolding the darkness of cities are remembered   
	Only as a recurring tic. And midway
	We meet the disappointed, returning ones, without its   
	Being able to stop us in the headlong night
	Toward the nothing of the coast. At Bolinas
	The houses doze and seem to wonder why through the   
	Pacific haze, and the dreams alternately glow and grow dull.   
	Why be hanging on here? Like kites, circling,   
	Slipping on a ramp of air, but always circling?
	
	But the variable cloudiness is pouring it on,
	Flooding back to you like the meaning of a joke.
	The land wasn’t immediately appealing; we built it
	Partly over with fake ruins, in the image of ourselves:
	An arch that terminates in mid-keystone, a crumbling stone pier   
	For laundresses, an open-air theater, never completed
	And only partially designed. How are we to inhabit
	This space from which the fourth wall is invariably missing,   
	As in a stage-set or dollhouse, except by staying as we are,   
	In lost profile, facing the stars, with dozens of as yet
	Unrealized projects, and a strict sense
	Of time running out, of evening presenting   
	The tactfully folded-over bill? And we fit   
	Rather too easily into it, become transparent,   
	Almost ghosts. One day
	The birds and animals in the pasture have absorbed   
	The color, the density of the surroundings,   
	The leaves are alive, and too heavy with life.
	
	A long period of adjustment followed.
	In the cities at the turn of the century they knew about it   
	But were careful not to let on as the iceman and the milkman   
	Disappeared down the block and the postman shouted   
	His daily rounds. The children under the trees knew it   
	But all the fathers returning home
	On streetcars after a satisfying day at the office undid it:   
	The climate was still floral and all the wallpaper   
	In a million homes all over the land conspired to hide it.   
	One day we thought of painted furniture, of how   
	It just slightly changes everything in the room
	And in the yard outside, and how, if we were going
	To be able to write the history of our time, starting with today,   
	It would be necessary to model all these unimportant details   
	So as to be able to include them; otherwise the narrative   
	Would have that flat, sandpapered look the sky gets   
	Out in the middle west toward the end of summer,   
	The look of wanting to back out before the argument   
	Has been resolved, and at the same time to save appearances
	So that tomorrow will be pure. Therefore, since we have to do our business   
	In spite of things, why not make it in spite of everything?   
	That way, maybe the feeble lakes and swamps
	Of the back country will get plugged into the circuit   
	And not just the major events but the whole incredible
	Mass of everything happening simultaneously and pairing off,
	Channeling itself into history, will unroll
	As carefully and as casually as a conversation in the next room,   
	And the purity of today will invest us like a breeze,
	Only be hard, spare, ironical: something one can
	Tip one’s hat to and still get some use out of.
	
	The parade is turning into our street.
	My stars, the burnished uniforms and prismatic   
	Features of this instant belong here. The land
	Is pulling away from the magic, glittering coastal towns
	To an aforementioned rendezvous with August and December.   
	The hunch is it will always be this way,   
	The look, the way things first scared you   
	In the night light, and later turned out to be,   
	Yet still capable, all the same, of a narrow fidelity   
	To what you and they wanted to become:   
	No sighs like Russian music, only a vast unravelling   
	Out toward the junctions and to the darkness beyond   
	To these bare fields, built at today’s expense.


32. RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS

	On the secret map the assassins   
	Cloistered, the Moon River was marked   
	Near the eighteen peaks and the city
	Of humiliation and defeat--wan ending   
	Of the trail among dry, papery leaves   
	Gray-brown quills like thoughts
	In the melodious but vast mass of today’s   
	Writing through fields and swamps
	Marked, on the map, with little bunches of weeds.   
	Certainly squirrels lived in the woods   
	But devastation and dull sleep still   
	Hung over the land, quelled
	The rioters turned out of sleep in the peace of prisons   
	Singing on marble factory walls   
	Deaf consolation of minor tunes that pack   
	The air with heavy invisible rods   
	Pent in some sand valley from
	Which only quiet walking ever instructs.   
	The bird flew over and
	Sat--there was nothing else to do.
	Do not mistake its silence for pride or strength
	Or the waterfall for a harbor
	Full of light boats that is there
	Performing for thousands of people   
	In clothes some with places to go   
	Or games. Sometimes over the pillar   
	Of square stones its impact
	Makes a light print.
	So going around cities
	To get to other places you found   
	It all on paper but the land
	Was made of paper processed   
	To look like ferns, mud or other   
	Whose sea unrolled its magic   
	Distances and then rolled them up   
	Its secret was only a pocket
	After all but some corners are darker
	Than these moonless nights spent as on a raft
	In the seclusion of a melody heard   
	As though through trees
	And you can never ignite their touch   
	Long but there were homes
	Flung far out near the asperities   
	Of a sharp, rocky pinnacle
	And other collective places
	Shadows of vineyards whose wine   
	Tasted of the forest floor
	Fisheries and oyster beds
	Tides under the pole
	Seminaries of instruction, public   
	Places for electric light
	And the major tax assessment area   
	Wrinkled on the plan
	Of election to public office
	Sixty-two years old bath and breakfast   
	The formal traffic, shadows
	To make it not worth joining
	After the ox had pulled away the cart.
	
	Your plan was to separate the enemy into two groups   
	With the razor-edged mountains between.
	It worked well on paper
	But their camp had grown
	To be the mountains and the map   
	Carefully peeled away and not torn   
	Was the light, a tender but tough bark
	On everything. Fortunately the war was solved   
	In another way by isolating the two sections   
	Of the enemy’s navy so that the mainland   
	Warded away the big floating ships.   
	Light bounced off the ends   
	Of the small gray waves to tell   
	Them in the observatory   
	About the great drama that was being won
	To turn off the machinery
	And quietly move among the rustic landscape   
	Scooping snow off the mountains rinsing
	The coarser ones that love had   
	Slowly risen in the night to overflow   
	Wetting pillow and petal   
	Determined to place the letter
	On the unassassinated president’s desk
	So that a stamp could reproduce all this
	In detail, down to the last autumn leaf
	And the affliction of June ride
	Slowly out into the sun-blackened landscape.


33. THE SHORT ANSWER

	I am forced to sleepwalk much of the time.
	We hold on to these old ways, are troubled
	sometimes and then the geyser goes away,
	time gutted. In and of itself there is
	no great roar, force pitted against force that
	makes up in time what it loses in speed.
	The waterfalls, the canyon, a royal I-told-you-so
	comes back to greet us at the beginning.
	How was your trip? Oh I didn’t last
	you see, folded over like the margin
	of a dream of the thing-in-itself. Well, and
	what have we come to? A paper-thin past,
	just so, and ‘tis pity. We regurgitate
	old anthems and what has come to pass, and why
	dwell on these. Why make things more difficult
	than they already are? Because if it’s boring
	in a different way, that’ll be interesting too.
	That’s what I say.
	
	That rascal, he jumped over the fence.
	I’m wiping my pince-nez now. Did you ever hear from
	the one who said he’d be back once it was over,
	who eluded me even in my sleep? That was a particularly
	promising time, we thought. Now the sun’s out
	and it’s raining again. Just like a day from
	the compendium. I’ll vouch for you,
	and we can go on scrolling as though nothing had risen,
	the horizon forest looks back at us. The preacher
	shook his head, the evangelist balanced two spools
	at the end of his little makeshift rope. We’d gone too far.
	We’d have to come back in a day or so.


34. SLEEPERS AWAKE

	Cervantes was asleep when he wrote _Don Quixote_.
	Joyce slept during the Wandering Rocks section of _Ulysses_.
	Homer nodded and occasionally slept during the greater part of the _Iliad_; he was awake however when he wrote the _Odyssey_.
	Proust snored his way through _The Captive_, as have legions of his readers after him.
	Melville was asleep at the wheel for much of _Moby-Dick_.
	Fitzgerald slept through _Tender Is the Night_, which is perhaps not so surprising,
	but the fact that Mann slumbered on the very slopes of _The Magic Mountain_ is quite extraordinary--that he wrote it, even more so.   
	Kafka, of course, never slept, even while not writing or on bank holidays.
	No one knows too much about George Eliot’s writing habits--my guess is she would sleep a few minutes, wake up and write something, then pop back to sleep again.
	Lew Wallace’s forty winks came, incredibly, during the chariot race in _Ben-Hur_.
	Emily Dickinson slept on her cold, narrow bed in Amherst.
	When she awoke there would be a new poem inscribed by Jack Frost on the windowpane; outside, glass foliage chimed.
	Good old Walt snored as he wrote and, like so many of us, insisted he didn’t.
	Maugham snored on the Riviera.
	Agatha Christie slept daintily, as a woman sleeps, which is why her novels are like tea sandwiches--artistic, for the most part.
	I sleep when I cannot avoid it; my writing and sleeping are constantly improving.
	
	I have other things to say, but shall not detain you much.
	Never go out in a boat with an author--they cannot tell when they are over water.
	Birds make poor role models.
	A philosopher should be shown the door, but don’t, under any circumstances, try it.
	Slaves make good servants.
	Brushing the teeth may not always improve the appearance.
	Store clean rags in old pillow cases.
	Feed a dog only when he barks.
	Flush tea leaves down the toilet, coffee grounds down the sink.
	Beware of anonymous letters--you may have written them, in a wordless implosion of sleep.


35. SNOW FENCE

	Dieting aids posture,
	as reading helps thought.
	They may be forced
	into another shape, and the world
	around us becomes black
	with notions of the ground.
	
	A snow fence imposes that sleep
	All along it snow has chosen different shapes
	of busyness. It has been prevented
	from staying where it wanted to.
	Blue sky will pay for this
	music from an old Victrola
	singing about a lover and his henchman
	and the woman hiding in a barrel
	under the bridge.
	
	In the west it all turns to meat.
	A few are grateful, more are bored.
	We could have lunch by that lake,
	drink beer from a nearby farm.
	And the actors walked with me
	to those calms.


36. SOONEST MENDED

	Barely tolerated, living on the margin
	In our technological society, we were always having to be rescued   
	On the brink of destruction, like heroines in _Orlando Furioso_
	Before it was time to start all over again.
	There would be thunder in the bushes, a rustling of coils,   
	And Angelica, in the Ingres painting, was considering
	The colorful but small monster near her toe, as though wondering whether forgetting
	The whole thing might not, in the end, be the only solution.   
	And then there always came a time when
	Happy Hooligan in his rusted green automobile
	Came plowing down the course, just to make sure everything was O.K.,   
	Only by that time we were in another chapter and confused   
	About how to receive this latest piece of information.   
	_Was_ it information? Weren’t we rather acting this out   
	For someone else’s benefit, thoughts in a mind
	With room enough and to spare for our little problems (so they began to seem),
	Our daily quandary about food and the rent and bills to be paid?   
	To reduce all this to a small variant,
	To step free at last, minuscule on the gigantic plateau--
	This was our ambition: to be small and clear and free.   
	Alas, the summer’s energy wanes quickly,
	A moment and it is gone. And no longer
	May we make the necessary arrangements, simple as they are.   
	Our star was brighter perhaps when it had water in it.   
	Now there is no question even of that, but only
	Of holding on to the hard earth so as not to get thrown off,   
	With an occasional dream, a vision: a robin flies across   
	The upper corner of the window, you brush your hair away
	And cannot quite see, or a wound will flash
	Against the sweet faces of the others, something like:   
	This is what you wanted to hear, so why
	Did you think of listening to something else? We are all talkers   
	It is true, but underneath the talk lies
	The moving and not wanting to be moved, the loose
	Meaning, untidy and simple like a threshing floor.
	
	These then were some hazards of the course,
	Yet though we knew the course was hazards and nothing else   
	It was still a shock when, almost a quarter of a century later,   
	The clarity of the rules dawned on you for the first time.   
	_They_ were the players, and we who had struggled at the game   
	Were merely spectators, though subject to its vicissitudes
	And moving with it out of the tearful stadium, borne on shoulders, at last.
	Night after night this message returns, repeated
	In the flickering bulbs of the sky, raised past us, taken away from us,   
	Yet ours over and over until the end that is past truth,   
	The being of our sentences, in the climate that fostered them,   
	Not ours to own, like a book, but to be with, and sometimes   
	To be without, alone and desperate.
	But the fantasy makes it ours, a kind of fence-sitting
	Raised to the level of an esthetic ideal. These were moments, years,   
	Solid with reality, faces, namable events, kisses, heroic acts,   
	But like the friendly beginning of a geometrical progression
	Not too reassuring, as though meaning could be cast aside some day   
	When it had been outgrown. Better, you said, to stay cowering   
	Like this in the early lessons, since the promise of learning   
	Is a delusion, and I agreed, adding that
	Tomorrow would alter the sense of what had already been learned,   
	That the learning process is extended in this way, so that from this standpoint
	None of us ever graduates from college,
	For time is an emulsion, and probably thinking not to grow up   
	Is the brightest kind of maturity for us, right now at any rate.
	And you see, both of us were right, though nothing
	Has somehow come to nothing; the avatars
	Of our conforming to the rules and living
	Around the home have made--well, in a sense, “good citizens” of us,   
	Brushing the teeth and all that, and learning to accept
	The charity of the hard moments as they are doled out,
	For this is action, this not being sure, this careless
	Preparing, sowing the seeds crooked in the furrow,
	Making ready to forget, and always coming back
	To the mooring of starting out, that day so long ago.


37. STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN AT NIGHT

	Without thinking too much about it,
	prepare to go out into the city of your dreams.
	Now, look up. At first they cannot see you.
	Later, the adjustment will be made.
	Your boyfriend sips bark tea.
	
	The number should’ve turned up by now.
	Perhaps the driving rain impedes it,
	the recession. In any case there are two too many of
	 us here.
	We must double up, or die.
	
	And that might be a practical if remote solution.
	It’s not every day you get to bicycle past the ribbons
	of people, watch the grand hotels
	for some event thought imminent--not lost.
	
	If ever I was going to turn up your volume--
	but this isn’t about living, is it?
	Or is it? I mean, many suppers in the seven modes
	or grades, as many as can be made to last
	once the bosses and their beagles have passed through.


38. STREET MUSICIANS

	One died, and the soul was wrenched out   
	Of the other in life, who, walking the streets   
	Wrapped in an identity like a coat, sees on and on   
	The same corners, volumetrics, shadows   
	Under trees. Farther than anyone was ever   
	Called, through increasingly suburban airs   
	And ways, with autumn falling over everything:   
	The plush leaves the chattels in barrels   
	Of an obscure family being evicted
	Into the way it was, and is. The other beached   
	Glimpses of what the other was up to:
	Revelations at last. So they grew to hate and forget each other.
	
	So I cradle this average violin that knows   
	Only forgotten showtunes, but argues
	The possibility of free declamation anchored
	To a dull refrain, the year turning over on itself   
	In November, with the spaces among the days   
	More literal, the meat more visible on the bone.   
	Our question of a place of origin hangs
	Like smoke: how we picnicked in pine forests,
	In coves with the water always seeping up, and left   
	Our trash, sperm and excrement everywhere, smeared   
	On the landscape, to make of us what we could.


39. THE SUN

	The watermark said it was alone with us,
	“To do your keeping and comparing.
	But there were
	 bushes
	On the horizon shaped like hearts, spades, clubs and
	 diamonds.
	They were considered
	To belong to a second class, to which lower standards
	Were applied, as called for in the original rule,
	And these standards were now bent inward to become
	The invariable law, to which exceptions
	Were sometimes apposite, and they liked the new clime,
	
	So bracing here on the indigo slopes
	To which families of fathers and daughters have come
	Summer after summer, decade after decade, and it never
	 stops
	Being refreshing. It is a sign of maturity,
	This stationary innocence, and a proof
	Of our slow, millennial growth, ring after ring
	Just inside the bark. Yet we get along well without it.
	Water boils more slowly, and then faster
	At these altitudes, and slowness need never be something
	To criticize, for it has an investment in its own weight,
	Rare bird. We know we can never be anything but
	 parallel
	And proximate in our relations, but we are linked up
	Anyway in the sun’s equation, the house from which
	It steals forth on occasion, pretending, isn’t
	It funny, to pass unnoticed, until the deeply shelving
	Darker pastures project their own reflection
	And are caught in history,
	
	Transfixed, like caves against the sky
	Or rotting spars sketched in phosphorus, for what we
	did.


40. SYRINGA

	Orpheus liked the glad personal quality
	Of the things beneath the sky. Of course, Eurydice was a part   
	Of this. Then one day, everything changed. He rends   
	Rocks into fissures with lament. Gullies, hummocks   
	Can’t withstand it. The sky shudders from one horizon   
	To the other, almost ready to give up wholeness.   
	Then Apollo quietly told him: “Leave it all on earth.   
	Your lute, what point? Why pick at a dull pavan few care to   
	Follow, except a few birds of dusty feather,
	Not vivid performances of the past.” But why not?   
	All other things must change too.
	The seasons are no longer what they once were,   
	But it is the nature of things to be seen only once,
	As they happen along, bumping into other things, getting along   
	Somehow. That’s where Orpheus made his mistake.   
	Of course Eurydice vanished into the shade;
	She would have even if he hadn’t turned around.
	No use standing there like a gray stone toga as the whole wheel   
	Of recorded history flashes past, struck dumb, unable to utter an intelligent
	Comment on the most thought-provoking element in its train.   
	Only love stays on the brain, and something these people,   
	These other ones, call life. Singing accurately
	So that the notes mount straight up out of the well of   
	Dim noon and rival the tiny, sparkling yellow flowers   
	Growing around the brink of the quarry, encapsulates   
	The different weights of the things.
	                                                      But it isn’t enough   
	To just go on singing. Orpheus realized this
	And didn’t mind so much about his reward being in heaven   
	After the Bacchantes had torn him apart, driven   
	Half out of their minds by his music, what it was doing to them.
	Some say it was for his treatment of Eurydice.
	But probably the music had more to do with it, and   
	The way music passes, emblematic
	Of life and how you cannot isolate a note of it
	And say it is good or bad. You must
	Wait till it’s over. “The end crowns all,”
	Meaning also that the “tableau”
	Is wrong. For although memories, of a season, for example,   
	Melt into a single snapshot, one cannot guard, treasure   
	That stalled moment. It too is flowing, fleeting;   
	It is a picture of flowing, scenery, though living, mortal,   
	Over which an abstract action is laid out in blunt,   
	Harsh strokes. And to ask more than this
	Is to become the tossing reeds of that slow,
	Powerful stream, the trailing grasses
	Playfully tugged at, but to participate in the action   
	No more than this. Then in the lowering gentian sky   
	Electric twitches are faintly apparent first, then burst forth   
	Into a shower of fixed, cream-colored flares. The horses   
	Have each seen a share of the truth, though each thinks,   
	“I’m a maverick. Nothing of this is happening to me,   
	Though I can understand the language of birds, and   
	The itinerary of the lights caught in the storm is fully apparent to me.
	Their jousting ends in music much
	As trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm   
	And is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees, now, day after day.”
	
	But how late to be regretting all this, even
	Bearing in mind that regrets are always late, too late!   
	To which Orpheus, a bluish cloud with white contours,   
	Replies that these are of course not regrets at all,   
	Merely a careful, scholarly setting down of
	Unquestioned facts, a record of pebbles along the way.
	And no matter how all this disappeared,   
	Or got where it was going, it is no longer   
	Material for a poem. Its subject
	Matters too much, and not enough, standing there helplessly   
	While the poem streaked by, its tail afire, a bad   
	Comet screaming hate and disaster, but so turned inward   
	That the meaning, good or other, can never   
	Become known. The singer thinks
	Constructively, builds up his chant in progressive stages   
	Like a skyscraper, but at the last minute turns away.   
	The song is engulfed in an instant in blackness   
	Which must in turn flood the whole continent   
	With blackness, for it cannot see. The singer   
	Must then pass out of sight, not even relieved   
	Of the evil burthen of the words. Stellification   
	Is for the few, and comes about much later   
	When all record of these people and their lives   
	Has disappeared into libraries, onto microfilm.   
	A few are still interested in them. “But what about   
	So-and-so?” is still asked on occasion. But they lie   
	Frozen and out of touch until an arbitrary chorus
	Speaks of a totally different incident with a similar name   
	In whose tale are hidden syllables
	
	
	Of what happened so long before that
	In some small town, one indifferent summer.


41. TAHITI TROT

	We close in on ourselves,
	then yelp that the world is awry.
	If one person could see his (or her)
	reflection outlined in the mirror
	
	the last knot would come untied,
	the great ship slip into the depths
	of the Atlantic Ocean. Who told you
	to say that? Why have you come here?
	
	We need more people like you
	to tell us what we’re not like. True,
	aging would get lost in the process.
	We’d be sitting on the grass like young
	
	idiots, involved in some personal spell
	when the boiler exploded. You’d say,
	“I can’t get over that hat,” and I.
	pretending not to understand, would say,
	 “Can I get you anything?”


42. THE TENNIS COURT OATH

	What had you been thinking about
	the face studiously bloodied
	heaven blotted region
	I go on loving you like water but
	there is a terrible breath in the way all of this
	You were not elected president, yet won the race
	All the way through fog and drizzle
	When you read it was sincere the coasts
	stammered with unintentional villages the
	horse strains fatigued I guess . . . the calls . . .
	I worry
	
	the water beetle head
	why of course reflecting all
	then you redid you were breathing
	I thought going down to mail this
	of the kettle you jabbered as easily in the yard
	you come through but
	are incomparable the lovely tent
	mystery you don’t want surrounded the real
	you dance
	in the spring there was clouds
	
	The mulatress approached in the hall--the
	lettering easily visible along the edge of the _Times_
	in a moment the bell would ring but there was time
	for the carnation laughed here are a couple of “other”
	
	to one in yon house
	The doctor and Philip had come over the road
	Turning in toward the corner of the wall his hat on
	reading it carelessly as if to tell you your fears were justified
	the blood shifted you know those walls
	wind off the earth had made him shrink
	undeniably an oboe now the young
	were there there was candy
	to decide the sharp edge of the garment
	like a particular cry not intervening called the dog “he’s coming! he’s coming” with an emotion felt it sink into peace
	there was no turning back but the end was in sight
	he chose this moment to ask her in detail about her family and the others
	The person.   pleaded--“have more of these
	not stripes on the tunic--or the porch chairs
	will teach you about men--what it means”
	to be one in a million pink stripe
	and now could go away the three approached the doghouse
	the reef.   Your daughter’s
	dream of my son understand prejudice
	darkness in the hole
	the patient finished
	They could all go home now the hole was dark
	lilacs blowing across his face glad he brought you


43. THESE LACUSTRINE CITIES

	These lacustrine cities grew out of loathing
	Into something forgetful, although angry with history.
	They are the product of an idea: that man is horrible, for instance,   
	Though this is only one example.
	
	They emerged until a tower
	Controlled the sky, and with artifice dipped back
	Into the past for swans and tapering branches,
	Burning, until all that hate was transformed into useless love.
	
	Then you are left with an idea of yourself
	And the feeling of ascending emptiness of the afternoon   
	Which must be charged to the embarrassment of others   
	Who fly by you like beacons.
	
	The night is a sentinel.
	Much of your time has been occupied by creative games
	Until now, but we have all-inclusive plans for you.
	We had thought, for instance, of sending you to the middle of the desert,
	
	To a violent sea, or of having the closeness of the others be air   
	To you, pressing you back into a startled dream
	As sea-breezes greet a child’s face.
	But the past is already here, and you are nursing some private project.
	
	The worst is not over, yet I know
	You will be happy here. Because of the logic
	Of your situation, which is something no climate can outsmart.   
	Tender and insouciant by turns, you see
	
	You have built a mountain of something,
	Thoughtfully pouring all your energy into this single monument,   
	Whose wind is desire starching a petal,
	Whose disappointment broke into a rainbow of tears.


44. THIS ROOM

	The room I entered was a dream of this room.
	Surely all those feet on the sofa were mine.
	The oval portrait
	of a dog was me at an early age.
	Something shimmers, something is hushed up.
	
	We had macaroni for lunch every day
	except Sunday, when a small quail was induced
	to be served to us. Why do I tell you these things?
	You are not even here.


45. TOWER OF DARKNESS

	I cannot remain outside any longer
	in the cold and pervasive rain.
	I grab my crotch wishing for a ball of light
	in the shaggy interior other people have.
	I shall go away without fetching a grain
	from the earth, compact,
	with the climbing design
	we knew and hated so well, and when it was our turn
	to die we just gave up, mumbling some excuse.
	
	Do you often go to see them?
	They can’t have much cause
	to journey here, yet their footprints,
	foreclosed by snow . . .
	
	It was the barker whose patter started it
	well before we were awake, into the dawn
	that grizzles, now, a fright
	to be wished, to be read.
	unlike the old healing that will come again in time.


46. TRAIN RISING OUT OF THE SEA

	It is written in the Book of Usable Minutes
	That all things have their center in their dying,
	That each is discrete and diaphanous and
	Has pointed its prow away from the sand for the next
	 trillion years.
	
	After that, we may be friends,
	Recognizing in each other the precedents that make us
	 truly social.
	Do you hear the wind? It’s not dying,
	It’s singing, weaving a song about the president saluting
	 the trust.
	
	The past in each of us, until so much memory becomes
	 an institution,
	Through sheer weight, the persistence of it, no,
	Not the persistence, that makes it seem a deliberate act
	Of duration, much too deliberate for this ingenuous being
	
	Like an era that refuses to come to an end or be born
	 again.
	We need more night for the sky, more blue for the
	 daylight
	That inundates our remarks before we can make them
	Taking away a little bit of us each time
	
	To be deposited elsewhere
	In the place of our involvement
	With the core that brought excessive flowering this year
	Of enormous sunsets and big breezes
	
	That left you feeling too simple
	Like an island just off the shore, one of many, that no one
	Notices, though it has a certain function, though an
	 abstract one
	Built to prevent you from being towed to shore.


47. VETIVER

	Ages passed slowly, like a load of hay,
	As the flowers recited their lines
	And pike stirred at the bottom of the pond.
	The pen was cool to the touch.
	The staircase swept upward
	Through fragmented garlands, keeping the melancholy
	Already distilled in letters of the alphabet.
	
	It would be time for winter now, its spun-sugar
	Palaces and also lines of care
	At the mouth, pink smudges on the forehead and cheeks,
	The color once known as “ashes of roses.”
	How many snakes and lizards shed their skins
	For time to be passing on like this,
	Sinking deeper in the sand as it wound toward
	The conclusion. It had all been working so well and now,
	Well, it just kind of came apart in the hand
	As a change is voiced, sharp
	As a fishhook in the throat, and decorative tears flowed
	Past us into a basin called infinity.
	
	There was no charge for anything, the gates
	Had been left open intentionally.
	Don’t follow, you can have whatever it is.
	And in some room someone examines his youth,
	Finds it dry and hollow, porous to the touch.
	O keep me with you, unless the outdoors
	Embraces both of us, unites us, unless
	The birdcatchers put away their twigs,
	The fishermen haul in their sleek empty nets
	And others become part of the immense crowd
	Around this bonfire, a situation
	That has come to mean us to us, and the crying
	In the leaves is saved, the last silver drops.


48. A WORLDLY COUNTRY

	Not the smoothness, not the insane clocks on the square,
	the scent of manure in the municipal parterre,
	not the fabrics, the sullen mockery of Tweety Bird,
	not the fresh troops that needed freshening up. If it occurred
	in real time, it was OK, and if it was time in a novel
	that was OK too. From palace and hovel
	the great parade flooded avenue and byway
	and turnip fields became just another highway.
	Leftover bonbons were thrown to the chickens
	and geese, who squawked like the very dickens.
	There was no peace in the bathroom, none in the china closet
	or the banks, where no one came to make a deposit.
	In short all hell broke loose that wide afternoon.
	By evening all was calm again. A crescent moon
	hung in the sky like a parrot on its perch.
	Departing guests smiled and called, “See you in church!”
	For night, as usual, knew what it was doing,
	providing sleep to offset the great ungluing
	that tomorrow again would surely bring.
	As I gazed at the quiet rubble, one thing
	puzzled me: What had happened, and why?
	One minute we were up to our necks in rebelliousness,
	and the next, peace had subdued the ranks of hellishness.
	
	So often it happens that the time we turn around in
	soon becomes the shoal our pathetic skiff will run aground in.
	And just as waves are anchored to the bottom of the sea
	we must reach the shallows before God cuts us free.
