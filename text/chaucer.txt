*** Geoffrey Chaucer (1340 - 1400)


1. THE COMPLAINT UNTO PITY

	Pite, that I have sought so yore agoo
	With herte soore and ful of besy peyne,
	That in this world was never wight so woo
	Withoute deth--and yf I shal not feyne,
	My purpos was to Pite to compleyne
	Upon the crueltee and tirannye
	Of Love, that for my trouthe doth me dye.
	
	And when that I, be lengthe of certeyne yeres,
	Had evere in oon a tyme sought to speke,
	To Pitee ran I al bespreynt with teres
	To prayen hir on Cruelte me awreke.
	But er I myghte with any word outbreke
	Or tellen any of my peynes smerte,
	I fond hir ded, and buried in an herte.
	
	Adoun I fel when that I saugh the herse,
	Ded as a ston while that the swogh me laste;
	But up I roos with colour ful dyverse
	And pitously on hir myn eyen I caste,
	And ner the corps I gan to presen faste,
	And for the soule I shop me for to preye.
	I was but lorn, ther was no more to seye.
	
	Thus am I slayn sith that Pite is ded.
	Allas, that day, that ever hyt shulde falle.
	What maner man dar now hold up his hed?
	To whom shal any sorwful herte calle?
	Now Cruelte hath cast to slee us alle,
	In ydel hope, folk redeless of peyne,
	Syth she is ded, to whom shul we compleyne?
	
	But yet encreseth me this wonder newe,
	That no wight woot that she is ded, but I--
	So many men as in her tyme hir knewe--
	And yet she dyed not so sodeynly,
	For I have sought hir ever ful besely
	Sith first I hadde wit or mannes mynde,
	But she was ded er that I koude hir fynde.
	
	Aboute hir herse there stoden lustely,
	Withouten any woo as thoughte me,
	Bounte parfyt, wel armed and richely,
	And fresshe Beaute, Lust, and Jolyte,
	Assured Maner, Youthe, and Honeste,
	Wisdom, Estaat, Drede, and Governaunce,
	Confedred both by honde and alliaunce.
	
	A compleynt had I, writen in myn hond,
	For to have put to Pite as a bille;
	But when I al this companye ther fond,
	That rather wolden al my cause spille
	Then do me help, I held my pleynte stille,
	For to that folk, withouten any fayle,
	Withoute Pitee ther may no bille availe.
	
	Then leve I al these vertues, sauf Pite,
	Kepynge the corps as ye have herd me seyn,
	Confedered alle by bond of Cruelte[Riv., p. 641]
	And ben assented when I shal be sleyn.
	And I have put my complaynt up ageyn,
	For to my foes my bille I dar not shewe,
	Th’effect of which seith thus, in wordes fewe:
	
	
	_(The Bill of Complaint)_
	
	Humblest of herte, highest of reverence,
	Benygne flour, coroune of vertues alle,
	Sheweth unto youre rial excellence
	Youre servaunt, yf I durste me so calle,
	Hys mortal harm in which he is yfalle,
	And noght al oonly for his evel fare,
	But for your renoun, as he shal declare.
	
	Hit stondeth thus: your contraire, Crueltee,
	Allyed is ayenst your regalye
	Under colour of womanly Beaute--
	For men shulde not, lo, knowe hir tirannye--
	With Bounte, Gentilesse, and Curtesye,
	And hath depryved yow now of your place
	That hyghte “Beaute apertenant to Grace.’
	
	For kyndely by youre herytage ryght
	Ye ben annexed ever unto Bounte;
	And verrayly ye oughte do youre myght
	To helpe Trouthe in his adversyte.
	Ye be also the corowne of Beaute,
	And certes yf ye wanten in these tweyne,
	The world is lore; ther is no more to seyne.
	
	Eke what availeth Maner and Gentilesse
	Withoute yow, benygne creature?
	Shal Cruelte be your governeresse?
	Allas, what herte may hyt longe endure?
	Wherfore, but ye the rather take cure
	To breke that perilouse alliaunce,
	Ye sleen hem that ben in your obeisaunce.
	
	And further over yf ye suffre this,
	Youre renoun ys fordoo than in a throwe;
	Ther shal no man wite well what Pite is.
	Allas, that your renoun is falle so lowe!
	Ye be than fro youre heritage ythrowe
	By Cruelte that occupieth youre place,
	And we despeyred that seken to your grace.
	
	Have mercy on me, thow Herenus quene,
	That yow have sought so tendirly and yore;
	Let som strem of youre lyght on me be sene
	That love and drede yow ever lenger the more;
	For sothly for to seyne I bere the soore,
	And though I be not konnynge for to pleyne,
	For Goddis love have mercy on my peyne.
	
	My peyne is this, that what so I desire
	That have I not, ne nothing lyk therto;
	And ever setteth Desir myn hert on fire.
	Eke on that other syde where so I goo,
	What maner thing that may encrese my woo,
	That have I redy, unsoght, everywhere;
	Me lakketh but my deth and than my here.
	
	What nedeth to shewe parcel of my peyne?
	Syth every woo that herte may bethynke
	I suffre and yet I dar not to yow pleyne;
	For wel I wot although I wake or wynke,
	Ye rekke not whether I flete or synke.
	But natheles yet my trouthe I shal sustene
	Unto my deth, and that shal wel be sene.
	
	This is to seyne I wol be youres evere,
	Though ye me slee by Crueltee your foo,
	Algate my spirit shal never dissevere
	Fro youre servise for any peyne or woo.
	Sith ye be ded--allas that hyt is soo--
	Thus for your deth I may wel wepe and pleyne
	With herte sore and ful of besy peyne.



2. FORTUNE

	_Pleintif_
	
	This wrecched worldes transmutacioun,
	As wele or wo, now povre and now honour,
	Withouten ordre or wys discrecioun
	Governed is by Fortunes errour.
	But natheles, the lak of hir favour
	Ne may nat don me singen though I dye,
	Jay tout perdu mon temps et mon labour;
	For fynally, Fortune, I thee defye.
	
	Yit is me left the light of my resoun
	To knowen frend fro fo in thy mirour.
	So muchel hath yit thy whirling up and doun
	Ytaught me for to knowen in an hour.
	But trewely, no force of thy reddour
	To him that over himself hath the maystrye.
	My suffisaunce shal be my socour,
	For fynally Fortune, I thee defye.
	
	O Socrates, thou stidfast champioun,
	She never mighte be thy tormentour;
	Thou never dreddest hir oppressioun,
	Ne in hir chere founde thou no savour.
	Thou knewe wel the deceit of hir colour,
	And that hir moste worshipe is to lye.
	I knowe hir eek a fals dissimulour,
	For fynally, Fortune, I thee defye!
	
	
	_La respounse de Fortune au Pleintif_
	
	No man is wrecched but himself it wene,
	And he that hath himself hath suffisaunce.
	Why seystow thanne I am to thee so kene,
	That hast thyself out of my governaunce?
	Sey thus: “Graunt mercy of thyn haboundaunce
	That thou hast lent or this.’ Why wolt thou stryve?
	What wostow yit how I thee wol avaunce?
	And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve.
	
	I have thee taught divisioun bitwene
	Frend of effect and frend of countenaunce;
	Thee nedeth nat the galle of noon hyene,
	That cureth eyen derked for penaunce;
	Now seestow cleer that were in ignoraunce.
	Yit halt thyn ancre and yit thou mayst arryve
	Ther bountee berth the keye of my substaunce,
	And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve.
	
	How many have I refused to sustene
	Sin I thee fostred have in thy plesaunce.
	Woltow than make a statut on thy quene
	That I shal been ay at thyn ordinaunce?
	Thou born art in my regne of variaunce,
	Aboute the wheel with other most thou dryve.
	My lore is bet than wikke is thy grevaunce,
	And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve.
	
	
	_La respounse du Pleintif countre Fortune_
	
	Thy lore I dampne; it is adversitee.
	My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse;
	That I thy frendes knowe, I thanke it thee.
	Tak hem agayn, lat hem go lye on presse.
	The negardye in keping hir richesse
	Prenostik is thou wolt hir tour assayle;
	Wikke appetyt comth ay before syknesse.
	In general, this reule may nat fayle.
	
	
	_La respounse de Fortune countre le Pleintif_
	
	Thou pinchest at my mutabilitee
	For I thee lente a drope of my richesse,
	And now me lyketh to withdrawe me.
	Why sholdestow my realtee oppresse?
	The see may ebbe and flowen more or lesse;
	The welkne hath might to shyne, reyne, or hayle;
	Right so mot I kythen my brotelnesse.
	In general, this reule may nat fayle.
	
	Lo, th’execucion of the majestee
	That al purveyeth of his rightwysnesse,
	That same thing “Fortune’” clepen ye,
	Ye blinde bestes ful of lewdednesse.
	The hevene hath propretee of sikernesse.
	This world hath ever resteles travayle;
	Thy laste day is ende of myn intresse.
	In general, this reule may nat fayle.
	
	
	_L’envoy de Fortune_
	
	Princes, I prey you of your gentilesse
	Lat nat this man on me thus crye and pleyne,
	And I shal quyte you your bisinesse
	At my requeste, as three of you or tweyne,
	And but you list releve him of his peyne,
	Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse
	That to som beter estat he may atteyne.



3. LAK OF STEDFASTNESSE

	Somtyme the world was so stedfast and stable
	That mannes word was obligacioun,
	And now it is so fals and deceivable
	That word and deed, as in conclusioun,
	Ben nothing lyk, for turned up-so-doun
	Is al this world for mede and wilfulnesse,
	That al is lost for lak of stedfastnesse.
	
	What maketh this world to be so variable
	But lust that folk have in dissensioun?
	For among us now a man is holde unable,
	But if he can by som collusioun
	Don his neighbour wrong or oppressioun.
	What causeth this but wilful wrecchednesse,
	That al is lost for lak of stedfastnesse?
	
	Trouthe is put doun, resoun is holden fable,
	Vertu hath now no dominacioun;
	Pitee exyled, no man is merciable.
	Through covetyse is blent discrecioun.
	The world hath mad a permutacioun
	Fro right to wrong, fro trouthe to fikelnesse,
	That al is lost for lak of stedfastnesse.
	
	O prince, desyre to be honourable,
	Cherish thy folk and hate extorcioun.
	Suffre nothing that may be reprevable
	To thyn estat don in thy regioun.
	Shew forth thy swerd of castigacioun,
	Dred God, do law, love trouthe and worthinesse,
	And wed thy folk agein to stedfastnesse.



4. PROVERBS

	What should these clothes thus manifold,
	Lo! this hot summer’s day?
	After great heate cometh cold;
	No man cast his pilche away.
	Of all this world the large compass
	Will not in mine arms twain;
	Who so muche will embrace,
	Little thereof he shall distrain.
	
	The world so wide, the air so remuable,
	The silly man so little of stature;
	The green of ground and clothing so mutable,
	The fire so hot and subtile of nature;
	The water never in one--what creature
	That made is of these foure thus flitting,
	May steadfast be, as here, in his living?
	
	The more I go, the farther I am behind;
	The farther behind, the nearer my war’s end;
	The more I seek, the worse can I find;
	The lighter leave, the lother for to wend;
	The better I live, the more out of mind;
	Is this fortune, n’ot I, or infortune;
	Though I go loose, tied am I with a loigne.



5. TRUTH

	Fle fro the pres, and dwelle with sothefastnesse,
	Suffise thin owen thing, thei it be smal;
	For hord hath hate, and clymbyng tykelnesse,
	Prees hath envye, and wele blent overal.
	Savour no more thanne the byhove schal;
	Reule weel thiself, that other folk canst reede;
	And trouthe schal delyvere, it is no drede.
	
	     Tempest the nought al croked to redresse,
	In trust of hire that tourneth as a bal.
	Myche wele stant in litel besynesse;
	Bywar therfore to spurne ayeyns an al;
	Stryve not as doth the crokke with the wal.
	Daunte thiself, that dauntest otheres dede;
	And trouthe shal delyvere, it is no drede.
	
	     That the is sent, receyve in buxumnesse;
	The wrestlyng for the worlde axeth a fal.
	Here is non home, here nys but wyldernesse.
	Forth, pylgryme, forth! forth, beste, out of thi stal!
	Know thi contré! loke up! thonk God of al!
	Hold the heye weye, and lat thi gost the lede;
	And trouthe shal delyvere, it is no drede.
	
	     Therfore, thou Vache, leve thine olde wrechednesse;
	Unto the world leve now to be thral.
	Crie hym mercy, that of hys hie godnesse
	Made the of nought, and in espec{.i}al
	Draw unto hym, and pray in general
	For the, and eke for other, hevenelyche mede;
	And trouthe schal delyvere, it is no drede.
