{"A HIDDEN LIFE": "Proudly the youth by manhood sudden crowned\nWent walking by his horses to the plough\nFor the first time that morn. No soldier gay\nFeels at his side the throb of the gold hilt\n(Knowing the blue blade hides within its sheath\nAs lightning in the cloud) with more delight\nWhen first he belts it on than he that day\nHeard still the clank of the plough-chains against\nThe horses' harnessed sides as to the field\nThey went to make it fruitful. O'er the hill\nThe sun looked down baptizing him for toil.\n\nA farmer's son he was and grandson too;\nYea his great-grandsire had possessed these fields.\nTradition said they had been tilled by men\nWho bore the name long centuries ago\nAnd married wives and reared a stalwart race\nAnd died and went where all had followed them\nSave one old man his daughter and the youth\nWho ploughs in pride nor ever doubts his toil;\nAnd death is far from him this sunny morn.\nWhy should we think of death when life is high?\nThe earth laughs all the day and sleeps all night.\nEarth give us food and after that a grave;\nFor both are good each better in its time.\n\nThe youth knew little; but he read old tales\nOf Scotland's warriors till his blood ran swift\nAs charging knights upon their death career.\nAnd then he chanted old tunes till the blood\nWas charmed back into its fountain-well\nAnd tears arose instead. And Robert's songs\nWhich ever flow in noises like his name\nRose from him in the fields beside the kine\nAnd met the sky-lark's rain from out the clouds.\nAs yet he sang only as sing the birds\nFrom gladness simply or he knew not why.\nThe earth was fair--he knew not it was fair;\nAnd he so glad--he knew not he was glad:\nHe walked as in a twilight of the sense\nWhich this one day shall turn to tender light.\n\nFor ere the sun had cleared the feathery tops\nOf the fir-thicket on the eastward hill\nHis horses leaned and laboured. His great hands\nHeld both the reins and plough-stilts: he was proud;\nProud with a ploughman's pride; nobler may be\nThan statesman's ay or poet's pride sometimes\nFor little praise would come that he ploughed well\nAnd yet he did it well; proud of his work\nAnd not of what would follow. With sure eye\nHe saw the horses keep the arrow-track;\nHe saw the swift share cut the measured sod;\nHe saw the furrow folding to the right\nReady with nimble foot to aid at need.\nAnd there the slain sod lay patient for grain\nTurning its secrets upward to the sun\nAnd hiding in a grave green sun-born grass\nAnd daisies clipped in carmine: all must die\nThat others live and they arise again.\n\nThen when the sun had clomb to his decline\nAnd seemed to rest before his slow descent\nUpon the keystone of his airy bridge\nThey rested likewise half-tired man and horse\nAnd homeward went for food and courage new;\nWhereby refreshed they turned again to toil\nAnd lived in labour all the afternoon.\nTill in the gloaming once again the plough\nLay like a stranded bark upon the lea;\nAnd home with hanging neck the horses went\nWalking beside their master force by will.\nThen through the deepening shades a vision came.\n\nIt was a lady mounted on a horse\nA slender girl upon a mighty steed\nThat bore her with the pride horses must feel\nWhen they submit to women. Home she went\nAlone or else the groom lagged far behind.\nBut as she passed some faithless belt gave way;\nThe saddle slipped the horse stopped and the girl\nStood on her feet still holding fast the reins.\n\nThree paces bore him bounding to her side;\nHer radiant beauty almost fixed him there;\nBut with main force as one that gripes with fear\nHe threw the fascination off and saw\nThe work before him. Soon his hand and knife\nReplaced the saddle firmer than before\nUpon the gentle horse; and then he turned\nTo mount the maiden. But bewilderment\nA moment lasted; for he knew not how\nWith stirrup-hand and steady arm to throne\nElastic on her steed the ascending maid:\nA moment only; for while yet she thanked\nNor yet had time to teach her further will\nAround her waist he put his brawny hands\nThat almost zoned her round; and like a child\nLifting her high he set her on the horse;\nWhence like a risen moon she smiled on him\nNor turned away although a radiant blush\nShone in her cheek and shadowed in her eyes.\nBut he was never sure if from her heart\nOr from the rosy sunset came the flush.\nAgain she thanked him while again he stood\nBewildered in her beauty. Not a word\nAnswered her words that flowed folded in tones\nRound which dissolving lambent music played\nLike dropping water in a silver cup;\nTill round the shoulder of the neighbouring hill\nSudden she disappeared. And he awoke\nAnd called himself hard names and turned and went\nAfter his horses bending too his head.\n\nAh God! when Beauty passes by the door\nAlthough she ne'er came in the house grows bare.\nShut shut the door; there's nothing in the house.\nWhy seems it always that it should be ours?\nA secret lies behind which Thou dost know\nAnd I can partly guess.\n\n                       But think not then\nThe holder of the plough had many sighs\nUpon his bed that night; or other dreams\nThan pleasant rose upon his view in sleep\nWithin the magic crystal of the soul;\nNor that the airy castles of his brain\nHad less foundation than the air admits.\nBut read my simple tale scarce worth the name;\nAnd answer if he gained not from the fair\nBeauty's best gift; and proved her not in sooth\nAn angel vision from a higher world.\n\nNot much of her I tell. Her changeful life\nWhere part the waters on the mountain ridge\nFlowed down the other side apart from his.\nHer tale hath wiled deep sighs on summer eves\nWhere in the ancient mysteries of woods\nWalketh a man who worships womanhood.\nSoon was she orphaned of such parent-haunts;\nSurrounded with dead glitter not the shine\nOf leaves in wind and sunlight; while the youth\nBreathed on as if a constant breaking dawn\nSent forth the new-born wind upon his brow;\nAnd knew the morning light was climbing up\nThe further hill-side--morning light which most\nThey say reveals the inner hues of earth.\nNow she was such as God had made her ere\nThe world had tried to spoil her; tried I say\nAnd half-succeeded failing utterly.\nFair was she frank and innocent as a child\nThat stares you in the eyes; fearless of ill\nBecause she knew it not; and brave withal\nBecause she drank the draught that maketh strong\nThe charmed country air. Her father's house--\nA Scottish laird was he of ancient name--\nStood only two miles off amid the hills;\nBut though she often passed alone as now\nThe youth had never seen her face before\nAnd might not twice. Yet was not once enough?\nIt left him not. She as the harvest moon\nThat goeth on her way and knoweth not\nThe fields of grain whose ripening ears she fills\nWith wealth of life and human joyfulness\nWent on and knew not of the influence\nShe left behind; yea never thought of him;\nSave at those times when all at once old scenes\nReturn uncalled with wonder that they come\nAmidst far other thoughts and other cares;\nSinking again into their ancient graves\nTill some far-whispered necromantic spell\nLoose them once more to wander for a space.\n\nAgain I say no fond romance of love\nNo argument of possibilities\nIf he were some one and she claimed his aid\nTurned his clear brain into a nest of dreams.\nAs soon he had sat down and twisted cords\nTo snare and carry home for daylight use\nSome woman-angel wandering half-seen\nOn moonlight wings o'er withered autumn fields.\nBut when he rose next morn and went abroad\n(The exultation of his new-found rank\nAlready settling into dignity)\nHe found the earth was beautiful. The sky\nWhich shone with expectation of the sun\nSomehow he knew not how was like her face.\nHe grieved almost to plough the daisies down;\nSomething they shared in common with that smile\nWherewith she crowned his manhood; and they fell\nBent in the furrow sometimes with their heads\nJust out imploringly. A hedgehog ran\nWith tangled mesh of bristling spikes and face\nHelplessly innocent across the field:\nHe let it run and blessed it as it ran.\nAt noon returning something drew his feet\nInto the barn. Entering he gazed and stood.\nThrough the rent roof alighting one sunbeam\nBlazing upon the straw one golden spot\nDulled all the yellow heap and sank far down\nLike flame inverted through the loose-piled mound\nCrossing the splendour with the shadow-straws\nIn lines innumerable. 'Twas so bright\nThe eye was cheated with a spectral smoke\nThat rose as from a fire. He never knew\nBefore how beautiful the sunlight was;\nThough he had seen it in the grassy fields\nAnd on the river and the ripening corn\nA thousand times. He threw him on the heap\nAnd gazing down into the glory-gulf\nDreamed as a boy half-sleeping by the fire;\nAnd dreaming rose and got his horses out.\n\nGod and not woman is the heart of all.\nBut she as priestess of the visible earth\nHolding the key herself most beautiful\nHad come to him and flung the portals wide.\nHe entered in: each beauty was a glass\nThat gleamed the woman back upon his view.\n\nAlready in these hours his growing soul\nPut forth the white tip of a floral bud\nEre long to be a crown-like shadowy flower.\nFor by his songs and joy in ancient tales\nHe showed the seed lay hidden in his heart\nA safe sure treasure hidden even from him\nAnd notwithstanding mellowing all his spring;\nUntil like sunshine with its genial power\nCame the fair maiden's face: the seed awoke.\nI need not follow him through many days;\nNor tell the joys that rose around his path\nMinistering pleasure for his labour's meed;\nNor how each morning was a boon to him;\nNor how the wind with nature's kisses fraught\nFlowed inward to his soul; nor how the flowers\nAsserted each an individual life\nA separate being for and in his thought;\nNor how the stormy days that intervened\nCalled forth his strength and songs that quelled their force;\nNor how in winter-time when thick the snow\nArmed the sad fields from gnawing of the frost\nAnd the low sun but skirted his far realms\nAnd sank in early night he took his place\nBeside the fire; and by the feeble lamp\nHead book on book; and lived in other lives\nAnd other needs and other climes than his;\nAnd added other beings thus to his.\nBut I must tell that love of knowledge grew\nWithin him to a passion and a power;\nTill through the night (all dark except the moon\nShone frosty o'er the lea or the white snow\nGave back all motes of light that else had sunk\nInto the thirsty earth) he bent his way\nOver the moors to where the little town\nLay gathered in the hollow. There the man\nWho taught the children all the shortened day\nTaught other scholars in the long fore-night;\nAnd youths who in the shop or in the barn\nOr at the loom had done their needful work\nCame to his schoolroom in the murky night\nAnd found the fire aglow the candles lit\nAnd the good master waiting for his men.\nHere mathematics wiled him to their heights;\nAnd strange consent of lines to form and law\nMade Euclid like a great romance of truth.\nThe master saw with wonder how the youth\nAll eagerly devoured the offered food\nAnd straightway longed to lead him; with that hope\nOf sympathy which urges him that knows\nTo multiply great knowledge by its gift;\nThat so two souls ere long may see one truth\nAnd turning see each others' faces shine.\nSo he proposed the classics; and the youth\nCaught at the offer; and for many a night\nWhen others lay and lost themselves in sleep\nHe groped his way with lexicon and rule\nThrough ancient deeds embalmed in Latin old\nOr poet-woods alive with gracious forms;\nWherein his knowledge of the English tongue\n(Through reading many books) much aided him--\nFor the soul's language is the same in all.\nAt length his progress through the master's word\nProud of his pupil reached the father's ears.\nGreat joy arose within him and he vowed\nIf caring sparing would accomplish it\nHe should to college and should have his fill\nOf that same learning.\n\n                      So to school he went\nInstead of to the plough; and ere a year\nHe wore the scarlet gown with the close sleeves.\n\nAwkward at first but with a dignity\nThat soon found fit embodiment in speech\nAnd gesture and address he made his way\nNot seeking it to the respect of youths\nIn whom respect is of the rarer gifts.\nLikewise by the consent of accidents\nMore than his worth society so called\nIn that great northern city to its rooms\nInvited him. He entered. Dazzled first\nNot only by the brilliance of the show\nIn lights and mirrors gems and crowded eyes;\nBut by the surface lights of many minds\nCut like rose-diamonds into many planes\nWhich catching up the wandering rays of fact\nReflected coloured tossed them here and there\nIn varied brilliance as if quite new-born\nFrom out the centre not from off the face--\nDazzled at first I say he soon began\nTo see how little thought could sparkle well\nAnd turn him even in the midst of talk\nBack to the silence of his homely toils.\nAround him still and ever hung an air\nBorn of the fields and plough and cart and scythe;\nA kind of clumsy grace in which gay girls\nSaw but the clumsiness; while those with light\nInstead of glitter in their quiet eyes\nSaw the grace too; yea sometimes when he talked\nSaw the grace only; and began at last\nAs he sought none to seek him in the crowd\n(After a maiden fashion) that they might\nHear him dress thoughts not pay poor compliments.\nYet seldom thus was he seduced from toil;\nOr if one eve his windows showed no light\nThe next they faintly gleamed in candle-shine\nTill far into the morning. And he won\nHonours among the first each session's close.\n\nAnd if increased familiarity\nWith open forms of ill not to be shunned\nWhere youths of all kinds meet endangered there\nA mind more willing to be pure than most--\nOft when the broad rich humour of a jest\nDid with its breezy force make radiant way\nFor pestilential vapours following--\nArose within his sudden silent mind\nThe maiden face that smiled and blushed on him;\nThat lady face insphered beyond his earth\nYet visible to him as any star\nThat shines unwavering. I cannot tell\nIn words the tenderness that glowed across\nHis bosom--burned it clean in will and thought;\n\"Shall that sweet face be blown by laughter rude\nOut of the soul where it has deigned to come\nBut will not stay what maidens may not hear?\"\nHe almost wept for shame that those two thoughts\nShould ever look each other in the face\nMeeting in _his_ house. Thus he made to her\nFor love an offering of purity.\n\nAnd if the homage that he sometimes found\nNew to the country lad conveyed in smiles\nAssents and silent listenings when he spoke\nThreatened yet more his life's simplicity;\nAn antidote of nature ever came\nEven nature's self. For in the summer months\nHis former haunts and boyhood's circumstance\nReceived him back within old influences.\nAnd he too noble to despise the past\nToo proud to be ashamed of manhood's toil\nToo wise to fancy that a gulf lay wide\nBetwixt the labouring hand and thinking brain\nOr that a workman was no gentleman\nBecause a workman clothed himself again\nIn his old garments took the hoe or spade\nOr sowing sheet or covered in the grain\nSmoothing with harrows what the plough had ridged.\nWith ever fresher joy he hailed the fields\nReturning still with larger powers of sight:\nEach time he knew them better than before\nAnd yet their sweetest aspect was the old.\nHis labour kept him true to life and fact\nCasting out worldly judgments false desires\nAnd vain distinctions. Ever at his toil\nNew thoughts arose; which when still night awoke\nHe ever sought like stars with instruments;\nBy science or by wise philosophy\nBridging the gulf between them and the known;\nAnd thus preparing for the coming months\nWhen in the time of snow old Scotland's sons\nReap wisdom in the silence of the year.\n\nHis sire was proud of him; and most of all\nBecause his learning did not make him proud.\nA wise man builds not much upon his lore.\nThe neighbours asked what he would make his son.\n\"I'll make a man of him\" the old man said;\n\"And for the rest just what he likes himself.\nBut as he is my only son I think\nHe'll keep the old farm joined to the old name;\nAnd I shall go to the churchyard content\nLeaving my name amongst my fellow men\nAs safe thank God as if I bore it still.\"\nBut sons are older than their sires full oft\nIn the new world that cometh after this.\n\nSo four years long his life went to and fro\nBetwixt the scarlet gown and rough blue coat;\nThe garret study and the wide-floored barn;\nThe wintry city and the sunny fields.\nIn each his quiet mind was well content\nBecause he was himself where'er he was.\n\nNot in one channel flowed his seeking thoughts;\nTo no profession did he ardent turn:\nHe knew his father's wish--it was his own.\n\"Why should a man\" he said \"when knowledge grows\nLeave therefore the old patriarchal life\nAnd seek distinction in the noise of men?\"\nAnd yet he turned his face on every side;\nWent with the doctors to the lecture-room\nAnd saw the inner form of man laid bare;\nWent with the chymists where the skilful hand\nRevering laws higher than Nature's self\nMakes Nature do again before our eyes\nAnd in a moment what in many years\nAnd in the veil of vastness and lone deeps\nShe laboureth at alway then best content\nWhen man inquires into her secret ways;\nYea turned his asking eye on every source\nWhence knowledge floweth for the hearts of men\nKneeling at some and drinking freely there.\nAnd at the end when he had gained the right\nTo sit with covered head before the rank\nOf black-gowned senators; and all these men\nWere ready at a word to speed him on\nProud of their pupil towards any goal\nWhere he might fix his eye; he took his books\nWhat little of his gown and cap remained\nAnd leaving with a sigh the ancient walls\nWith the old stony crown unchanging grey\nAmidst the blandishments of airy Spring\nHe sought for life the lone ancestral farm.\n\nWith simple gladness met him on the road\nHis grey-haired father elder brother now.\nFew words were spoken little welcome said\nBut much was understood on either side.\nIf with a less delight he brought him home\nThan he that met the prodigal returned\nYet with more confidence more certain joy;\nAnd with the leaning pride that old men feel\nIn young strong arms that draw their might from them\nHe led him to the house. His sister there\nWhose kisses were not many but whose eyes\nWere full of watchfulness and hovering love\nSet him beside the fire in the old place\nAnd heaped the table with best country fare.\nAnd when the night grew deep the father rose\nAnd led his son (who wondered why they went\nAnd in the darkness made a tortuous path\nThrough the corn-ricks) to an old loft above\nThe stable where his horses rested still.\nEntering he saw some plan-pursuing hand\nHad been at work. The father leading on\nAcross the floor heaped up with waiting grain\nOpened a door. An unexpected light\nFlashed on them from a cheerful lamp and fire\nThat burned alone as in a fairy tale.\nAnd lo! a little room white-curtained bed\nAn old arm-chair bookshelves and writing desk\nAnd some old prints of deep Virgilian woods\nAnd one a country churchyard on the walls.\nThe young man stood and spoke not. The old love\nSeeking and finding incarnation new\nDrew from his heart as from the earth the sun\nWarm tears. The good the fatherly old man\nHonouring in his son the simple needs\nWhich his own bounty had begot in him\nThus gave him loneliness for silent thought\nA simple refuge he could call his own.\nHe grasped his hand and shook it; said good night\nAnd left him glad with love. Faintly beneath\nThe horses stamped and drew the lengthening chain.\n\nThree sliding years with gently blending change\nWent round 'mid work of hands and brain and heart.\nHe laboured as before; though when he would\nWith privilege he took from hours of toil\nWhen nothing pressed; and read within his room\nOr wandered through the moorland to the hills;\nThere stood upon the apex of the world\nWith a great altar-stone of rock beneath\nAnd looked into the wide abyss of blue\nThat roofed him round; and then with steady foot\nDescended to the world and worthy cares.\n\nAnd on the Sunday father daughter son\nWalked to the country church across the fields.\nIt was a little church and plain almost\nTo ugliness yet lacking not a charm\nTo him who sat there when a little boy.\nAnd the low mounds with long grass waving on\nWere quite as solemn as great marble tombs.\nAnd on the sunny afternoons across\nThis well-sown field of death when forth they came\nWith the last psalm still lingering in their hearts\nHe looked and wondered where the heap would rise\nThat rested on the arch of his dead breast.\nBut in the gloom and rain he turned aside\nAnd let the drops soak through the sinking clay--\nWhat mattered it to him?\n\n                        And as they walked\nTogether home the father loved to hear\nThe new streams pouring from his son's clear well.\nThe old man clung not only to the old;\nNor bowed the young man only to the new;\nYet as they walked full often he would say\nHe liked not much what he had heard that morn.\nHe said these men believed the past alone;\nHonoured those Jewish times as they were Jews;\nAnd had no ears for this poor needy hour\nThat up and down the centuries doth go\nLike beggar boy that wanders through the streets\nWith hand held out to any passer by;\nAnd yet God made it and its many cries.\n\nHe used to say: \"I take the work that comes\nAll ready to my hand. The lever set\nI grasp and heave withal. Or rather I\nLove where I live and yield me to the will\nThat made the needs about me. It may be\nI find them nearer to my need of work\nThan any other choice. I would not choose\nTo lack a relish for the thing that God\nThinks worth. Among my own I will be good;\nA helper to all those that look to me.\nThis farm is God's as much as yonder town;\nThese men and maidens kine and horses his;\nAnd need his laws of truth made rules of fact;\nOr else the earth is not redeemed from ill.\"\nHe spoke not often; but he ruled and did.\nNo ill was suffered there by man or beast\nThat he could help; no creature fled from him;\nAnd when he slew 'twas with a sudden death\nLike God's benignant lightning. For he knew\nThat God doth make the beasts and loves them well\nAnd they are sacred. Sprung from God as we\nThey are our brethren in a lower kind;\nAnd in their face he saw the human look.\nThey said: \"Men look like different animals;\"\nBut he: \"The animals are like to men\nSome one and some another.\" Cruelty\nHe said would need no other fiery hell\nThan that the ghosts of the sad beasts should come\nAnd crowding silent all their heads one way\nStare the ill man to madness.\n\n                             By degrees\nThey knew not how men trusted in him. When\nHe spoke his word had all the force of deeds\nThat lay unsaid within him. To be good\nIs more than holy words or definite acts;\nEmbodying itself unconsciously\nIn simple forms of human helpfulness\nAnd understanding of the need that prays.\nAnd when he read the weary tales of crime\nAnd wretchedness and white-faced children sad\nWith hunger and neglect and cruel words\nHe would walk sadly for an afternoon\nWith head down-bent and pondering footstep slow;\nAnd to himself conclude: \"The best I can\nFor the great world is just the best I can\nFor this my world. The influence will go\nIn widening circles to the darksome lanes\nIn London's self.\" When a philanthropist\nSaid pompously: \"With your great gifts you ought\nTo work for the great world not spend yourself\nOn common labours like a common man;\"\nHe answered him: \"The world is in God's hands.\nThis part he gives to me; for which my past\nBuilt up on loves inherited hath made\nMe fittest. Neither will He let me think\nPrimeval godlike work too low to need\nFor its perfection manhood's noblest powers\nAnd deepest knowledge far beyond my gifts.\nAnd for the crowds of men in whom a soul\nCries through the windows of their hollow eyes\nFor bare humanity and leave to grow--\nWould I could help them! But all crowds are made\nOf individuals; and their grief and pain\nAnd thirst and hunger all are of the one\nNot of the many. And the power that helps\nEnters the individual and extends\nThence in a thousand gentle influences\nTo other hearts. It is not made one's own\nBy laying hold of an allotted share\nOf general good divided faithfully.\nNow here I labour whole upon the place\nWhere they have known me from my childhood up.\nI know the individual man; and he\nKnows me. If there is power in me to help\nIt goeth forth beyond the present will\nClothing itself in very common deeds\nOf any humble day's necessity:\n--I would not always consciously do good;\nNot always feel a helper of the men\nWho make me full return for my poor deeds\n(Which I _must_ do for my own highest sake\nIf I forgot my brethren for themselves)\nBy human trust and confidence of eyes\nThat look me in the face and hands that do\nMy work at will--'tis more than I deserve.\nBut in the city with a few lame words\nAnd a few scanty handfuls of weak coin\nMisunderstood or at the best unknown\nI should toil on and seldom reach the mail.\nAnd if I leave the thing that lieth next\nTo go and do the thing that is afar\nI take the very strength out of my deed\nSeeking the needy not for pure need's sake.\"\nThus he. The world-wise schemer for the good\nHeld his poor peace and left him to his way.\n\nWhat of the vision now? the vision fair\nSent forth to meet him when at eve he went\nHome from his first day's ploughing? Oft she passed\nSlowly on horseback in all kinds of dreams;\nFor much he dreamed and loved his dreaming well.\nNor woke he from such dreams with vain regret;\nBut saying \"I have seen that face once more\"\nHe smiled with his eyes and rose to work.\nNor did he turn aside from other maids\nBut loved the woman-faces and dear eyes;\nAnd sometimes thought \"One day I wed a maid\nAnd make her mine;\" but never came the maid\nOr never came the hour that he might say\n\"I wed this maid.\" And ever when he read\nA tale of lofty aim or when the page\nOf history spoke of woman very fair\nOr wondrous good her face arose and stayed\nThe face for ever of that storied page.\n\nMeantime how fared the lady? She had wed\nOne of those common men who serve as ore\nFor the gold grains to lie in. Virgin gold\nLay hidden there--no richer was the dross.\nShe went to gay assemblies not content;\nFor she had found no hearts that struck with hers\nSounded one chord. She went and danced or sat\nAnd listlessly conversed; or if at home\nRead the new novel wishing all the time\nFor something better; though she knew not what\nOr how to search for it.\n\n                        What had she felt\nIf through the rhythmic motion of light forms\nA vision had arisen; as when of old\nThe minstrel's art laid bare the seer's eye\nAnd showed him plenteous waters in the waste?\nIf she had seen her ploughman-lover go\nWith his great stride across some lonely field\nBeneath the dark blue vault ablaze with stars\nAnd lift his full eyes to earth's radiant roof\nIn gladness that the roof was yet a floor\nFor other feet to tread for his one day?\nOr the emerging vision might reveal\nHim in his room with space-compelling mind\nPursue upon his slate some planet's course;\nOr read and justify the poet's wrath\nOr wise man's slow conclusion; or in dreams\nAll gently bless her with a trembling voice\nFor that old smile that withered nevermore\nThat woke him smiled him into what he is;\nOr kneeling cry to God for better still.\nWould those dark eyes have beamed with darker light?\nWould that fair soul all tired of emptiness\nHave risen from the couch of its unrest\nAnd looked to heaven again again believed\nIn God's realities of life and fact?\nWould not her soul have sung unto itself\nIn secret joy too good for that vain throng:\n\"I have a friend a ploughman who is wise\nAnd knoweth God and goodness and fair faith;\nWho needeth not the outward shows of things\nBut worships the unconquerable truth:\nAnd this man loveth me; I will be proud\nAnd humble--would he love me if he knew?\"\n\nIn the third year a heavy harvest fell\nFull filled beneath the reaping-hook and scythe.\nThe men and maidens in the scorching heat\nHeld on their toil lightened by song and jest;\nResting at mid-day and from brimming bowl\nDrinking brown ale and white abundant milk;\nUntil the last ear fell and stubble stood\nWhere waved the forests of the murmuring corn;\nAnd o'er the land rose piled the tent-like shocks\nAs of an army resting in array\nOf tent by tent rank following on rank;\nWaiting until the moon should have her will\nOf ripening on the ears.\n\n                        And all went well.\nThe grain was fully ripe. The harvest carts\nWent forth broad-platformed for the towering load\nWith frequent passage 'twixt homeyard and field.\nAnd half the oats already hid their tops\nOf countless spray-hung grains--their tops by winds\nSwayed oft and ringing rustling contact sweet;\nMade heavy oft by slow-combining dews\nOr beaten earthward by the pelting rains;\nRising again in breezes to the sun\nAnd bearing all things till the perfect time--\nHad hid I say this growth of sun and air\nWithin the darkness of the towering stack;\nWhen in the north low billowy clouds appeared\nBlue-based white-topped at close of afternoon;\nAnd in the west dark masses plashed with blue\nWith outline vague of misty steep and dell\nClomb o'er the hill-tops; there was thunder there.\nThe air was sultry. But the upper sky\nWas clear and radiant.\n\n                      Downward went the sun;\nDown low behind the low and sullen clouds\nThat walled the west; and down below the hills\nThat lay beneath them hid. Uprose the moon\nAnd looked for silence in her moony fields\nBut there she found it not. The staggering cart\nLike an o'erladen beast crawled homeward still\nReturning light and low. The laugh broke yet\nThat lightning of the soul from cloudless skies\nThough not so frequent now that labour passed\nIts natural hour. Yet on the labour went\nStraining to beat the welkin-climbing toil\nOf the huge rain-clouds heavy with their floods.\nSleep like enchantress old soon sided with\nThe crawling clouds and flung benumbing spells\nOn man and horse. The youth that guided home\nThe ponderous load of sheaves higher than wont\nDaring the slumberous lightning with a start\nAwoke by falling full against the wheel\nThat circled slow after the sleepy horse.\nYet none would yield to soft-suggesting sleep\nOr leave the last few shocks; for the wild rain\nWould catch thereby the skirts of Harvest-home\nAnd hold her lingering half-way in the storm.\n\nThe scholar laboured with his men all night.\nNot that he favoured quite this headlong race\nWith Nature. He would rather say: \"The night\nIs sent for sleep we ought to sleep in it\nAnd leave the clouds to God. Not every storm\nThat climbeth heavenward overwhelms the earth.\nAnd if God wills 'tis better as he wills;\nWhat he takes from us never can be lost.\"\nBut the old farmer ordered; and the son\nWent manful to the work and held his peace.\n\nThe last cart homeward went oppressed with sheaves\nJust as a moist dawn blotted pale the east\nAnd the first drops fell overfed with mist\nO'ergrown and helpless. Darker grew the morn.\nUpstraining racks of clouds tumultuous borne\nUpon the turmoil of opposing winds\nMet in the zenith. And the silence ceased:\nThe lightning brake and flooded all the earth\nAnd its great roar of billows followed it.\nThe deeper darkness drank the light again\nAnd lay unslaked. But ere the darkness came\nIn the full revelation of the flash\nHe saw along the road borne on a horse\nPowerful and gentle the sweet lady go\nWhom years agone he saw for evermore.\n\"Ah me!\" he said; \"my dreams are come for me\nNow they shall have their time.\" And home he went\nAnd slept and moaned and woke and raved and wept.\nThrough all the net-drawn labyrinth of his brain\nThe fever raged like pent internal fire.\nHis father soon was by him; and the hand\nOf his one sister soothed him. Days went by.\nAs in a summer evening after rain\nHe woke to sweet quiescent consciousness;\nEnfeebled much but with a new-born life.\n\nAs slow the weeks passed he recovered strength;\nAnd ere the winter came seemed strong once more.\nBut the brown hue of health had not returned\nOn his thin face; although a keener fire\nBurned in his larger eyes; and in his cheek\nThe mounting blood glowed radiant (summoning force\nSometimes unbidden) with a sunset red.\n\nBefore its time a biting frost set in;\nAnd gnawed with fangs of cold his shrinking life;\nAnd the disease so common to the north\nWas born of outer cold and inner heat.\nOne morn his sister entering saw he slept;\nBut in his hand he held a handkerchief\nSpotted with crimson. White with terror she\nStood motionless and staring. Startled next\nBy her own pallor when she raised her eyes\nSeen in the glass she moved at last. He woke;\nAnd seeing her dismay said with a smile\n\"Blood-red was evermore my favourite hue\nAnd see I have it in me; that is all.\"\nShe shuddered; and he tried to jest no more;\nAnd from that hour looked Death full in the face.\n\nWhen first he saw the red blood outward leap\nAs if it sought again the fountain heart\nWhence it had flowed to fill the golden bowl;\nNo terror but a wild excitement seized\nHis spirit; now the pondered mystery\nOf the unseen would fling its portals wide\nAnd he would enter one of the awful dead;\nWhom men conceive as ghosts that fleet and pine\nBereft of weight and half their valued lives;--\nBut who he knew must live intenser life\nHaving through matter all illumed with sense\nFlaming like Horeb's bush with present soul\nAnd by the contact with a thousand souls\nEach in the present glory of a shape\nSucked so much honey from the flower o' the world\nAnd kept the gain and cast the means aside;\nAnd now all eye all ear all sense perhaps;\nTransformed transfigured yet the same life-power\nThat moulded first the visible to its use.\nSo like a child he was that waits the show\nWhile yet the panting lights restrained burn\nAt half height and the theatre is full.\n\nBut as the days went on they brought sad hours\nWhen he would sit his hands upon his knees\nDrooping and longing for the wine of life.\nAh! now he learned what new necessities\nCome when the outer sphere of life is riven\nAnd casts distorted shadows on the soul;\nWhile the poor soul not yet complete in God\nCannot with inward light burn up the shades\nAnd laugh at seeming that is not the fact.\nFor God who speaks to man on every side\nSending his voices from the outer world\nGlorious in stars and winds and flowers and waves\nAnd from the inner world of things unseen\nIn hopes and thoughts and deep assurances\nNot seldom ceases outward speech awhile\nThat the inner isled in calm may clearer sound;\nOr calling through dull storms proclaim a rest\nOne centre fixed amid conflicting spheres;\nAnd thus the soul calm in itself become\nAble to meet and cope with outward things\nWhich else would overwhelm it utterly;\nAnd that the soul saying _I will the light_\nMay in its absence yet grow light itself\nAnd man's will glow the present will of God\nSelf-known and yet divine.\n\n                           Ah gracious God!\nDo with us what thou wilt thou glorious heart!\nThou art the God of them that grow no less\nThan them that are; and so we trust in thee\nFor what we shall be and in what we are.\n\nYet in the frequent pauses of the light\nWhen fell the drizzling thaw or flaky snow;\nOr when the heaped-up ocean of still foam\nReposed upon the tranced earth breathing low;\nHis soul was like a frozen lake beneath\nThe clear blue heaven reflecting it so dim\nThat he could scarce believe there was a heaven;\nAnd feared that beauty might be but a toy\nInvented by himself in happier moods.\n\"For\" said he \"if my mind can dim the fair\nWhy should it not enhance the fairness too?\"\nBut then the poor mind lay itself all dim\nAnd ruffled with the outer restlessness\nOf striving death and life. And a tired man\nMay drop his eyelids on the visible world\nTo whom no dreams when fancy flieth free\nWill bring the sunny excellence of day;\nNor will his utmost force increase his sight.\n'Tis easy to destroy not so to make.\nNo keen invention lays the strata deep\nOf ancient histories; or sweeps the sea\nWith purple shadows and blue breezes' tracks\nOr rosy memories of the down-gone sun.\nAnd if God means no beauty in these shows\nBut drops them helpless shadows from his sun\nAh me my heart! thou needst another God.\nOh! lack and doubt and fear can only come\nBecause of plenty confidence and love:\nWithout the mountain there were no abyss.\nOur spirits inward cast upon themselves\nBecause the delicate ether which doth make\nThe mediator with the outer world\nIs troubled and confused with stormy pain;\nNot glad because confined to shuttered rooms\nWhich let the sound of slanting rain be heard\nBut show no sparkling sunlight on the drops\nOr ancient rainbow dawning in the west;--\nCast on themselves I say nor finding there\nThe thing they need because God has not come\nAnd claiming all their Human his Divine\nRevealed himself in all their inward parts\nGo wandering up and down a dreary house.\nThus reasoned he. Yet up and down the house\nHe wandered moaning. Till his soul and frame\nIn painful rest compelled full oft lay still\nAnd suffered only. Then all suddenly\nA light would break from forth an inward well--\nGod shone within him and the sun arose.\nAnd to its windows went the soul and looked:--\nLo! o'er the bosom of the outspread earth\nFlowed the first waves of sunrise rippling on.\n\nMuch gathered he of patient faith from off\nThese gloomy heaths this land of mountains dark\nBy moonlight only like the sorcerer's weeds;\nAs testify these written lines of his\nFound on his table when his empty chair\nStood by the wall with yet a history\nClinging around it for the old man's eyes.\n\n        I am weary and something lonely;\n          And can only think think.\n        If there were some water only\n          That a spirit might drink drink!\n            And rise\n            With light in the eyes\n        And a crown of hope on the brow;\n          And walk in outgoing gladness--\n          Not sit in an inward sadness--\n            As now!\n\n        But Lord thy child will be sad\n          As sad as it pleaseth thee;\n        Will sit not needing to be glad\n          Till thou bid sadness flee;\n            And drawing near\n            With a simple cheer\n           Speak one true word to me.\n\nAnother song in a low minor key\nFrom awful holy calm as this from grief\nI weave a silken flower into my web\nThat goes straight on with simply crossing lines\nFloating few colours upward to the sight.\n\n        Ah holy midnight of the soul\n          When stars alone are high;\n        When winds are dead or at their goal\n          And sea-waves only sigh!\n\n        Ambition faints from out the will;\n          Asleep sad longing lies;\n        All hope of good all fear of ill\n          All need of action dies;\n\n        Because God is; and claims the life\n          He kindled in thy brain;\n        And thou in Him rapt far from strife\n          Diest and liv'st again.\n\nIt was a changed and wintry time to him;\nBut visited by April airs and scents\nThat came with sudden presence unforetold;\nAs brushed from off the outer spheres of spring\nIn the new singing world by winds of sighs\nThat wandering swept across the glad _To be_.\nStrange longings that he never knew till now\nA sense of want yea of an infinite need\nCried out within him--rather moaned than cried.\nAnd he would sit a silent hour and gaze\nUpon the distant hills with dazzling snow\nUpon their peaks and thence adown their sides\nStreaked vaporous or starred in solid blue.\nAnd then a shadowy sense arose in him\nAs if behind those world-inclosing hills\nThere sat a mighty woman with a face\nAs calm as life when its intensity\nPushes it nigh to death waiting for him\nTo make him grand for ever with a kiss\nAnd send him silent through the toning worlds.\n\nThe father saw him waning. The proud sire\nBeheld his pride go drooping in the cold\nDown down to the warm earth; and gave God thanks\nThat he was old. But evermore the son\nLooked up and smiled as he had heard strange news\nAcross the waste of primrose-buds and flowers.\nThen again to his father he would come\nSeeking for comfort as a troubled child\nAnd with the same child's hope of comfort there.\nSure there is one great Father in the heavens\nSince every word of good from fathers' lips\nFalleth with such authority although\nThey are but men as we: God speaks in them.\nSo this poor son who neared the unknown death\nTook comfort in his father's tenderness\nAnd made him strong to die. One day he came\nAnd said: \"What think you father is it hard\nThis dying?\" \"Well my boy\" he said \"We'll try\nAnd make it easy with the present God.\nBut as I judge though more by hope than sight\nIt seemeth harder to the lookers on\nThan him that dieth. It may be each breath\nThat they would call a gasp seems unto him\nA sigh of pleasure; or at most the sob\nWherewith the unclothed spirit step by step\nWades forth into the cool eternal sea.\nI think my boy death has two sides to it\nOne sunny and one dark; as this round earth\nIs every day half sunny and half dark.\nWe on the dark side call the mystery _death_;\nThey on the other looking down in light\nWait the glad birth with other tears than ours.\"\n\"Be near me father when I die;\" he said.\n\"I will my boy until a better sire\nTakes your hand out of mine and I shall say:\nI give him back to thee; Oh! love him God;\nFor he needs more than I can ever be.\nAnd then my son mind and be near in turn\nWhen my time comes; you in the light beyond\nAnd knowing all about it; I all dark.\"\n\nAnd so the days went on until the green\nShone through the snow in patches very green:\nFor though the snow was white yet the green shone.\nAnd hope of life awoke within his heart;\nFor the spring drew him warm soft budding spring\nWith promises. The father better knew.\nGod give us heaven. Remember our poor hearts.\nWe never grasp the zenith of the time;\nWe find no spring except in winter prayers.\n\nNow he who strode a king across his fields\nCrept slowly through the breathings of the spring;\nAnd sometimes wept in secret that the earth\nWhich dwelt so near his heart with all its suns\nAnd moons and maidens soon would lie afar\nAcross some unknown sure-dividing waste.\nYet think not though I fall upon the sad\nAnd lingering listen to the fainting tones\nBefore I strike new chords that seize the old\nAnd waft their essence up the music-stair--\nThink not that he was always sad nor dared\nTo look the blank unknown full in the void:\nFor he had hope in God the growth of years\nPonderings and aspirations from a child\nAnd prayers and readings and repentances.\nSomething within him ever sought to come\nAt peace with something deeper in him still.\nSome sounds sighed ever for a harmony\nWith other deeper fainter tones that still\nDrew nearer from the unknown depths wherein\nThe Individual goeth out in God\nAnd smoothed the discord ever as they grew.\nNow he went back the way the music came\nHoping some nearer sign of God at hand;\nAnd most of all to see the very face\nThat in Judea once at supper time\nArose a heaven of tenderness above\nThe face of John who leaned upon the breast\nSoon to lie down in its last weariness.\n\nAnd as the spring went on his budding life\nSwelled up and budded towards the invisible\nBursting the earthy mould wherein it lay.\nHe never thought of churchyards as before\nWhen he was strong; but ever looked above\nAway from the green earth to the blue sky\nAnd thanked God that he died not in the cold.\n\"For\" said he \"I would rather go abroad\nWhen the sun shines and birds are happy here.\nFor though it may be we shall know no place\nBut only mighty realms of making thought\n(Not living in creation any more\nBut evermore creating our own worlds)\nYet still it seems as if I had to go\nInto the sea of air that floats and heaves\nAnd swings its massy waves around our earth\nAnd may feel wet to the unclothed soul;\nAnd I would rather go when it is full\nOf light and blueness than when grey and fog\nThicken it with the steams of the old earth.\nNow in the first of summer I shall die;\nLying mayhap at sunset sinking asleep\nAnd going with the light and from the dark;\nAnd when the earth is dark they'll say: 'He is dead;'\nBut I shall say: 'Ah God! I live and love;\nThe earth is fair but this is fairer still;\nMy dear ones they were very dear; but now\nThe past is past; for they are dearer still.'\nSo I shall go in starlight it may be\nOr lapt in moonlight ecstasies to seek\nThe heart of all the man of all my friend;\nWhom I shall know my own beyond all loves\nBecause he makes all loving true and deep;\nAnd I live on him in him he in me.\"\n\nThe weary days and nights had taught him much;\nHad sent him as a sick child creeps along\nUntil he hides him in his mother's breast\nSeeking for God. For all he knew before\nSeemed as he knew it not. He needed now\nTo feel God's arms around him hold him close\nClose to his heart ere he could rest an hour.\nAnd God was very good to him he said.\n\nAh God! we need the winter as the spring;\nAnd thy poor children knowing thy great heart\nAnd that thou bearest thy large share of grief\nBecause thou lovest goodness more than joy\nIn them thou lovest--so dost let them grieve\nWill cease to vex thee with their peevish cries\nWill look and smile though they be sorrowful;\nAnd not the less pray for thy help when pain\nIs overstrong coming to thee for rest.\nOne day we praise thee for without the pain.\n\nOne night as oft he lay and could not sleep.\nHis soul was like an empty darkened room\nThrough which strange pictures pass from the outer world;\nWhile regnant will lay passive and looked on.\nBut the eye-tube through which the shadows came\nWas turned towards the past. One after one\nArose old scenes old sorrows old delights.\nAh God! how sad are all things that grow old;\nEven the rose-leaves have a mournful scent\nAnd old brown letters are more sad than graves;\nOld kisses lie about the founts of tears\nLike autumn leaves around the winter wells;\nAnd yet they cannot die. A smile once smiled\nIs to eternity a smile--no less;\nAnd that which smiles and kisses liveth still;\nAnd thou canst do great wonders Wonderful!\n\nAt length as ever in such vision-hours\nCame the bright maiden riding the great horse.\nAnd then at once the will sprang up awake\nAnd like a necromantic sage forbade\nWhat came unbidden to depart at will.\nSo on that form he rested his sad thoughts\nTill he began to wonder what her lot;\nHow she had fared in spinning history\nInto a psyche-cradle where to die;\nAnd then emerge--what butterfly? pure white\nWith silver dust of feathers on its wings?\nOr that dull red seared with its ebon spots?\nAnd then he thought: \"I know some women fail\nAnd cease to be so very beautiful.\nAnd I have heard men rave of certain eyes\nIn which I could not rest a moment's space.\"\nStraightway the fount of possibilities\nBegan to gurgle under in his soul.\nAnon the lava-stream burst forth amain\nAnd glowed and scorched and blasted as it flowed.\nFor purest souls sometimes have direst fears\nIn ghost-hours when the shadow of the earth\nIs cast on half her children from the sun\nWho is afar and busy with the rest.\n\"If my high lady be but only such\nAs some men say of women--very pure\nWhen dressed in white and shining in men's eyes\nAnd with the wavings of great unborn wings\nAround them in the aether of the souls\nFelt at the root where senses meet in one\nLike dim-remembered airs and rhymes and hues;\nBut when alone at best a common thing\nWith earthward thoughts and feet that are of earth!\nAh no--it cannot be! She is of God.\nBut then fair things may perish; higher life\nGives deeper death; fair gifts make fouler faults:\nWomen themselves--I dare not think the rest.\nAnd then they say that in her London world\nThey have other laws and judgments than in ours.\"\nAnd so the thoughts walked up and down his soul\nAnd found at last a spot wherein to rest\nBuilding a resolution for the day.\n\nBut next day and the next he was too worn\nWith the unrest of this chaotic night--\nAs if a man had sprung to life before\nThe spirit of God moved on the waters' face\nAnd made his dwelling ready who in pain\nHimself untuned groaned for a harmony\nFor order and for law around his life--\nToo tired he was to do as he had planned.\nBut on the next a genial south-born wind\nWaved the blue air beneath the golden sun\nBringing glad news of summer from the south.\nInto his little room the bright rays shone\nAnd darting through the busy blazing fire\nTurning it ghostly pale slew it almost;\nAs the great sunshine of the further life\nQuenches the glow of this and giveth death.\nHe had lain gazing at the wondrous strife\nAnd strange commingling of the sun and fire\nLike spiritual and vital energies\nWhereof the one doth bear the other first\nAnd then destroys it for a better birth;\nAnd now he rose to help the failing fire\nBecause the sunshine came not near enough\nTo do for both. And then he clothed himself\nAnd sat him down betwixt the sun and fire\nAnd got him ink and paper and began\nAnd wrote with earnest dying heart as thus.\n\"Lady I owe thee much. Nay do not look\nTo find my name; for though I write it here\nI date as from the churchyard where I lie\nWhilst thou art reading; and thou know'st me not.\nI dare to write because I am crowned by death\nThy equal. If my boldness should offend\nI pure in my intent hide with the ghosts\nWhere thou wilt never meet me until thou\nKnowest that death like God doth make of one.\n\n\"But pardon lady. Ere I had begun\nMy thoughts moved towards thee with a gentle flow\nThat bore a depth of waters. When I took\nMy pen to write they rushed into a gulf\nPrecipitate and foamy. Can it be\nThat death who humbles all hath made me proud?\nLady thy loveliness hath walked my brain\nAs if I were thy heritage in sooth\nBequeathed from sires beyond all story's reach.\nFor I have loved thee from afar and long;\nJoyous in having seen what lifted me\nBy very power to see above myself.\nThy beauty hath made beautiful my life;\nThy virtue made mine strong to be itself.\nThy form hath put on every changing dress\nOf name and circumstance and history\nThat so the life dumb in the wondrous page\nRecording woman's glory might come forth\nAnd be the living fact to longing eyes--\nThou thou essential womanhood to me;\nAfar as angels or the sainted dead\nYet near as loveliness can haunt a man\nAnd taking any shape for every need.\n\n\"Years many years have passed since the first time\nWhich was the last I saw thee. What have they\nMade or unmade in thee? I ask myself.\nO lovely in my memory! art thou\nAs lovely in thyself? Thy features then\nSaid what God made thee; art thou such indeed?\nForgive my boldness lady; I am dead;\nAnd dead men may cry loud they make no noise.\n\n\"I have a prayer to make thee--hear the dead.\nLady for God's sake be as beautiful\nAs that white form that dwelleth in my heart;\nYea better still as that ideal Pure\nThat waketh in thee when thou prayest God\nOr helpest thy poor neighbour. For myself\nI pray. For if I die and find that she\nMy woman-glory lives in common air\nIs not so very radiant after all\nMy sad face will afflict the calm-eyed ghosts\nNot used to see such rooted sadness there\nAt least in fields where I may hope to walk\nAnd find good company. Upon my knees\nI could implore thee--justify my faith\nIn womanhood's white-handed nobleness\nAnd thee its revelation unto me.\n\n\"But I bethink me lady. If thou turn\nThy thoughts upon thyself for the great sake\nOf purity and conscious whiteness' self\nThou wilt but half succeed. The other half\nIs to forget the first and all thyself\nQuenching thy moonlight in the blaze of day;\nTurning thy being full unto thy God;\nWhere shouldst thou quite forget the name of Truth\nYet thou wouldst be a pure twice holy child\n(Twice born of God once of thy own pure will\nArising at the calling Father's voice)\nDoing the right with sweet unconsciousness;\nHaving God in thee a completer soul\nBe sure than thou alone; thou not the less\nComplete in choice and individual life\nSince that which sayeth _I_ doth call him _Sire._\n\n\"Lady I die--the Father holds me up.\nIt is not much to thee that I should die;\n(How should it be? for thou hast never looked\nDeep in my eyes as I once looked in thine)\nBut it is much that He doth hold me up.\n\n\"I thank thee lady for a gentle look\nThou lettest fall upon me long ago.\nThe same sweet look be possible to thee\nFor evermore;--I bless thee with thine own\nAnd say farewell and go into my grave--\nNay nay into the blue heaven of my hopes.\"\n\nThen came his name in full and then the name\nOf the green churchyard where he hoped to lie.\nAnd then he laid him back weary and said:\n\"O God! I am only an attempt at life.\nSleep falls again ere I am full awake.\nLife goeth from me in the morning hour.\nI have seen nothing clearly; felt no thrill\nOf pure emotion save in dreams wild dreams;\nAnd sometimes when I looked right up to thee.\nI have been proud of knowledge when the flame\nOf Truth high Truth but flickered in my soul.\nOnly at times in lonely midnight hours\nWhen in my soul the stars came forth and brought\nNew heights of silence quelling all my sea\nHave I beheld clear truth apart from form\nAnd known myself a living lonely thought\nIsled in the hyaline of Truth alway.\nI have not reaped earth's harvest O my God;\nHave gathered but a few poor wayside flowers\nHarebells red poppies closing pimpernels--\nAll which thou hast invented beautiful God\nTo gather by the way for comforting.\nHave I aimed proudly therefore aimed too low\nStriving for something visible in my thought\nAnd not the unseen thing hid far in thine?\nMake me content to be a primrose-flower\nAmong thy nations; that the fair truth hid\nIn the sweet primrose enter into me\nAnd I rejoice an individual soul\nReflecting thee; as truly then divine\nAs if I towered the angel of the sun.\nAll in the night the glowing worm hath given\nMe keener joy than a whole heaven of stars:\nThou camest in the worm more near me then.\nNor do I think were I that green delight\nI'd change to be the shadowy evening star.\nAh make me Father anything thou wilt\nSo be thou will it; I am safe with thee.\nI laugh exulting. Make me something God;\nClear sunny veritable purity\nOf high existence in itself content\nAnd in the things that are besides itself\nAnd seeking for no measures. I have found\nThe good of earth if I have found this death.\nNow I am ready; take me when thou wilt.\"\n\nHe laid the letter in his desk with seal\nAnd superscription. When his sister came\nHe said \"You'll find a note there--afterwards--.\nTake it yourself to the town and let it go.\nBut do not see the name my sister true--\nI'll tell you all about it when you come.\"\n\nAnd as the eve through paler darker shades\nInsensibly declines and is no more\nThe lordly day once more a memory\nSo died he. In the hush of noon he died.\nThrough the low valley-fog he brake and climbed.\nThe sun shone on--why should he not shine on?\nThe summer noises rose o'er all the land.\nThe love of God lay warm on hill and plain.\n'Tis well to die in summer.\n\n                           When the breath\nAfter a long still pause returned no more\nThe old man sank upon his knees and said:\n\"Father I thank thee; it is over now;\nAnd thou hast helped him well through this sore time.\nSo one by one we all come back to thee\nAll sons and brothers thanking thee who didst\nPut of thy fatherhood in our poor hearts\nThat having children we might guess thy love.\nAnd at the last find all loves one in thee.\"\nAnd then he rose and comforted the maid\nWho in her brother lost the pride of life\nWeeping as all her heaven were full of rain.\n\nWhen that which was so like him--so unlike--\nLay in the churchyard and the green turf soon\nWould grow together healing up the wounds\nOf the old Earth who took her share again\nThe sister went to do his last request.\nThen found she with his other papers this--\nA farewell song in lowland Scottish tongue:--\n\n        Greetna father that I'm gaein'.\n          For fu' weel ye ken the gaet.\n        I' the winter corn ye're sawin'--\n          I' the hairst again ye hae't.\n\n        I'm gaein' hame to see my mither--\n          She'll be weel acquant or this\n        Sair we'll muse at ane anither\n          'Tween the auld word an' new kiss.\n\n        Love I'm doubtin' will be scanty\n          Roun' ye baith when I'm awa';\n        But the kirk has happin' plenty\n          Close aside me for you twa.\n\n        An' aboon there's room for mony--\n          'Twas na made for ane or twa;\n        But it grew for a' an' ony\n          Countin' love the best ava'.\n\n        Here aneath I ca' ye father:\n          Auld names we'll nor tyne nor spare;\n        A' my sonship I maun gather\n          For the Son is King up there.\n\n        Greetna father that I'm gaein';\n          For ye ken fu' weel the gaet:\n        Here in winter cast yer sawin'--\n          There in hairst again ye hae't.\n\nWhat of the lady? Little more I know.\nNot even if when she had read the lines\nShe rose in haste and to her chamber went\nAnd shut the door; nor if when she came forth\nA dawn of holier purpose shone across\nThe sadness of her brow; unto herself\nConvicted; though the great world knowing all\nMight call her pure as day--yea truth itself.\nOf these things I know nothing--only know\nThat on a warm autumnal afternoon\nWhen half-length shadows fell from mossy stones\nDarkening the green upon the grassy graves\nWhile the still church like a said prayer arose\nWhite in the sunshine silent as the graves\nEmpty of souls as is the tomb itself;\nA little boy who watched a cow near by\nGather her milk from alms of clover fields\nFlung over earthen dykes or straying out\nBeneath the gates upon the paths beheld\nAll suddenly--he knew not how she came--\nA lady closely veiled alone and still\nSeated upon a grave.

Three crosses stood\n  Amid the gloomy air.\nTwo bore two men--one was the Good;\n  The third rose waiting bare.\n\nA Roman soldier coming by\n  Mistook me for the third;\nI lifted up my asking eye\n  For Jesus' sign or word.\n\nI thought He signed that I should yield\n  And give the error way.\nI held my peace; no word revealed\n  No gesture uttered _nay._\n\nAgainst the cross a scaffold stood\n  Whence easy hands could nail\nThe doomed upon that altar-wood\n  Whose fire burns slow and pale.\n\nUpon this ledge he lifted me.\n  I stood all thoughtful there\nWaiting until the deadly tree\n  My form for fruit should bear.\n\nRose up the waves of fear and doubt\n  Rose up from heart to brain;\nThey shut the world of vision out\n  And thus they cried amain:\n\n\"Ah me! my hands--the hammer's knock--\n  The nails--the tearing strength!\"\nMy soul replied: \"'Tis but a shock\n  That grows to pain at length.\"\n\n\"Ah me! the awful fight with death;\n  The hours to hang and die;\nThe thirsting gasp for common breath\n  That passes heedless by!\"\n\nMy soul replied: \"A faintness soon\n  Will shroud thee in its fold;\nThe hours will go--the fearful noon\n  Rise pass--and thou art cold.\n\n\"And for thy suffering what to thee\n  Is that? or care of thine?\nThou living branch upon the tree\n  Whose root is the Divine!\n\n\"'Tis His to care that thou endure;\n  That pain shall grow or fade;\nWith bleeding hands hang on thy cure\n  He knows what He hath made.\"\n\nAnd still for all the inward wail\n  My foot was firmly pressed;\nFor still the fear lest I should fail\n  Was stronger than the rest.\n\nAnd thus I stood until the strife\n  The bonds of slumber brake;\nI felt as I had ruined life\n  Had fled and come awake.\n\nYet I was glad my heart confessed\n  The trial went not on;\nGlad likewise I had stood the test\n  As far as it had gone.\n\nAnd yet I fear some recreant thought\n  Which now I all forget\nThat painful feeling in me wrought\n  Of failure lingering yet.\n\nAnd if the dream had had its scope\n  I might have fled the field;\nBut yet I thank Thee for the hope\n  And think I dared not yield.\n\n\nVI\n\nMethinks I hear as I lie slowly dying\n  Indulgent friends say weeping \"_He was good._\"\nI fail to speak a faint denial trying--\n  They answer \"_His humility withstood._\"\n\nI knowing better part with love unspoken;\n  And find the unknown world not all unknown.\nThe bonds that held me from my centre broken\n  I seek my home the Saviour's homely throne.\n\nHow He will greet me I walk on and wonder;\n  And think I know what I will say to Him.\nI fear no sapphire floor of cloudy thunder\n  I fear no passing vision great and dim.\n\nBut He knows all my unknown weary story:\n  How will He judge me pure and good and fair?\nI come to Him in all His conquered glory\n  Won from such life as I went dreaming there!\n\nI come; I fall before Him faintly saying:\n  \"Ah Lord shall I thy loving favour win?\nEarth's beauties tempted me; my walk was straying--\n  I have no honour--but may I come in?\"\n\n\"I know thee well. Strong prayer did keep me stable;\n  To me the earth is very lovely too.\nThou shouldst have come to me to make thee able\n  To love it greatly--but thou hast got through.\"\n\n\n\nVII\n\n_Lord of the world's undying youth\n  What joys are in thy might!\nWhat beauties of the inner truth\n  And of the outer sight!\nAnd when the heart is dim and sad\n  Too weak for wisdom's beam\nThou sometimes makest it right glad\n  With but a childish dream_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLo! I will dream this windy day;\n  No sunny spot is bare;\nDull vapours in uncomely play\n  Are weltering through the air.\nIf I throw wide my windowed breast\n  To all the blasts that blow\nMy soul will rival in unrest\n  Those tree-tops--how they go!\n\nBut I will dream like any child;\n  For lo! a mighty swan\nWith radiant plumage undented\n  And folded airy van\nWith serpent neck all proudly bent\n  And stroke of swarthy oar\nDreams on to me by sea-maids sent\n  Over the billows hoar.\n\nFor in a wave-worn rock I lie;\n  Outside the waters foam;\nAnd echoes of old storms go by\n  Within my sea-built dome.\nThe waters half the gloomy way\n  Beneath its arches come;\nThrobbing to unseen billows' play\n  The green gulfs waver dumb.\n\nA dawning twilight through the cave\n  In moony gleams doth go\nHalf from the swan above the wave\n  Half from the swan below.\nClose to my feet she gently drifts\n  Among the glistening things;\nShe stoops her crowny head and lifts\n  White shoulders of her wings.\n\nOh! earth is rich with many a nest\n  Deep soft and ever new\nPure delicate and full of rest;\n  But dearest there are two.\nI would not tell them but to minds\n  That are as white as they;\nIf others hear of other kinds\n  I wish them far away.\n\nUpon the neck between the wings\n  Of a white sailing swan\nA flaky bed of shelterings--\n  There you will find the one.\nThe other--well it will not out\n  Nor need I tell it you;\nI've told you one and need you doubt\n  When there are only two?\n\nFulfil old dreams O splendid bird\n  Me o'er the waters bear;\nSure never ocean's face was stirred\n  By any ship so fair!\nSure never whiteness found a dress\n  Upon the earth to go\nSo true profound and rich unless\n  It was the falling snow.\n\nWith quick short flutter of each wing\n  Half-spread and stooping crown\nShe calls me; and with one glad spring\n  I nestle in the down.\nPlunges the bark then bounds aloft\n  With lessening dip and rise.\nRound curves her neck with motion soft--\n  Sure those are woman's eyes.\n\nOne stroke unseen with oary feet\n  One stroke--away she sweeps;\nOver the waters pale we fleet\n  Suspended in the deeps.\nAnd round the sheltering rock and lo!\n  The tumbling weltering sea!\nOn to the west away we go\n Over the waters free!\n\nHer motions moulded to the wave\n  Her billowy neck thrown back\nWith slow strong pulse stately and grave\n  She cleaves a rippling track.\nAnd up the mounting wave we glide\n  With climbing sweeping blow;\nAnd down the steep far-sloping side\n  To flowing vales below.\n\nI hear the murmur of the deep\n  In countless ripples pass\nLike talking children in their sleep\n  Like winds in reedy grass.\nAnd through some ruffled feathers I\n  The glassy rolling mark\nWith which the waves eternally\n  Roll on from dawn to dark.\n\nThe night is blue the stars aglow;\n  In solemn peace o'erhead\nThe archless depth of heaven; below\n  The murmuring heaving bed.\nA thickened night it heaveth on\n  A fallen earthly sky;\nThe shadows of its stars alone\n  Are left to know it by.\n\nWhat faints across the lifted loop\n Of cloud-veil upward cast?\nWith sea-veiled limbs a sleeping group\n  Of Nereids dreaming past.\nSwim on my boat; who knows but I\n  Ere night sinks to her grave\nMay see in splendour pale float by\n  The Venus of the wave?\n\n\nVIII\n\nIn the night round a lady dreaming--\n  A queen among the dreams--\nCame the silent sunset streaming\n  Mixed with the voice of streams.\nA silver fountain springing\n  Blossoms in molten gold;\nAnd the airs of the birds float ringing\n  Through harmonies manifold.\n\nShe lies in a watered valley;\n  Her garden melts away\nThrough foot-path and curving alley\n  Into the wild wood grey.\nAnd the green of the vale goes creeping\n  To the feet of the rugged hills\nWhere the moveless rocks are keeping\n  The homes of the wandering rills.\n\nAnd the hues of the flowers grow deeper\n  Till they dye her very brain;\nAnd their scents like the soul of a sleeper\n  Wander and waver and rain.\nFor dreams have a wealth of glory\n  That daylight cannot give:\nAh God! make the hope a story--\n  Bid the dreams arise and live.\n\nShe lay and gazed at the flowers\n  Till her soul's own garden smiled\nWith blossom-o'ershaded bowers\n  Great colours and splendours wild.\nAnd her heart filled up with gladness\n  Till it could only ache;\nAnd it turned aside to sadness\n  As if for pity's sake.\n\nAnd a fog came o'er the meadows\n  And the rich hues fainting lay;\nCame from the woods the shadows\n  Came from the rocks the grey.\nAnd the sunset thither had vanished\n  Where the sunsets always go;\nAnd the sounds of the stream were banished\n  As if slain by frost and snow.\n\nAnd the flowers paled fast and faster\n  And they crumbled fold on fold\nTill they looked like the stained plaster\n  Of a cornice in ruin old.\nAnd they blackened and shrunk together\n  As if scorched by the breath of flame\nWith a sad perplexity whether\n  They were or were not the same.\n\nAnd she saw herself still lying\n  And smiling on the while;\nAnd the smile instead of dying\n  Was fixed in an idiot smile.\nAnd the lady arose in sorrow\n  Out of her sleep's dark stream;\nBut her dream made dark the morrow\n  And she told me the haunting dream.\n\nAlas! dear lady I know it\n  The dream that all is a dream;\nThe joy with the doubt below it\n  That the bright things only seem.\nOne moment of sad commotion\n  And one of doubt's withering rule--\nAnd the great wave-pulsing ocean\n  Is only a gathered pool.\n\nAnd the flowers are spots of painting\n  Of lifeless staring hue;\nThough your heart is sick to fainting\n  They say not a word to you.\nAnd the birds know nought of gladness\n  They are only song-machines;\nAnd a man is a skilful madness\n  And the women pictured queens.\n\nAnd fiercely we dig the fountain\n  To know the water true;\nAnd we climb the crest of the mountain\n  To part it from the blue.\nBut we look too far before us\n  For that which is more than nigh;\nThough the sky is lofty o'er us\n  We are always in the sky.\n\nAnd the fog o'er the roses that creepeth\n  Steams from the unknown sea\nIn the dark of the soul that sleepeth\n  And sigheth constantly\nBecause o'er the face of its waters\n  The breathing hath not gone;\nAnd instead of glad sons and daughters\n  Wild things are moaning on.\n\nWhen the heart knows well the Father\n  The eyes will be always day;\nBut now they grow dim the rather\n  That the light is more than they.\nBelieve amidst thy sorrows\n  That the blight that swathes the earth\nIs only a shade that borrows\n  Life from thy spirit's dearth.\n\nGod's heart is the fount of beauty;\n  Thy heart is its visible well;\nIf it vanish do thou thy duty\n  That necromantic spell;\nAnd thy heart to the Father crying\n  Will fill with waters deep;\nThine eyes may say _Beauty is dying;_\n  But thy spirit _She goes to sleep._\n\nAnd I fear not thy fair soul ever\n  Will smile as thy image smiled;\nIt had fled with a sudden shiver\n  And thy body lay beguiled.\nLet the flowers and thy beauty perish;\n  Let them go to the ancient dust.\nBut the hopes that the children cherish\n  They are the Father's trust.\n\n\nIX\n\nA great church in an empty square\n  A place of echoing tones;\nFeet pass not oft enough to wear\n  The grass between the stones.\n\nThe jarring sounds that haunt its gates\n  Like distant thunders boom;\nThe boding heart half-listening waits\n  As for a coming doom.\n\nThe door stands wide the church is bare\n  Oh horror ghastly sore!\nA gulf of death with hideous stare\n  Yawns in the earthen floor;\n\nAs if the ground had sunk away\n  Into a void below:\nIts shapeless sides of dark-hued clay\n  Hang ready aye to go.\n\nI am myself a horrid grave\n  My very heart turns grey;\nThis charnel-hole--will no one save\n  And force my feet away?\n\nThe changing dead are there I know\n  In terror ever new;\nYet down the frightful slope I go\n  That downward goeth too.\n\nBeneath the caverned floor I hie\n  And seem with anguish dull\nTo enter by the empty eye\n  Into a monstrous skull.\n\nStumbling on what I dare not guess\n  And wading through the gloom\nLess deep the shades my eyes oppress\n  I see the awful tomb.\n\nMy steps have led me to a door\n  With iron clenched and barred;\nGrim Death hides there a ghastlier store\n  Great spider in his ward.\n\nThe portals shake the bars are bowed\n  As if an earthy wind\nThat never bore a leaf or cloud\n  Were pressing hard behind.\n\nThey shake they groan they outward strain.\n  What sight of dire dismay\nWill freeze its form upon my brain\n  And turn it into clay?\n\nThey shake they groan they bend they crack;\n  The bars the doors divide:\nA flood of glory at their back\n  Hath burst the portals wide.\n\nFlows in the light of vanished days\n  The joy of long-set moons;\nThe flood of radiance billowy plays\n  In sweet-conflicting tunes.\n\nThe gulf is filled with flashing tides\n  An awful gulf no more;\nA maze of ferns clothes all its sides\n  Of mosses all its floor.\n\nAnd floating through the streams appear\n  Such forms of beauty rare\nAs every aim at beauty here\n  Had found its _would be_ there.\n\nI said: 'Tis well no hand came nigh\n  To turn my steps astray;\n'Tis good we cannot choose but die\n  That life may have its way.\n\n\nX\n\nBefore I sleep some dreams draw nigh\n  Which are not fancy mere;\nFor sudden lights an inward eye\n  And wondrous things appear.\n\nThus unawares with vision wide\n  A steep hill once I saw\nIn faint dream lights which ever hide\n  Their fountain and their law.\n\nAnd up and down the hill reclined\n  A host of statues old;\nSuch wondrous forms as you might find\n  Deep under ancient mould.\n\nThey lay wild scattered all along\n  And maimed as if in fight;\nBut every one of all the throng\n  Was precious to the sight.\n\nBetwixt the night and hill they ranged\n  In dead composure cast.\nAs suddenly the dream was changed\n  And all the wonder past.\n\nThe hill remained; but what it bore\n  Was broken reedy stalks\nBent hither thither drooping o'er\n  Like flowers o'er weedy walks.\n\nFor each dim form of marble rare\n  Bent a wind-broken reed;\nSo hangs on autumn-field long-bare\n Some tall and straggling weed.\n\nThe autumn night hung like a pall\n  Hung mournfully and dead;\nAnd if a wind had waked at all\n  It had but moaned and fled.\n\n\nXI\n\nI lay and dreamed. Of thought and sleep\n  Was born a heavenly joy:\nI dreamed of two who always keep\n  Me happy as a boy.\n\nI was with them. My heart-bells rung\n  With joy my heart above;\nTheir present heaven my earth o'erhung\n  And earth was glad with love.\n\nThe dream grew troubled. Crowds went on\n  And sought their varied ends;\nTill stream on stream the crowds had gone\n  And swept away my friends.\n\nI was alone. A miry road\n  I followed all in vain;\nNo well-known hill the landscape showed\n  It was a wretched plain;\n\nWhere mounds of rubbish ugly pits\n  And brick-fields scarred the globe;\nThose wastes where desolation sits\n  Without her ancient robe.\n\nA drizzling rain proclaimed the skies\n  As wretched as the earth;\nI wandered on and weary sighs\n  Were all my lot was worth.\n\nWhen sudden as I turned my way\n  Burst in the ocean-waves:\nAnd lo! a blue wild-dancing bay\n  Fantastic rocks and caves!\n\nI wept with joy. Ah! sometimes so\n  In common daylight grief\nA beauty to the heart will go\n  And bring the heart relief.\n\nAnd wandering reft of hope or friend\n  If such a thing should be\nOne day we take the downward bend\n  And lo Eternity!\n\nI wept with joy delicious tears\n  Which dreams alone bestow;\nUntil mayhap from out the years\n  We sleep and further go.\n\n\nXII\n\nNow I will mould a dream awake\n  Which I asleep would dream;\nFrom all the forms of fancy take\n  One that shall also seem;\nSeem in my verse (if not my brain)\n  Which sometimes may rejoice\nIn airy forms of Fancy's train\n  Though nobler are my choice.\n\nSome truth o'er all the land may lie\n  In children's dreams at night;\n_They_ do not build the charmed sky\n  That domes them with delight.\nAnd o'er the years that follow soon\n  So all unlike the dreams\nWander their odours gleams their moon\n  And flow their winds and streams.\n\nNow I would dream that I awake\n  In scent of cool night air\nAbove me star-clouds close and break;\n  Beneath--where am I where?\nA strange delight pervades my breast\n  Of ancient pictures dim\nWhere fair forms on the waters rest\n  Or in the breezes swim.\n\nI rest on arms as soft as strong\n  Great arms of woman-mould;\nMy head is pillowed whence a song\n  In many a rippling fold\nO'erfloods me from its bubbling spring:\n  A Titan goddess bears\nMe floating on her unseen wing\n  Through gracious midnight airs.\n\nAnd I am borne o'er sleeping seas\n  O'er murmuring ears of corn\nOver the billowy tops of trees\n  O'er roses pale till morn.\nOver the lake--ah! nearer float\n  Down on the water's breast;\nLet me look deep and gazing doat\n  On that white lily's nest.\n\nThe harebell's bed as o'er we pass\n  Swings all its bells about;\nFrom waving blades of polished grass\n  Flash moony splendours out.\nOld homes we brush in wooded glades;\n  No eyes at windows shine;\nFor all true men and noble maids\n  Are out in dreams like mine.\n\nAnd foam-bell-kisses drift and break\n  From wind-waves of the South\nAgainst my brow and eyes awake\n  And yet I see no mouth.\nLight laughter ripples down the air\n  Light sighs float up below;\nAnd o'er me ever radiant pair\n  The Queen's great star-eyes go.\n\nAnd motion like a dreaming wave\n  Wafts me in gladness dim\nThrough air just cool enough to lave\n  With sense each conscious limb.\nBut ah! the dream eludes the rhyme\n  As dreams break free from sleep;\nThe dream will keep its own free time\n  In mazy float or sweep.\n\nAnd thought too keen for joy awakes\n  As on the horizon far\nA dead pale light the circle breaks\n  But not a dawning star.\nNo there I cannot dare not go;\n  Pale women wander there;\nWith cold fire murderous eyeballs glow;\n  And children see despair.\n\nThe joy has lost its dreamy zest;\n  I feel a pang of loss;\nMy wandering hand o'er mounds of rest\n  Finds only mounds of moss.\nBeneath the bare night-stars I lie;\n  Cold winds are moaning past:\nAlas! the earth with grief will die\n  The great earth is aghast.\n\nI look above--there dawns no face;\n  Around--no footsteps come;\nNo voice inhabits this great space;\n  God knows but keepeth dumb.\nI wake and know that God is by\n  And more than dreams will give;\nAnd that the hearts that moan and die\n  Shall yet awake and live.", "TO AURELIO SAFFI": "_To God and man be simply true:\nDo as thou hast been wont to do:_\nOr _Of the old more in the new:_\nMean all the same when said to you.\n\nI love thee.

Oh! still\nAnd cold and hard to look upon like men\nWho do stern deeds in times of turbulence\nQuell the hail-rattle with their granite brows\nAnd let the thunder burst and pass away--\nThey too did gather round sky-dwelling peaks\nThe trailing garments of the travelling sun\nWhich he had lifted from his ocean-bed\nAnd swept along his road. They rent them down\nIn scattering showers upon the trees and grass\nIn noontide rains with heavy ringing drops\nOr in still twilight moisture tenderly.\nAnd from their sides were born the gladsome streams;\nSome creeping gently out in tiny springs\nAs they were just created scarce a foot\nFrom the hill's surface in the matted roots\nOf plants whose green betrays the secret birth;\nSome hurrying forth from caverns deep and dark\nUpfilling to the brim a basin huge\nThick covered with soft moss greening the wave\nAs evermore it welled over the edge\nUpon the rocks below in boiling heaps;\nFit basin for a demi-god at morn\nWaking amid the crags to lave his limbs\nThen stride Hyperion o'er sun-paven peaks.\nAnd down the hill-side sped the fresh-born wave\nNow hid from sight in arched caverns cold\nNow arrowing slantwise down the terraced steep\nNow springing like a child from step to step\nOf the rough water-stair; until it found\nA deep-hewn passage for its slower course\nGuiding it down to lowliness and rest\nBetwixt wet walls of darkness darker yet\nWith pine trees lining all their sides like hair\nOr as their own straight needles clothe their boughs;\nUntil at length in broader light it ran\nWith more articulate sounds amid the stones\nIn the slight shadow of the maiden birch\nAnd the stream-loving willow; and ere long\nGreat blossoming trees dropt flowers upon its breast;\nChiefly the crimson-spotted cream-white flowers\nHeaped up in cones amid cone-drooping leaves;\nGreen hanging leaf-cones towering white flower-cones\nUpon the great cone-fashioned chestnut tree.\nEach made a tiny ripple where it fell\nThe trembling pleasure of the smiling wave\nWhich bore it then in slow funereal course\nDown to the outspread sunny sheen where lies\nThe lake uplooking to the far-off snow\nIts mother still though now so far away;\nFeeding it still with long descending lines\nOf shining speeding streams that gather peace\nIn journeying to the rest of that still lake\nNow lying sleepy in the warm red sun\nWhich says its dear goodnight and goeth down.\n\nAll pale and withered and disconsolate\nThe moon is looking on impatiently;\nFor 'twixt the shining tent-roof of the day\nAnd the sun-deluged lake for mirror-floor\nHer thin pale lamping is too sadly grey\nTo shoot in silver-barbed white-plumed arrows\nCold maiden splendours on the flashing fish:\nWait for thy empire Night day-weary moon!\nAnd thou shalt lord it in one realm at least\nWhere two souls walk a single Paradise.\nTake to thee courage for the sun is gone;\nHis praisers the glad birds have hid their heads;\nLong ghost-like forms of trees lie on the grass;\nAll things are clothed in an obscuring light\nFusing their outline in a dreamy mass;\nSome faint dim shadows from thy beauty fall\nOn the clear lake which melts them half away--\nShine faster stronger O reviving moon!\nBurn up O lamp of Earth hung high in Heaven!\n\nAnd through a warm thin summer mist she shines\nA silver setting to the diamond stars;\nAnd the dark boat cleaveth a glittering way\nWhere the one steady beauty of the moon\nMakes many changing beauties on the wave\nBroken by jewel-dropping oars which drive\nThe boat as human impulses the soul;\nWhile like the sovereign will the helm's firm law\nDirects the whither of the onward force.\nAt length midway he leaves the swaying oars\nHalf floating in the blue gulf underneath\nAnd on a load of gathered flowers reclines\nLeaving the boat to any air that blows\nHis soul to any pulse from the unseen heart.\nStraight from the helm a white hand gleaming flits\nAnd settles on his face and nestles there\nPale night-belated butterfly to sleep.\nFor on her knees his head lies satisfied;\nAnd upward downward dark eyes look and rest\nFinding their home in likeness.

Iron bands and huge stone blocks\nThat held them to their task strained shook until\nThe city trembled. Those pale-visaged forms\nWere hastening on to feed their groaning strength\nWith labour to the full.\n\n                        Look! there they come\nPoor amid poverty; she with her gown\nDrawn over her meek head; he trying much\nBut fruitless half to shield her from the rain.\nThey enter the wide gates amid the jar\nAnd clash and shudder of the awful force\nThat conquering force still vibrates on as if\nWith an excess of power hungry for work.\nWith differing strength to different tasks they part\nTo be the soul of knowledge unto strength;\nFor man has eked his body out with wheels\nAnd cranks and belts and levers pinions screws--\nOne body all pervaded still with life\nFrom man the maker's will. 'Mid keen-eyed men\nThin featured and exact his part is found;\nHers where the dusk air shines with lustrous eyes.\n\nAnd there they laboured through the murky day\nWhose air was livid mist their only breath;\nFoul floating dust of swift revolving wheels\nAnd feathery spoil of fast contorted threads\nMaking a sultry chaos in the sun.\nUntil at length slow swelled the welcome dark\nA dull Lethean heaving tide of death\nUp from the caves of Night to make an end;\nAnd filling every corner of the place\nChoked in its waves the clanking of the looms.\nAnd Earth put on her sleeping dress and took\nHer children home into its bosom-folds\nAnd nursed them as a mother-ghost might sit\nWith her neglected darlings in the dark.\nSo with dim satisfaction in their hearts\nThough with tired feet and aching head they went\nParting the clinging fog to find their home.\nIt was a dreary place. Unfinished walls\nFar drearier than ruins overspread\nWith long-worn sweet forgetfulness amidst\nEarth-heaps and bricks rain-pools and ugliness\nRose up around banishing further yet\nThe Earth with its spring-time young-mother smile\nFrom children's eyes that had forgot to play.\nBut though the house was dull and wrapt in fog\nIt yet awoke to life yea cheerfulness\nWhen darkness oped a fire-eye in the grate\nAnd the dim candle's smoky flame revealed\nA room which could not be all desolate\nBeing a temple proven by the signs\nSeen in the ancient place. For here was light;\nAnd blazing fire with darkness on its skirts;\nBread; and pure water ready to make clean\nBeside a chest of holiday attire;\nAnd in the twilight edges of the light\nA book scarce seen; and for the wondrous veil\nThose human forms behind which lay concealed\nThe Holy of Holies God's own secret place\nThe lowly human heart wherein He dwells.\nAnd by the table-altar they sat down\nTo eat their Eucharist God feeding them:\nTheir food was Love made visible in Form--\nIncarnate Love in food. For he to whom\nA common meal can be no Eucharist\nWho thanks for food and strength not for the love\nThat made cold water for its blessedness\nAnd wine for gladness' sake has yet to learn\nThe heart-delight of inmost thankfulness\nFor innermost reception.\n\n                        Then they sat\nResting with silence the soul's inward sleep\nWhich feedeth it with strength; till gradually\nThey grew aware of light that overcame\nThe light within and through the dingy blind\nCast from the window-frame two shadow-glooms\nThat made a cross of darkness on the white\nDark messenger of light itself unseen.\nThe woman rose and half she put aside\nThe veil that hid the whole of glorious night;\nAnd lo! a wind had mowed the earth-sprung fog;\nAnd lo! on high the white exultant moon\nFrom clear blue window curtained all with white\nGreeted them at their shadowy window low\nWith quiet smile; for two things made her glad:\nOne that she saw the glory of the sun;\nFor while the earth lay all athirst for light\nShe drank the fountain-waves. The other joy;\nSprung from herself: she fought the darkness well\nThinning the great cone-shadow of the earth\nPaling its ebon hue with radiant showers\nUpon its sloping side. The woman said\nWith hopeful look: \"To-morrow will be bright\nWith sunshine for our holiday--to-morrow--\nThink! we shall see the green fields in the sun.\"\nSo with hearts hoping for a simple joy\nYet high withal being no less than the sun\nThey laid them down in nightly death that waits\nPatiently for the day.\n\n                      That sun was high\nWhen they awoke at length. The moon low down\nHad almost vanished clothed upon with light;\nAnd night was swallowed up of day. In haste\nChiding their weariness that leagued with sleep\nThey having clothed themselves in clean attire\nBy the low door stooping with priestly hearts\nEntered God's vision-room his wonder-world.\n\nOne side the street the windows all were moons\nTo light the other that in shadow lay.\nThe path was almost dry; the wind asleep.\nAnd down the sunny side a woman came\nIn a red cloak that made the whole street glad--\nFit clothing though she was so feeble and old;\nFor when they stopped and asked her how she fared\nShe said with cheerful words and smile that owed\nNone of its sweetness to an ivory lining:\n\"I'm always better in the open air.\"\n\"Dear heart!\" said they \"how freely she will breathe\nIn the open air of heaven!\" She stood in the morn\nLike a belated autumn-flower in spring\nDazed by the rushing of the new-born life\nUp the earth's winding cavern-stairs to see\nThrough window-buds the calling waking sun.\nOr as in dreams we meet the ghost of one\nBeloved in youth who walketh with few words\nAnd they are of the past. Yet joy to her!\nShe too from earthy grave was climbing up\nUnto the spirit-windows high and far\nShe the new life for a celestial spring\nAnswering the light that shineth evermore.\n\nWith hopeful sadness thus they passed along\nDissolving streets towards the smiles of spring\nOf which green visions gleamed and glided by\nAcross far-narrowing avenues of brick:\nThe ripples only of her laughter float\nThrough the low winding caverns of the town;\nYet not a stone upon the paven street\nBut shareth in the impulse of her joy\nHeaven's life that thrills anew through the outworn earth;\nDescending like the angel that did stir\nBethesda's pool and made the sleepy wave\nPulse with quick healing through the withered limb\nIn joyous pangs. By an unfinished street\nForth came they on a wide and level space;\nGreen fields lay side by side and hedgerow trees\nStood here and there as waiting for some good.\nBut no calm river meditated through\nThe weary flat to the less level sea;\nNo forest trees on pillared stems and boughs\nBent in great Gothic arches bore aloft\nA cloudy temple-roof of tremulous leaves;\nNo clear line where the kissing lips of sky\nAnd earth meet undulating but a haze\nThat hides--oh if it hid wild waves! alas!\nIt hides but fields it hides but fields and trees!\nSave eastward where a few hills far away\nCame forth in the sun or drew back when the clouds\nWent over them dissolving them in shade.\nBut the life-robe of earth was beautiful\nAs all most common things are loveliest;\nA forest of green waving fairy trees\nThat carpeted the earth for lowly feet\nBending unto their tread lowliest of all\nEarth's lowly children born for ministering\nUnto the heavenly stranger stately man;\nThat he by subtle service from all kinds\nFrom every breeze and every bounding wave\nFrom night-sky cavernous with heaps of storm\nAnd from the hill rejoicing in the sun\nMight grow a humble lowly child of God;\nLowly as knowing his high parentage;\nHumble because all beauties wait on him\nLike lady-servants ministering for love.\nAnd he that hath not rock and hill and stream\nMust learn to look for other beauty near;\nTo know the face of ocean solitudes\nThe darkness dashed with glory and the shades\nWind-fretted and the mingled tints upthrown\nFrom shallow bed or raining from the sky.\nAnd he that hath not ocean and dwells low\nNot hill-befriended if his eyes have ceased\nTo drink enjoyment from the billowy grass\nAnd from the road-side flower (like one who dwells\nWith homely features round him every day\nAnd so takes refuge in the loving eyes\nWhich are their heaven the dwelling-place of light)\nMust straightway lift his eyes unto the heavens\nLike God's great palette where His artist hand\nNever can strike the brush but beauty wakes;\nVast sweepy comet-curves that net the soul\nIn pleasure; endless sky-stairs; patient clouds\nWhite till they blush at the sun's goodnight kiss;\nAnd filmy pallours and great mountain crags.\nBut beyond all absorbing all the rest\nLies the great heaven the expression of deep space\nForeshortened to a vaulted dome of blue;\nThe Infinite crowded in a single glance\nWhere yet the eye descends depth within depth;\nLike mystery of Truth clothed in high form\nEvasive spiritual no limiting\nBut something that denies an end and yet\nCan be beheld by wondering human eyes.\nThere looking up one well may feel how vain\nTo search for God in this vast wilderness!\nFor over him would arch void depth for ever;\nNor ever would he find a God or Heaven\nThough lifting wings were his to soar abroad\nThrough boundless heights of space; or eyes to dive\nTo microscopic depths: he would come back\nAnd say _There is no God;_ and sit and weep;\nTill in his heart a child's voice woke and cried\n_Father! my Father!_ Then the face of God\nBreaks forth with eyes everywhere suddenly\nAnd not a space of blue nor floating cloud\nNor grassy vale nor distant purple height\nBut trembling with a presence all divine\nSays _Here I am my child._\n\n                            Gazing awhile\nThey let the lesson of the sky sink deep\nInto their hearts; withdrawing then their eyes\nThey knew the Earth again. And as they went\nOft in the changing heavens those distant hills\nShone clear upon the horizon. Then awoke\nA strange and unknown longing in their souls\nAs if for something loved in years gone by\nAnd vanished in its beauty and its love\nSo long that it retained no name or form\nAnd lay on childhood's verge all but forgot\nWrapt in the enchanted rose-mists of that land:\nAs if amidst those hills were wooded dells\nSummer and gentle winds and odours free\nDeep sleeping waters gorgeous flowers and birds\nPure winged throats. But here all things around\nWere in their spring. The very light that lay\nUpon the grass seemed new-born like the grass\nSprung with it from the earth. The very stones\nLooked warm. The brown ploughed earth seemed swelling up\nFilled like a sponge with sunbeams which lay still\nNestling unseen and broodingly and warm\nIn every little nest corner or crack\nWherein might hide a blind and sleepy seed\nWaiting the touch of penetrative life\nTo wake and grow and beautify the earth.\nThe mossy stems and boughs where yet no life\nExuberant overflowed in buds and leaves\nWere clothed in golden splendours interwoven\nWith many shadows from the branches bare.\nAnd through their tops the west wind rushing went\nCalling aloud the sleeping sap within:\nThe thrill passed downwards from the roots in air\nTo the roots tremulous in the embracing ground.\nAnd though no buds with little dots of light\nSparkled the darkness of the hedgerow twigs;\nSoftening expanding in the warm light-bath\nSeemed the dry smoky bark.\n\n                          Thus in the fields\nThey spent their holiday. And when the sun\nWas near the going down they turned them home\nWith strengthened hearts. For they were filled with light\nAnd with the spring; and like the bees went back\nTo their dark house laden with blessed sights\nWith gladsome sounds home to their treasure-cave;\nWhere henceforth sudden gleams of spring would pass\nThorough the four-walled darkness of the room;\nAnd sounds of spring-time whisper trembling by\nThough stony streets with iron echoed round.\nAnd as they crossed a field they came by chance\nUpon a place where once a home had been;\nFragments of ruined walls half-overgrown\nWith moss for even stones had their green robe.\nIt had been a small cottage with a plot\nOf garden-ground in front mapped out with walks\nNow scarce discernible but that the grass\nWas thinner the ground harder to the foot:\nThe place was simply shadowed with an old\nAlmost erased human carefulness.\nClose by the ruined wall where once had been\nThe door dividing it from the great world\nMaking it _home_ a single snowdrop grew.\n'Twas the sole remnant of a family\nOf flowers that in this garden once had dwelt\nVanished with all their hues of glowing life\nSave one too white for death.\n\n                             And as its form\nArose within the brain a feeling sprung\nUp in their souls new white and delicate;\nA waiting longing patient hopefulness\nThe snowdrop of the heart. The heavenly child\nPale with the earthly cold hung its meek head\nEnduring all and so victorious;\nThe Summer's earnest in the waking Earth\nThe spirit's in the heart.\n\n                          I love thee flower\nWith a love almost human tenderly;\nThe Spring's first child yea thine my hoping heart!\nUpon thy inner leaves and in thy heart\nEnough of green to tell thou know'st the grass;\nIn thy white mind remembering lowly friends;\nBut most I love thee for that little stain\nOf earth on thy transfigured radiancy\nWhich thou hast lifted with thee from thy grave\nThe soiling of thy garments on thy road\nTravelling forth into the light and air\nThe heaven of thy pure rest. Some gentle rain\nWill surely wash thee white and send the earth\nBack to the place of earth; but now it signs\nThee child of earth of human birth as we.\n\nWith careful hands uprooting it they bore\nThe little plant a willing captive home;\nWilling to enter dark abodes secure\nIn its own tale of light. As once of old\nBearing all heaven in words of promising\nThe Angel of the Annunciation came\nIt carried all the spring into that house;\nA pot of mould its only tie to Earth\nIts heaven an ell of blue 'twixt chimney-tops\nIts world henceforth that little low-ceiled room\nSymbol and child of spring it took its place\n'Midst all those types to be a type with them\nOf what so many feel not knowing it;\nThe hidden springtime that is drawing nigh.\nAnd henceforth when the shadow of the cross\nWill enter clothed in moonlight still and dark\nThe flower will nestle at its foot till day\nPale drooping heart-content.\n\n                              To rest they went.\nAnd all night long the snowdrop glimmered white\nAmid the dark unconscious and unseen.\n\nBefore the sun had crowned his eastern hill\nWith its world-diadem they woke.\n\n                                 I looked\nOut of the windows of the inner dream\nAnd saw the edge of the sun's glory rise\nEastward behind the hills the lake-cup's rim.\nAnd as it came it sucked up in itself\nAs deeds drink words or daylight candle-flame\nThat other sun rising to light the dream.\nThey lay awake and thoughtful comforted\nWith yesterday which nested in their hearts\nYet haunted with the sound of grinding wheels.", "THE OUTER DREAM": "And as they lay and looked into the room\nIt wavered changed dissolved beneath the sun\nWhich mingled both the mornings in their eyes\nTill the true conquered and the unreal passed.\nNo walls but woods bathed in a level sun;\nNo ceiling but the vestal sky of morn;\nNo bed but flowers floating 'mid floating leaves\nOn water which grew audible as they stirred\nAnd lifted up their heads.

and then he said\nMonotonous like solemn-read command:\n\"For love is of the earth earthy and laid\nDown lifeless in its mother's womb at last.\"\nThe strange sound through the great pine-branches passed.\n\nAgain a shadow as it were of glass\nOver the moonbeams on the cottage floor\nShapeless and dim almost unseen doth pass;\nA mingled sound of rain-drops at the door\nBut not a sound upon the window was.\nA look of sorrowing doubt the youth's face wore;\nAnd the two hounds half-rose and gazed at him\nEyeing his countenance by the taper dim.\n\nNow nothing of these things the maiden noted\nBut turned her face with half-reproachful look\nAs doubting whether he the words had quoted\nOut of some evil earth-begotten book;\nOr upward from his spirit's depths had floated\nThose words like bubbles in a low dead brook;\nBut his eyes seemed to question--Yea or No;\nAnd so the maiden answered: \"'Tis not so;\n\n\"Love is of heaven and heavenly.\" A faint smile\nParted his lips as a thought unexpressed\nWere speaking in his heart; and for a while\nHe gently laid his head upon her breast;\nHis thought a bark that by a sunny isle\nAt length hath found the haven of its rest\nYet must not long remain but forward go:\nHe lifted up his head and answered: \"No--\n\n\"Maiden I have loved other maidens.\" Pale\nHer red lips grew. \"I loved them; yes but they\nOne after one in trial's hour did fail;\nFor after sunset clouds again are grey.\"\nA sudden light flashed through the silken veil\nThat drooping hid her eyes; and then there lay\nA stillness on her face waiting; and then\nThe little clock rung out the hour of ten.\n\nMoaning again the great pine-branches bow\nAs if they tried in vain the wind to stem.\nStill looking in her eyes the youth said--\"Thou\nArt not more beautiful than some of them;\nBut more of earnestness is on thy brow;\nThine eyes are beaming like some dark-bright gem\nThat pours from hidden heart upon the night\nThe rays it gathered from the noon-day light.\n\n\"Look on this hand beloved; thou didst see\nThe horse that broke from many it did hold:\nTwo hours shall pass away and it will be\nAll withered up and dry wrinkled and old\nBig-veined and skinny to extremity.\"\nCalmly upon him looked the maiden bold;\nThe stag-hounds rose and gazed on him and then\nWith a low whine laid themselves down again.\n\nA minute's silence and the youth spake on:\n\"Dearest I have a fearful thing to bear\"\n(A pain-cloud crossed his face and then was gone)\n\"At midnight when the moon sets; wilt thou dare\nTo go with me or must I go alone\nTo meet an agony that will not spare?\"\nShe spoke not rose and towards her mantle went;\nHis eyes did thank her--she was well content.\n\n\"Not yet not yet; it is not time; for see\nThe hands have far to travel to the hour;\nYet time is scarcely left for telling thee\nThe past and present and the coming power\nOf the great darkness that will fall on me:\nRoses and jasmine twine the bridal bower--\nIf ever bower and bridal joy be mine\nHorror and darkness must that bower entwine.\"\n\nUnder his head the maiden put her arm\nAnd knelt beside half leaning on his breast;\nAs soul and body she would shield all harm\nFrom him whose love had made her being blest;\nAnd well the healing of her eyes might charm\nHis doubting thoughts again to trusting rest.\nHe drew and hid her face his heart upon\nThen spoke with low voice sounding changeless on.\n\nStrange words they were and fearful that he spake;\nThe maiden moved not once nor once replied;\nAnd ever as he spoke the wind did make\nA feebler moan until away it died;\nThen the rain ceased and not a movement brake\nThe silence save the clock that did divide\nThe hours into quick moments sparks of time\nScorching the soul that watcheth for the chime.\n\nHe spoke of sins that pride had caused in him;\nOf sufferings merciful and wanderings wild;\nOf fainting noontides and of oceans dim;\nOf earthly beauty that had oft beguiled;\nAnd then the sudden storm and contest grim;\nFrom each emerging new-born more a child;\nWandering again throughout the teaching earth\nNo rest attaining only a new birth.\n\n\"But when I find a heart that's like to mine\nWith love to live through the unloving hour\nFolded in faith like violets that have lien\nFolded in warm earth till the sunny shower\nCalleth them forth; thoughts with my thoughts to twine\nWeaving around us both a fragrant bower\nWhere we within may sleep together drawn\nFolded in love until the morning dawn;\n\n\"Then shall I rest my weary day's work o'er\nA deep sleep bathing steeping all my soul\nDissolving out the earth-stains evermore.\nThou too shalt sleep with me and be made whole.\nAll all time's billows over us shall pour\nThen ebb away and far beneath us roll:\nWe shall behold them like a stormy lake\n'Neath the clear height of peace where we awake.\"\n\nHer face on his her lips on his lips pressed\nWas the sole answer that the maiden made.\nWith both his arms he held her to his breast;\n'Twas but a moment; yet before he said\nOne other word of power to strengthen lest\nShe should give way amid the trial dread\nThe clock gave out the warning to the hour\nAnd on the thatch fell sounds as of a shower.\n\nOne long kiss and the maiden rose. A fear\nFell like a shadow dim upon her heart\nA trembling as at something ghostly near;\nBut she was bold for they were not to part.\nThen the youth rose his cheek pale his eyes clear;\nAnd helped the maid whose trembling hands did thwart\nHer haste to tie her gathered mantle's fold;\nThen forth they went into the midnight cold.\n\nThe moon was sunken low in the dim west\nCurled upwards on the steep horizon's brink\nA leaf of glory falling to its rest.\nThe maiden's hand still trembling scarce could link\nHer to his side; but his arm round her waist\nStole gently; so she walked and did not sink;\nHer hand on his right side soon held him fast\nAnd so together wound they onward passed.\n\nAnd clinging to his side she felt full well\nThe strong and measured beating of his heart;\nBut as the floating moon aye lower fell\nSlowly she felt its bounding force depart\nTill like a throbbing bird; nor can she tell\nWhether it beats at length; and with a start\nShe felt the arm relax around her flung\nAnd on her circling arm he leaned and hung.\n\nBut as his steps more and more feeble grow\nShe feels her strength and courage rise amain.\nHe lifted up his head; the moon was low\nAlmost on the world's edge. A smile of pain\nWas on his lips as his large eyes turned slow\nSeeking for hers; which like a heavy rain\nPoured love on him in many a love-lit gleam.\nSo they walked like two souls linked by one dream.\n\nHanging his head behind each came a hound\nWith slow and noiseless paws upon the road.\nWhat is that shining on the weedy ground?\nNought but the bright eyes of the dingy toad.\nThe silent pines range every way around;\nA deep stream on the left side hardly flowed.\nTheir path is towards the moon dying alone--\nIt touches the horizon dips is gone.\n\nIts last gleam fell upon dim glazed eyes;\nAn old man tottered feebly in her hold\nStooping with bended knees that could not rise;\nNor longer could his arm her waist infold.\nThe maiden trembled; but through this disguise\nHer love beheld what never could grow old;\nAnd so the aged man she young and warm\nClasped closer yet with her supporting arm.\n\nTill with short dragging steps he turned aside\nInto a closer thicket of tall firs\nWhose bare straight slender stems behind them hide\nA smooth grey rock. Not a pine-needle stirs\nTill they go in. Then a low wind blows wide\nO'er their cone-tops. It swells until it whirrs\nThrough the long stems as if aeolian chords\nFor moulding mystic sounds in lack of words.\n\nBut as they entered by a narrow cleft\nInto the rock's heart suddenly it ceased;\nAnd the tall pines stood still as if bereft\nOf a strong passion or from pain released;\nOnce more they wove their strange dark moveless weft\nO'er the dull midnight sky; and in the East\nA mist arose and clomb the skyey stairs;\nAnd like sad thoughts the bats came unawares.\n\n'Tis a dark chamber for the bridal night\nO poor pale saviour bride! A faint rush-lamp\nHe kindled with his shaking hands; its light\nPainted a tiny halo on the damp\nThat filled the cavern to its unseen height\nLike a death-candle on the midnight swamp.\nWithin each side the entrance lies a hound\nWith liquid light his green eyes gleaming round.\n\nA couch just raised above the rocky floor\nOf withered oak and beech-leaves that the wind\nHad tossed about till weary covered o'er\nWith skins of bears which feathery mosses lined\nAnd last of lambs with wool long soft and hoar\nReceived the old man's bended limbs reclined.\nGently the maiden did herself unclothe\nAnd lay beside him trusting and not loath.\n\nAgain the storm among the trees o'erhead;\nThe hounds pricked up their ears their eyes flashed fire;\nSeemed to the trembling maiden that a tread\nLight and yet clear amid the wind's loud ire\nAs dripping feet o'er smooth slabs hither sped\nCame often up as with a fierce desire\nTo enter but as oft made quick retreat;\nAnd looking forth the hounds stood on their feet.\n\nThen came half querulous a whisper old\nFeeble and hollow as from out a chest:\n\"Take my face on your bosom I am cold.\"\nStraightway she bared her bosom's white soft nest;\nAnd then his head her gentle hands love-bold\nWith its grey withered face against her pressed.\nAh maiden! it was very old and chill\nBut thy warm heart beneath it grew not still.\n\nAgain the wind falls and the rain-clouds pour\nRushing to earth; and soon she heard the sound\nOf a fierce torrent through the thick night roar;\nThe lamp went out as by the darkness drowned;\nNo more the morn will dawn oh never more!\nLike centuries the feeble hours went round;\nDead night lay o'er her clasping as she lay\nWithin her holy place unburied clay.\n\nThe hours stood still; her life sunk down so low\nThat but for wretchedness no life she knew.\nA charnel wind sung on a moaning--_No;_\nEarth's centre was the grave from which it blew;\nEarth's loves and beauties all passed sighing slow\nRoses and lilies children friends the few;\nBut so transparent blanched in every part\nShe saw the pale worm lying in each heart.\n\nAnd worst of all O death of gladsome life!\nA voice within awoke and cried: In sooth\nThere is no need of sorrow care and strife;\nFor all that women beauty call and truth\nIs but a glow from hearts with fancy rife\nPassing away with slowly fading youth.\nGaze on them narrowly they waver blot;\nLook at them fixedly and they are not.\n\nAnd all the answer the poor child could make\nLay in the tightened grasp of her two hands;\nShe felt as if she lay mouldering awake\nWithin the sepulchre's fast stony bands\nAnd cared not though she died but for his sake.\nAnd the dark horror grew like drifting sands\nTill nought seemed beautiful not God nor light;\nAnd yet she braved the false denying night.\n\nBut after hope was dead a faint light streak\nCrept through a crevice in the rocky wall;\nIt fell upon her bosom and his cheek.\nFrom God's own eye that light-glance seemed to fall.\nBackward he drew his head and did not speak\nBut gazed with large deep eyes angelical\nUpon her face. Old age had fled away--\nYouth everlasting in her bosom lay.\n\nWith a low cry of joy closer she crept\nAnd on his bosom hid a face that glowed\nSeeking amends for terror while he slept.\nShe had been faithful: the beloved owed\nLove youth and gladness unto her who wept\nGushingly on his heart. Her warm tears flowed\nA baptism for the life that would not cease;\nAnd when the sun arose they slept in peace.", "A PRAYER FOR THE PAST": "  All sights and sounds of every year\nAll groups and forms each leaf and gem\nAre thine O God nor need I fear\nTo speak to Thee of them.\n\n  Too great thy heart is to despise;\nThy day girds centuries about;\nFrom things which we count small thine eyes\nSee great things looking out.\n\n  Therefore this prayerful song I sing\nMay come to Thee in ordered words;\nTherefore its sweet sounds need not cling\nIn terror to their chords.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  I know that nothing made is lost;\nThat not a moon hath ever shone\nThat not a cloud my eyes hath crost\nBut to my soul hath gone.\n\n  That all the dead years garnered lie\nIn this gem-casket my dim soul;\nAnd that thy hand may once apply\nThe key that opes the whole.\n\n  But what lies dead in me yet lives\nIn Thee whose Parable is--Time\nAnd Worlds and Forms and Sound that gives\nWords and the music-chime.\n\n  And after my next coming birth\nThe new child's prayer will rise to Thee:\nTo hear again the sounds of Earth\nIts sights again to see.\n\n  With child's glad eyes to see once more\nThe visioned glories of the gloom\nWith climbing suns and starry store\nCeiling my little room.\n\n  O call again the moons that glide\nBehind old vapours sailing slow;\nLost sights of solemn skies that slide\nO'er eyelids sunken low.\n\n  Show me the tides of dawning swell\nAnd lift the world's dim eastern eye\nAnd the dark tears that all night fell\nWith radiance glorify.\n\n  First I would see oh sore bereft!\nMy father's house my childhood's home;\nWhere the wild snow-storms raved and left\nWhite mounds of frozen foam.\n\n  Till going out one dewy morn\nA man was turning up the mould;\nAnd in our hearts the spring was born\nCrept hither through the cold.\n\n  And with the glad year I would go\nThe troops of daisies round my feet;\nFlying the kite or in the glow\nOf arching summer heat\n\n  Outstretched in fear upon the bank\nLest gazing up on awful space\nI should fall down into the blank\nFrom off the round world's face.\n\n  And let my brothers be with me\nTo play our old games yet again;\nAnd all should go as lovingly\nAs now that we are men.\n\n  If over Earth the shade of Death\nPassed like a cloud's wide noiseless wing\nWe'd tell a secret in low breath:\n\"Mind 'tis a _dream_ of Spring.\n\n  \"And in this dream our brother's gone\nUpstairs;

Year is dead at last;\nHis corpse 'mid the ruins of Time is cast\nWhere the mouldering wrecks of lost Thought lie\nAnd the rich-hued blossoms of Passion die\nTo a withering grass that droops o'er his grave\nThe shadowy Titan's refuge cave.\nStrange lights from pale moony Memory lie\nOn the weedy columns beneath its eye;\nAnd strange is the sound of the ghostlike breeze\nIn the lingering leaves on the skeleton trees;\nAnd strange is the sound of the falling shower\nWhen the clouds of dead pain o'er the spirit lower;\nUnheard in the home he inhabiteth\nThe land where all lost things are gathered by Death.\n\nAlone I reclined in the closing year;\nVoice nor breathing nor step was near;\nAnd I said in the weariness of my breast:\nWeary Old Year thou art going to rest;\nO weary Old Year I would I might be\nOne hour alone in thy dying with thee!\nWould thou wert a spirit whose low lament\nMight mix with the sighs from my spirit sent;\nFor I am weary of man and life;\nWeary of restless unchanging strife;\nWeary of change that is ever changing;\nWeary of thought that is ever ranging\nEver falling in efforts vain\nFluttering upspringing from earth again\nStruggling once more through the darkness to wing\nThat hangs o'er the birthplace of everything\nAnd choked yet again in the vapour's breast\nSinking once more to a helpless rest.\nI am weary of tears that scarce are dry\nEre their founts are filled as the cloud goes by;\nWeary of feelings where each in the throng\nMocks at the rest as they crowd along;\nWhere Pride over all like a god on high\nSits enshrined in his self-complacency;\nWhere Selfishness crawls the snake-demon of ill\nThe least suspected where busiest still;\nWhere all things evil and painful entwine\nAnd all in their hate and their sorrow are mine:\nO weary Old Year I would I might be\nOne hour by thy dying to weep with thee!\n\nPeace the soul's slumber was round me shed;\nThe sleep where thought lives but its pain is dead;\nAnd my musings led me a spirit-band\nThrough the wide realms of their native land;\nTill I stood by the couch of the mighty dying\nA lonely shore in the midnight lying.\nHe lay as if he had laid him to sleep\nAnd the stars above him their watch did keep;\nAnd the mournful wind with the dreamy sigh\nThe homeless wanderer of the sky\nWas the only attendant whose gentle breath\nSoothed him yet on the couch of death;\nAnd the dying waves of the heedless sea\nFell at his feet most listlessly.\n\nBut he lay in peace with his solemn eye\nLooking far through the mists of futurity.\nA smile gleamed over the death-dew that lay\nOn his withered cheek as life ebbed away.\nA darkness lay on his forehead vast;\nBut the light of expectancy o'er it was cast--\nA light that shone from the coming day\nTravelling unseen to the East away.\nIn his cloudy robes that lay shadowing wide\nI stretched myself motionless by his side;\nAnd his eyes with their calm unimpassioned power\nSoothing my heart like an evening shower\nLed in a spectral far-billowing train\nThe hours of the Past through my spirit again.\n\nThere were fears of evil whose stony eyes\nFroze joy in its gushing melodies.\nSome floated afar on thy tranquil wave\nAnd the heart looked up from its search for a grave;\nWhile others as guests to the bosom came\nAnd left its wild children more sorrow less shame;\nFor the death-look parts from their chilling brow\nAnd they bless the heads that before them bow;\nAnd floating away in the far-off gloom.\nThankfulness follows them to their tomb.\nThere were Hopes that found not a place to rest\nTheir foot 'mid the rush of all-ocean's breast;\nAnd home to the sickening heart flew back\nBut changed into sorrows upon their track;\nAnd through the moan of the darkening sea\nBearing no leaf from the olive-tree.\nThere were joys that looked forth with their maiden eyes\nAnd smiled and were gone with a sad surprise;\nAnd the Love of the Earthly whose beauteous form\nBeckoned me on through sunshine and storm;\nBut when the bounding heart sprang high\nMeeting her smile with a speechless sigh\nThe arms sunk home with a painful start\nClasping a vacancy to the heart.\n\nAnd the voice of the dying I seem to hear\nBut whether his breathing is in mine ear\nOr the sounds of the breaking billows roll\nThe lingering accents upon my soul\nI know not; but thus they seem to bear\nReproof to my soul for its faint despair:--\nBlame not life it is scarce begun;\nBlame not mankind thyself art one.\nAnd change is holy oh! blame it never;\nThy soul shall live by its changing ever;\nNot the bubbling change of a stagnant pool\nBut the change of a river flowing and full;\nWhere all that is noble and good will grow\nMightier still as the full tides flow;\nTill it joins the hidden the boundless sea\nRolling through depths of Eternity.\nBlame not thy thought that it cannot reach\nThat which the Infinite must teach;\nBless thy God that the Word came nigh\nTo guide thee home to thy native sky\nWhere all things are homely and glorious too\nAnd the children are wondering and glad and true.\n\nAnd he pointed away to an Eastern star\nThat gleamed through his robes o'er the ocean afar;\nAnd I knew that a star had looked o'er the rim\nOf my world that lay all dreary and dim;\nAnd was slowly dissolving the darkness deep\nWhich like evil nurse had soothed me to sleep;\nAnd rising higher and shining clearer\nWould draw the day-spring ever nearer\nTill the sunshine of God burst full on the morn\nAnd every hill and valley would start\nWith the joy of light and new gratitude born\nTo Him who had led me home to His heart;\nAnd all things that lived in my world within\nWith the gladness of tears to His feet come in;\nAnd the false Self be banished with fiends to dwell\nIn the gloomiest haunts of his native hell;\nAnd Pride that ruled like a god above\nBe trod 'neath the feet of triumphant Love.\n\nAnd again he pointed across the sea\nAnd another vision arose in me:\nAnd I knew I walked an ocean of fear\nYet of safety too for the Master was near;\nAnd every wave of sorrow or dread\nO'er which strong faith should upraise my head\nWould show from the height of its troubled crest\nStill nearer and nearer the Land of Rest.\nAnd when the storm-spray on the wind should arise\nAnd with tears unbidden should blind mine eyes\nAnd hide from my vision the Home of Love\nI knew I must look to the star above\nAnd the mists of Passion would quickly flee\nAnd the storm would faint to serenity.\n\nAnd again it seemed as if words found scope\nThe sorrowing words of a farewell Hope:\n\"I will meet thee again in that deathless land\nWhenever thy foot shall imprint the strand;\nAnd the loveliest things that have here been mine\nShall there in eternal beauty shine;\nFor there I shall live and never die\nPart of a glorious Eternity;\nFor the death of Time is _To be forgot_\nAnd I go where oblivion entereth not.\"\n\nHe was dead. He had gone to the rest of his race\nWith a sad smile frozen upon his face.\nDeadness clouded his eyes.
