down my cheeks the tears coursed fleetly\n      But how it chanced, I could not tell.\n\n    There over me had crept a vision:\n      Methought I was again a child,\n    And in my mother\u2019s chamber sitting\n    In silence, by the lamp-light flitting,\n    And reading fairy tales befitting,\n      Whilst outside roar\u2019d the tempest wild.\n\n    The tales began with life to glimmer,\n

Still sorrow lay on all,\n    And secret fearful grief. With strange emotion,\n    Wellnigh with looks of pity, on me gazed they\n    Till my own soul with terror was pervaded,\n    As though foreboding some unknown misfortune.\n    Old Margaret I straightway recognized,\n    Gazed on her fixedly, but yet she spake not.\n    \u201cWhere is Maria?\u201d ask\u2019d I, yet she spake not,\n    But softly seized my hand, and led me on\n    Through many a long and brightly-lighted chamber,\n    Where splendour, pomp, and deathlike silence reign\u2019d\n    And to a darksome room at length she brought me,\n    And, with her face averted from me, pointed\n    Toward the form that sat upon the sofa.\n    \u201cArt thou Maria?\u201d ask\u2019d I.

From her light eyes tears in torrents\n    Weeps the lady, sadly musing,\n    On Almansor\u2019s dark-brown tresses,--\n    And his lips begin to quiver.\n\n    And he dreams he\u2019s once more

  That no longer will they bear it,\n    And they totter and they tremble.\n\n    And they wildly fall together,\n    Pale turn all the priests and people,\n    Crashing falls the dome upon them,\n

piled high\n    With the costliest treasures of earth, draw nigh.\n\n    When the camels he sees with their heavy piles,\n    The soul of the King in secret smiles;\n    But in public in truth he always deplores\n    That his storehouses serve not to hold all his stores.\n\n    Yet these storehouses all are so lofty and spacious,\n    So full of magnificence, so capacious,\n    The reality\u2019s splendour surpasses in glory\n    The Arabian Nights\u2019 most wondrous story.\n\n    The \u201cCastle of Indra\u201d call they the hall\n    In which are display\u2019d the deities

compound of men and animals dread,\n    With many a hand and many a head.\n\n    In the \u201cHall of purple\u201d one wond\u2019ringly sees\n    Some thirteen hundred coral trees,\n    As big as

With perfumes they rub him, and otto of roses\n    On his head a chaplet of flowers reposes,\n    The richest shawls that are made in the East\n    As carpets serve for the dignified beast.\n\n    The happiest life appears to be his,\n    But no one on earth contented is;\n    The noble creature,--one cannot tell why,--\n    Gives way to a deep despondency.\n\n    The melancholy monster white\n    Is wretched, all this profusion despite;\n    They fain would enliven and cheer him again,\n    But all their cleverest efforts are vain.\n\n    In vain with singing and springing there come\n    The bayaderes; the kettle drum\n    And cornet in vain the musicians play,\n    But nothing can make the elephant gay.\n\n    As matters continue to go on badly,\n    The heart of Mahawasant beats

Then Cortez\n\n    Seized himself the precious banner,\n    He, the leader, and he bore it\n    On his steed till tow\u2019rd the evening,\n    When the fight at length was over.\n\n    On that day a hundred Spaniards\n    Fell, and sixty in addition;\n    Eighty more alive were taken\n    By the Indians\u2019 cruel hands.\n\n    Many of them sorely wounded,\n    Who ere long their breath surrender\u2019d\n    And a dozen horses, too, were\n    Partly kill\u2019d and partly captured.\n\n    Cortez and his army only\n    Just at evening gain\u2019d the shelter\n    Of the shore, a seacoast planted\n    Niggardly with weeping willows.\n\n\n2.\n\n    When the battle day is over,\n    Comes the frantic night of triumph\n    So in Mexico a hundred\n    Thousand lamps of joy are flaring;\n\n    Hundred thousand lamps of joy, with\n    Woodpine torches, pitch-ring fires,\n    Throw a light as clear as daylight\n    Over palaces and temples,\n\n    And guildhouses,--likewise over\n    Vitzliputzli\u2019s splendid temple,\n    Idol-fortress built of red brick,\n    Strangely like the old Egyptian,\n\n    Babylonian, and Assyrian\n    Monster buildings so colossal,\n    As we see them in the pictures\n    Of the English Henry Martin.\n\n    Yes, it is the same broad staircase,\n    So exceeding broad, that on it\n    Many thousand Mexicans\n    Up and down are walking freely,\n\n    Whilst upon the steps are lying\n    Mighty troops of savage warriors,\n    Banqueting in joyous fashion,\n    Flush\u2019d with triumph and with palm-wine.\n\n    This great staircase leadeth upwards\n    Like a zigzag to the platform,\n    By a balustrade surrounded\n    At the summit of the temple.\n\n    There, upon his altar-throne,\n    Sits the mighty Vitzliputzli,\n    Mexico\u2019s bloodthirsty wargod.--\n    He is but an evil monster,\n\n    But so droll is his exterior,\n    Full of carvings, and so childish,\n    That despite our inward horror\n    It must needs excite our laughter.\n\n    His appearance altogether\n    Brought to mind a combination\n    Of the \u201cDance of Death\u201d at Basle,\n    And the Mannekin at Brussels.\n\n    On the god\u2019s left side his priests are\n    Station\u2019d, on his right the people;\n    Ornaments of colour\u2019d feathers\n    Are to-day the former wearing.\n\n    On the altar-stairs of marble\n    Squats a man a hundred years old;\n    On his chin and skull no hair is,\n    And he wears a scarlet waistcoat.\n\n    He\u2019s the priest of sacrifices,\n    And his bloody knife he\u2019s whetting;\n    As he whets, he grins, and ofttimes\n    Leers upon the god above him.\n\n    Vitzliputzli seems the glances\n    Of his servant to appreciate,\n    And he twitches every eyelash,\n    And his lips at times he twitches.\n\n    On the altar steps squat also\n    The musicians of the temple,\n    Kettle-drummers, cowhorn blowers--\n    Loud the clatter, loud the tooting!\n\n    Loud the clatter, loud the tooting!\n    And the Mexican Te Deum\n    Rises up in noisy chorus,\n    As if many cats were mewing--\n\n    As if many cats were mewing,\n    But of that enlarged description\n    Which are \u201ctiger-cats\u201d entitled,\n    And, instead of mice, eat people!\n\n    When the nightwind carries with it\n    These loud noises to the seashore,\n    The poor Spaniards there encamping\n    Feel sensations far from pleasant.\n\n    Sadly \u2019neath the weeping willows\n    Are the Spaniards still remaining,\n    Gazing tow\u2019rd the distant city\n    Which within the dark sea water\n\n    Mirrors back, in sheer derision,\n    All the flames of former pleasure--\n    There they stand, as in the pit\n    Of a vast gigantic playhouse,\n\n    Vitzliputzli\u2019s temple\u2019s radiant\n    Platform serving as the stage\n    Where they act a tragic myst\u2019ry\n    To commemorate their triumph.\n\n    \u201cHuman sacrifice\u201d the play is,\n    Old, full old, its plot, its fable;\n    But the piece is not so fearful\n    In the Christian treatment of it.\n\n    For into the blood is red wine,\n    And into the actual body\n    Is a thin and harmless wafer\n    Transubstantiated truly.\n\n    \u2019Mongst these savages at present\n    Was the joke in downright earnest\n    Taken up; they fed on flesh,\n    And the blood was human blood.\n\n    This time \u2019twas indeed the pure blood\n    Of old Christians, which had never\n    Never mingled with the baser\n    Blood of Jews or of Moriscos.\n\n    O be joyful, Vitzliputzli!\n    For to-day \u2019tis Spanish blood,\n    And thou mayst refresh thy nostrils\n    With its warm scent greedily.\n\n    Eighty Spaniards will be slaughter\u2019d\n    On this day to do thee honour--\n    Proud repast to grace the table\n    Of thy priests, who flesh delight in.\n\n    For the priest is but a mortal,\n    And poor man, unhappy glutton,\n    Cannot, like the gods, live only\n    On sweet smells and savoury odours.\n\n    Hark! the death-drum now is beating,\n    And the evil cowhorn screeches!\n    They proclaim the\u2019 approaching advent\n    Of the victims\u2019 sad procession.\n\n    Eighty Spaniards, vilely naked,\n    With their hands securely fasten\u2019d\n    To their backs, are harshly driven\n    Up the temple\u2019s lofty staircase.\n\n    And to Vitzliputzli\u2019s image\n    They must bow the knee right humbly,\n    And must dance the wildest dances,\n    Forcibly constrain\u2019d by tortures,\n\n    All so terrible and fearful,\n    That their madden\u2019d screams of anguish\n    Overpow\u2019r the whole collective\n    Cannibals\u2019 wild charivari.\n\n    Poor spectators by the ocean!\n    Cortez and his warlike comrades\n    But too plainly could distinguish\n    All their friends\u2019 loud cries of torment.\n\n    On the stage, too clearly lighted,\n    They could see, alas! too plainly,\n    Every figure, every gesture,--\n    See the knife and see the blood.\n\n    Then from off their heads their helmets\n    Silently they took, and kneeling,\n    Chaunted they the death-psalm sadly,\n    And they sang the De Profundis.\n\n    \u2019Mongst the number of the victims\n    Was young Raimond de Mendoza,\n    Offspring of the lovely abbess,\n    Cortez\u2019 first and youthful love.\n\n    When he on the stripling\u2019s bosom\n    Saw the well-remember\u2019d locket\n    Which enclosed his mother\u2019s portrait,\n    Bitter, bitter tears wept Cortez--\n\n    But from off his eyes he wiped them\n    With his buffalo\u2019s hard gauntlet--\n    Deeply sigh\u2019d, and sang in chorus\n    With the others: Miserere!\n\n\n3.\n\n    Now the stars are glimm\u2019ring paler,\n    And the morning mists are rising\n    From the ocean-flood, like spirits\n    Dragging their white shrouds behind them.\n\n    Feasts and lights are all extinguish\u2019d\n    In the temple of the idol,\n    Where, upon the blood-soak\u2019d pavement,\n    Priest and laity lie snoring.\n\n    None are waking, save Red Jacket.\n    By the last lamp\u2019s flickering glimmer,\n    Sickly grinning, grimly jesting,\n    Thus the priest his god addresses:\n\n    \u201cVitzliputzli, Putzlivitzli!\n    \u201cDarling god, my Vitzliputzli!\n    \u201cThou to-day hast had amusement,\n    \u201cAnd has smelt a fragrant odour!\n\n    \u201cSpanish blood to-day we offer\u2019d,\n    \u201cO how savourily steam\u2019d it!\n    \u201cAnd thy fine and dainty nostrils\n    \u201cSuck\u2019d the scent in, full of rapture!\n\n    \u201cWe\u2019ll to-morrow slay the horses,\n    \u201cNeighing noble monsters are they,\n    \u201cOffspring of the tempest spirits\u2019\n    \u201cAmorous toying with the seacow.\n\n    \u201cIf thou\u2019lt gracious be, I\u2019ll slaughter\n    \u201cIn thine honour my two grandsons,\n    \u201cPretty children,--sweet their blood is,--\n    \u201cMy old age\u2019s only pleasure.\n\n    \u201cBut indeed thou must be gracious,\n    \u201cAnd must grant us further triumphs,\n    \u201cLet us conquer, darling godhead,\n    \u201cPutzlivitzli, Vitzliputzli!\n\n    \u201cAll our enemies destroy thou,\n    \u201cAll these strangers who from distant\n    \u201cAnd still undiscover\u2019d countries\n    \u201cHither came across the ocean--\n\n    \u201cWherefore did they leave their dwellings?\n    \u201cWas it crime or hunger drove them?\n    \u201c\u2018Stop at home and live in quiet\u2019\n    \u201cIs a sensible old proverb.\n\n    \u201cWhat is their desire?

They pass\u2019d me by night\n    Like fleeting shadows, mysteriously light.\n\n    They are thin as a spindle, and long as a baby,\n    With breeches and waistcoats tight-fitting as may be,\n    Of scarlet colours, embroider\u2019d with gold;\n    Their faces are sickly and yellow and old.\n\n    A golden crown, with rubies all over,\n    The head of each of their number doth cover;\n    The whole of these vain conceited elves\n    Quite absolute monarchs consider themselves.\n\n    That they are not burnt in the fire is truly\n    A great piece of art, I acknowledge it duly;\n    And yet the uninflammable wight\n    Is far from being a true fire-sprite.\n\n    The sharpest woodspirits are mandrakes however;\n    Short legs have these bearded mannikins clever;\n    They have old men\u2019s faces, the length of a span,\n    But whence they proceed, is a secret to man.\n\n    When head over heels in the moonlight they tumble,\n    They remind one of roots in their nature quite humble;\n    But as my welfare they always have sought,\n    Their origin really to me matters nought.\n\n    In small acts of witchcraft they gave me instructions,\n    How to exorcise flames, ply the birds with seductions,\n    And also to pluck on Midsummer night\n    The root that makes one invisible quite.\n\n    They taught me the stars and strange signs--how astraddle\n    To ride on the winds without any saddle,\n    And Runic sentences, able to call\n    The dead from out of their silent graves all.\n\n    They also taught me the whistle mysterious\n    That serves to deceive the woodpecker serious,\n    And makes him give us the spurge, to show\n    Where secret treasures are hidden below.\n\n    The words that \u2019tis needful for people to mutter\n    When digging for treasure, they taught me to utter;\n    But all in vain, for I ne\u2019er got by heart\n    The treasure-digger\u2019s wonderful art.\n\n    For money in fact I then cared not a tittle,\n    My wants were soon satisfied, being but little;\n    I possess\u2019d many castles in Spain\u2019s fair land,\n    The income from which came duly to hand.\n\n    O charming time, when the heaven\u2019s high arches\n    With fiddles were hung, when elfin marches\n    And nixes\u2019 dances and cobolds\u2019 glad play\n    My story-drunk heart enchanted all day!\n\n    O charming time, when into auspicious\n    Triumphal arches the foliage delicious\n    Appear\u2019d to be twining!

the castle at Segovia.\n\n    These state banquets just the same are\n    Everywhere, and at the tables\n    Of all princes sov\u2019reign tedium\n    Yawns with uncontested vigour.\n\n    Everywhere the same silk rabble,\n    Gaily dress\u2019d, and proudly nodding,\n    Like a bed of gorgeous tulips;\n    Different only are the sauces.\n\n    Whispers all the time and buzzing\n    Lull the senses like the poppy,\n    Till the sound of trumpets wakes us\n    From our state of chewing deafness.\n\n    Near me, by good luck, was sitting\n    Don Diego Albuquerque,\n    From whose lips the conversation\n    Flow\u2019d in one unbroken torrent.\n\n    He with wondrous skill related\n    Bloody stories of the palace,\n    Of the times of old Don Pedro,\n    Whom they call\u2019d the cruel monarch.\n\n    When I ask\u2019d him why Don Pedro\n    Caused his brother Don Fredrego\n    To be secretly beheaded,\n    With a sigh my neighbour answer\u2019d:\n\n    Ah, Se\u00f1or! the tales believe not\n    Jingled on their vile guitars by\n    Balladsingers and muledrivers\n    In posadas, beershops, taverns.\n\n    And believe not what they chatter\n    Of the love of Don Fredrego\n    And Don Pedro\u2019s wife so beauteous,\n    Donna Blanca of Bourbon.\n\n    \u2019Twas not to the husband\u2019s jealous\n    Feelings, but to his low envy\n    That as victim fell Fredrego,\n    Chief of Calatrava\u2019s order.\n\n    For the crime Don Pedro never\n    Would forgive him, was his glory,--\n    Glory such as Donna Fama\n    Loves with trumpet-tongue to herald--\n\n    Never could Don Pedro pardon\n    His magnanimous high spirit,\n    Or the beauty of his person,\n    Which was but his spirit\u2019s image.\n\n    Still within my memory blossoms\n    That slim graceful hero-flower;\n    Ne\u2019er shall I forget those lovely\n    Dream-like, soft and youthful features.\n\n    They were just of that description\n    That the fairies take delight in,\n    And a fable-seeming secret\n    Spoke from all those features plainly.\n\n    Blue his eyes were, their enamel\n    Being dazzling as a jewel,\n    But a jewel\u2019s staring hardness\n    Seem\u2019d reflected in them likewise.\n\n    Black his hair was in its colour,\n    Bluish black, and strangely glistening,\n    And in fair luxuriant tresses\n    Falling down upon his shoulders.\n\n    In the charming town of Coimbra\n    Which he from the Moors had taken,\n    For the last time I beheld him,\n    In this world,--unhappy prince!\n\n    He was coming from Alcanzor,\n    Through the narrow streets fast riding\n    Many a fair young Moorish maiden\n    Eyed him from her latticed window.\n\n    O\u2019er his head his helm-plume floated\n    Gallantly, and yet his mantle\u2019s\n    Rigid Calatrava cross\n    Scared away all loving fancies.\n\n    By his side, and gaily wagging\n    With his tail, his favourite Allan\n    Sprang,--a beast of proud descent,\n    And whose home was the Sierra.\n\n    He, despite his size gigantic,\n    Was as nimble as a reindeer;\n    Noble was his head to look at,\n    Though the fox\u2019s it resembled.\n\n    Snow-white and like silk in softness,\n    Down his back his long hair floated,\n    And with rubies bright incrusted\n    Was his broad and golden collar.\n\n    It was said this collar hid the\n    Talisman fidelity;\n    Never did the faithful creature\n    Leave the side of his dear master.\n\n    O that fierce fidelity!\n    It excites my startled feelings,\n    When I think how \u2019twas made public\n    Here, before our frighten\u2019d presence.\n\n    O that day so full of horror!\n    Here, within this hall, it happen\u2019d,\n    And as I to-day am sitting,\n    At the monarch\u2019s table sat I.\n\n    At the high end of the table,\n    Where to-day young Don Henrico\n    Gaily tipples with the flower\n    Of Castilian chivalry,\n\n    On that day there sat Don Pedro\n    Darkly silent, and beside him,\n    Proudly radiant as a goddess,\n    Sat Maria de Padilla.\n\n    At the table\u2019s lower end, where\n    Here to-day we see the lady\n    With the linen frill capacious,\n    Like a white plate in appearance.\n\n    Whilst her yellow face is gilded\n    With a smile of sour complexion,\n    Like the citron that is lying\n    On the plate already mention\u2019d,--\n\n    At the table\u2019s lower end here\n    Was a place remaining empty;\n    Some great guest of lofty station\n    Seem\u2019d the golden seat to wait for.\n\n    Don Fredrego was the guest, for\n    Whom the golden seat was destined;\n    Yet he came not,--ah! now know we\n    But too well why thus he tarried.\n\n    Ah! that selfsame hour the wicked\n    Deed of blood was consummated,\n    And the innocent young hero\n    Suddenly attack\u2019d and basely\n\n    By Don Pedro\u2019s myrmidons,\n    Tightly bound, and quickly hurried\n    To a dreary castle dungeon\n    Lighted only by some torches.\n\n    Executioners stood ready,\n    And their bloody chief was with them,\n    Who, upon his axe while leaning,\n    Thus with sadden\u2019d look address\u2019d him:\n\n    \u201cNow, Grand Master of San Jago,\n    \u201cNow must thou for death prepare thee;\n    \u201cJust one quarter of an hour\n    \u201cStill is left for thee to pray in.\u201d\n\n    Don Fredrego then knelt humbly,\n    And he pray\u2019d with pious calmness,\n    And then said: \u201cI now have finish\u2019d,\u201d\n    And received the stroke of death.\n\n    In the very selfsame moment\n    That the head roll\u2019d on the pavement,\n    Faithful Allan, who had follow\u2019d\n    All unseen, sprang quickly to it.\n\n    With his teeth the head straight seized he\n    By the long luxuriant tresses,\n    And with this much valued booty\n    Shot away with speed of magic.\n\n    Agonizing shouts resounded\n    Everywhere as on he hasten\u2019d,\n    Through the passages and chambers,\n    Sometimes upstairs, sometimes downstairs.\n\n    Since the banquet of Belshazzar\n    Never company at table\n    Was so utterly confounded\n    As was ours that fill\u2019d this hall then,\n\n    When the monstrous creature leapt in,\n    With the head of Don Fredrego,\n    Which he with his teeth was dragging\n    By the dripping bloody tresses.\n\n    On the seat which, being destined\n    For his master, still was empty,\n    Sprang the dog and like a plaintiff\n    Held the head before our faces.\n\n    Ah! it was the well-remember\u2019d\n    Hero\u2019s features, but still paler\n    And more solemn now when dead,\n    And all-fearfully encircled\n\n    By the locks in black luxuriance,\n    Which stood up as did the savage\n    Serpent-headdress of Medusa,\n    Turning into stone through terror.\n\n    Yes, turn\u2019d into stone felt all then,\n    Wildly stared we on each other,\n    And each tongue was mute and palsied\n    Both by etiquette and horror.\n\n    But Maria de Padilla\n    Broke the universal silence;\n    Wringing hands, and sobbing loudly,\n    She forebodingly lamented:\n\n    \u201cNow it will be said \u2019twas I that\n    \u201cBrought about this cruel murder;\n    \u201cRancour will assail my children,\n    \u201cMy poor innocent young children!--\u201d\n\n    Don Diego interrupted\n    At this place his tale, observing\n    That the company had risen,\n    And the court the hall was leaving.\n\n    Kind and courteous in his manners,\n    Then the knight became my escort,\n    And we rambled on together\n    Through the ancient Gothic castle.\n\n    In the crossway which conducted\n    To the kennels of the monarch,\n    Which proclaimed themselves already\n    By far growling sounds and yelpings,\n\n    There I noticed, built up strongly\n    In the wall, and on the outside\n    Firmly fasten\u2019d by strong iron,\n    Like a cage, a narrow cell.\n\n    And inside it sat two human\n    Figures, two young boys appearing;\n    By the legs securely fetter\u2019d,\n    On the dirty straw they squatted.\n\n    Scarcely twelve years old the one seem\u2019d,\n    Scarcely older seem\u2019d the other;\n    Fair and noble were

one! smoking is forbidden,\n    \u201cFor to-day the Sabbath is.\n\n    \u201cBut at noon, in compensation,\n    \u201cThou a steaming dish shalt taste of,\n    \u201cWhich is perfectly delicious--\n    \u201cThou shall eat to-day some Schalet!\u201d\n\n    \u201cSchalet, beauteous spark immortal,\n    \u201cDaughter of Elysium!\u201d\n    Thus would Schiller\u2019s song have sung it,\n    Had he ever tasted Schalet.\n\n    Schalet is the food of heaven,\n    Which the Lord Himself taught Moses\n    How to cook, when on that visit\n    To the summit of Mount Sinai,\n\n    Where the Lord Almighty also\n    Every good religious doctrine\n    And the holy ten commandments\n    Publish\u2019d in a storm of lightning.\n\n    Schalet is the pure ambrosia\n    That the food of heaven composes--\n    Is the bread of Paradise;\n    And compared with food so glorious,\n\n    The ambrosia of the spurious\n    Heathen gods whom Greece once worshipp\u2019d\n    And were naught but muffled devils,\n    Was but wretched devil\u2019s dung.\n\n    When the prince this food hath tasted,\n    Gleams his eye as if transfigured,\n    And his waistcoat he unbuttons,\n    And he speaks with smiles of rapture:\n\n    \u201cHear I not the Jordan murmuring?\n    \u201cIs it not the gushing fountains\n    \u201cIn the palmy vale of Beth-El,\n    \u201cWhere the camels have their

mountain?\u201d\n\n    Yet the beauteous day fades quickly;\n    As with long and shadowy legs\n    Hastens on the fell enchantment\u2019s\n    Evil hour, the prince sighs sadly,\n\n    Feeling as though with his bosom\n    Icy witches\u2019 fingers grappled;\n    He\u2019s pervaded by the fear of\n    Canine metamorphosis.\n\n    To the prince then hands the princess\n    Her own golden box of spikenard;\n    Long he smells, once more desiring\n    To find comfort in sweet odours.\n\n    Next the parting drink the princess\n    Gives the prince--He hastily\n    Drinks, and in the goblet only\n    Some few drops are left untasted.\n\n    With them sprinkles he the table,\n    Then he takes a little waxlight,\n    And he dips it in the moisture\n    Till it crackles and goes out.", "A FRAGMENT": "1.\n\n    \u201cIf, Jerusalem, I ever\n    \u201cShould forget thee, let my tongue\n    \u201cTo my mouth\u2019s roof cleave, let also\n    \u201cMy right hand forget her cunning--\u201d\n\n    Words and melody are whirling\n    In my head to-day unceasing,\n    And methinks I hear sweet voices\n    Singing psalms, sweet human voices.\n\n    Often to the light come also\n    Beards of shadowy-long proportions;\n    Say, ye phantoms, which amongst you\n    Is Jehuda ben Halevy?\n\n    But they quickly hustle by me;\n    Spirits ever shun with terror\n    Exhortations of the living--\n    But I recognized him well.\n\n    Well I knew him by his pallid,\n    Haughty, high, and thoughtful forehead,\n    By his eyes so sweetly staring,\n    Viewing me with piercing sorrow.\n\n    But I recognized him mostly\n    By the enigmatic smile which\n    O\u2019er his fair rhymed lips was playing,\n    Such as none but poets boast of.\n\n    Years come on and years pass swiftly\n    Since Jehuda ben Halevy\n    Had his birth, have seven hundred\n    Years and fifty fleeted o\u2019er us.\n\n    At Toledo in Castile he\n    For the first time saw the light,\n    And the golden Tagus lull\u2019d him\n    In his cradle with its music.\n\n    His strict father the unfolding\n    Of his intellect full early\n    Cared for, and began his lessons\n    With the book of God, the Thora.\n\n    With his son he read this volume\n    In the\u2019 original, whose beauteous\n    Picturesque and hieroglyphic\n    Old Chaldean quarto pages\n\n    Spring from out the childish ages\n    Of our world, and for that reason\n    Smile so trustingly and sweetly\n    On each childlike disposition.\n\n    And this genuine ancient text\n    By the boy was likewise chanted\n    In the ancient and establish\u2019d\n    Sing-song fashion, known as Tropp.\n\n    And melodiously he gurgled\n    Those fat oily gutturals;\n    Like a very bird he warbled\n    That fine quaver, the Schalscheleth.\n\n    And the Targum Onkelos,\n    Which is written in the idiom,\n    The low-Hebrew sounding idiom\n    That we call the Aram\u00e6an,\n\n    And that to the prophet\u2019s language\n    Has about the same relation\n    As the Swabian to the German,--\n    In this bastard Hebrew likewise\n\n    Was the youth betimes instructed\n    And the knowledge thus acquired\n    Proved extremely useful to him\n    In the study of the Talmud.\n\n    Yes, full early did his father\n    Lead him onward to the Talmud\n    And he then unfolded to him\n    The Halacha, that illustrious\n\n    Fighting school, where the expertest\n    Dialectic athletes both of\n    Babylon and Pumpeditha\n    Carry on their mental combats.\n\n    Here the boy could gain instruction\n    In the arts, too, of polemics;\n    Later, in the book Cosari\n    Was his mastership establish\u2019d.\n\n    Yet the heavens pour down upon us\n    Lights of two distinct descriptions:\n    Glaring daylight of the sun,\n    And the moonlight\u2019s softer lustre.\n\n    Thus two different lights the Talmud\n    Also sheds, and is divided\n    In Halacha and Hagada.--\n    Now the first\u2019s a fighting school,\n\n    But the latter, the Hagada,\n    I should rather call a garden,\n    Yes, a garden, most fantastic,\n    Comparable to that other,\n\n    Which in days of yore was planted\n    In the town of Babylon,--\n    Great Semiramis\u2019s garden,\n    That eighth wonder of the world.\n\n    \u2019Tis said queen Semiramis,\n    Who had, when a child, been brought up\n    By the birds, and had contracted\n    Many a bird\u2019s peculiar custom,\n\n    On the mere flat ground would never\n    Promenade, as human creatures\n    Mostly do, and so she planted\n    In the air a hanging garden.\n\n    High upon colossal pillars\n    Palms and cypresses were standing,\n    Golden oranges, fair flow\u2019r-beds,\n    Marble statues, gushing fountains,--\n\n    Firmly, skilfully united\n    By unnumber\u2019d hanging bridges\n    Which appear\u2019d like climbing plants,\n    And whereon the birds were rocking,--\n\n    Solemn birds, large, many-colour\u2019d,\n    All deep thinkers, never singing,\n    While around them finches flutter\u2019d,\n    Keeping up a merry twitter,--\n\n    All things here were blest, and teeming\n    With a pure balsamic fragrance,\n    Which was free from all offensive\n    Earthly smells and hateful odours.\n\n    The Hagada is a garden\n    That this airy whim resembles,\n    And the youthful Talmud scholar,\n    When his heart was overpower\u2019d\n\n    And was deafen\u2019d by the squabbles\n    Of the\u2019 Halacha, by disputes\n    All about the fatal egg\n    Laid one feast day by a pullet,--\n\n    Or about some other question\n    Of the same importance, straightway\n    Fled the boy to find refreshment\n    In the blossoming Hagada\n\n    Where the charming olden stories,\n    Tales of angels, famous legends,\n    Silent histories of martyrs,\n    Festal songs, and words of wisdom,\n\n    Hyperboles, far-fetch\u2019d it may be,\n    But impress\u2019d with deep conviction,\n    Full of glowing faith,--all glitter\u2019d,\n    Bloom\u2019d and sprung in such abundance.\n\n    And the stripling\u2019s noble bosom\n    Was pervaded by the savage\n    But adventure-breathing sweetness,\n    By the wondrous blissful anguish\n\n    And the fabulous wild terrors\n    Of that blissful secret world,\n    Of that mighty revelation,\n    Known to us as Poesy.\n\n    And the art of Poesy,\n    Radiant knowledge, understanding,\n    Which we call the art poetic,\n    Open\u2019d on the boy\u2019s mind also.\n\n    And Jehuda ben Halevy\n    Was not merely skill\u2019d in reading,\n    But in poetry a master,\n    And himself a first-rate poet.\n\n    Yes, he was a first-rate poet,\n    Star and torch of his own age,\n    Light and beacon of his people,\n    Yes, a very wondrous mighty\n\n    Fiery pillar of all song,\n    That preceded Israel\u2019s mournful\n    Caravan as it was marching\n    Through the desert of sad exile.\n\n    Pure and true alike, and spotless\n    Was his song, as was his spirit;\n    When this spirit was created\n    By its Maker, self-contented,\n\n    He embraced the lovely spirit,\n    And that kiss\u2019s beauteous echo\n    Thrills through all the poet\u2019s numbers,\n    Which are hallow\u2019d by this grace.\n\n    As in life, in numbers also\n    Grace is greatest good of all;\n    He who has it, ne\u2019er transgresses\n    In his prose or in his verses.\n\n    Genius call we such a poet\n    Of the mighty grace of God;\n    He is undisputed monarch\n    Of the boundless realms of fancy.\n\n    He to God alone accounteth,\n    Not to man, and, as in lifetime,\n    So in art the mob have power\n    To destroy, but not to judge us.\n\n\n2.\n\n    \u201cBy the streams of Babylon\n    \u201cSat we down and wept, we hang\u00e8d\n    \u201cOur sad harps upon the willows--\u201d\n    Know\u2019st thou not the olden song?\n\n    Know\u2019st thou not the olden tune,\n    Which begins with elegiac\n    Crying, humming like a kettle\n    That upon the hearth is boiling?\n\n    Long has it been boiling in me,\n    Thousand years. A gloomy anguish\n    And my wounds are lick\u2019d by time,\n    As Job\u2019s boils by dogs were lick\u00e8d.\n\n    Thank thee, dog, for thy saliva,--\n    Though it can but cool and soften--\n    Death alone can ever heal me,\n    But, alas, I am immortal!\n\n    Years come round and years then vanish--\n    Busily the spool is humming\n    As it in the loom is moving,--\n    What it weaves, no weaver knoweth.\n\n    Years come round and years then vanish,\n    Human tears are dripping, running\n    On the earth, and then the earth\n    Sucks them in with eager silence.\n\n    Seething mad! The cover leaps up--\n    \u201cHappy he whose daring hand\n    \u201cTaketh up thy little ones,\n    \u201cDashing them against the stones.\u201d\n\n    God be praised! the seething slowly\n    In the pot evaporates,\n    Then is mute. My spleen is soften\u2019d,\n    My west-eastern darksome spleen.\n\n    And my Pegasus is neighing\n    Once more gaily, and the nightmare\n    Seems to shake with vigour off him,\n    And his wise eyes thus are asking:\n\n    Are we riding back to Spain,\n    To the little Talmudist there,\n    Who was such a first-rate poet,--\n    To Jehuda ben Halevy?\n\n    Yes, he was a first-rate poet,\n    In the realm of dreams sole ruler\n    With the spirit-monarch\u2019s crown,\n    By the grace of God a poet,\n\n    Who in all his sacred metres,\n    In his madrigals, terzinas,\n    Canzonets, and strange ghaselas\n    Pour\u2019d out all the\u2019 abundant fire\n\n    Of his noble god-kiss\u2019d spirit!\n    Of a truth this troubadour\n    Was upon a par with all the\n    Best lute-players of Provence,\n\n    Of Poitou and of Guienne,\n    Roussillon and every other\n    Charming orange-growing region\n    Of gallant old Christendom.\n\n    Charming orange-growing regions\n    Of gallant old Christendom!\n    How they glitter, smell, and tingle\n    In the twilight of remembrance!\n\n    Beauteous world of nightingales!\n    Where we only in the place of\n    The true God, the false God worshipp\u2019d\n    Of the Muses and of love.\n\n    Clergy, bearing wreaths of roses\n    On their bald pates, sang the psalms\n    In the charming langue d\u2019oc;\n    Laity, all gallant knights,\n\n    On their high steeds proudly trotting,\n    Verse and rhyme were ever making\n    To the honour of the ladies\n    Whom their hearts to serve delighted.\n\n    There\u2019s no love without a lady.\n    Therefore to a Minnesinger\n    Was a lady just as needful\n    As to bread-and-butter, butter.\n\n    And the hero, whom we sing of,\n    Our Jehuda ben Halevy,\n    Also had his heart\u2019s fair lady;\n    But she was of special kind.\n\n    She no Laura was, whose eyes,\n    Mortal constellations, kindled\n    On Good Friday the notorious\n    Fire within the famed Cathedral;\n\n    She was not a chatelaine\n    Who, attired in youthful graces,\n    Took the chair at tournaments,\n    And the laurel wreath presented.\n\n    Casuist in the laws of kisses\n    She was not, no doctrinaire,\n    Who within the learned college\n    Of a court of love gave lectures.\n\n    She the Rabbi was in love with\n    Was a poor and mournful loved one,\n    Woeful image of destruction,\n    And her name--Jerusalem!\n\n    In his early days of childhood\n    She his one sole love was always;\n    E\u2019en the word Jerusalem\n    Made his youthful spirit quiver.\n\n    Purple flames were ever standing\n    On the boy\u2019s cheek, and he hearken\u2019d\n    When a pilgrim to Toledo\n    Came from out the far east country,\n\n    And recounted how deserted\n    And uncleanly was the city\n    Where upon the ground the traces\n    Of the prophets\u2019 feet still glisten\u2019d;\n\n    Where the air is still perfumed\n    By the\u2019 undying breath of God--\n    \u201cO the mournful sight!\u201d a pilgrim\n    Once exclaim\u2019d, whose beard was floating\n\n    White as silver, notwithstanding\n    That the hair which form\u2019d its end\n    Once again grew black, appearing\n    As if getting young again.\n\n    And a very wondrous pilgrim\n    Might he be, his eyes were peering\n    As through centuries of sorrow,\n    And he sigh\u2019d: \u201cJerusalem!\n\n    \u201cShe, the crowded holy city,\n    \u201cIs converted to a desert,\n    \u201cWhere wood-devils, werewolves, jackals\n    \u201cTheir accurs\u00e8d home have made.\n\n    \u201cSerpents, birds of night, are dwelling\n    \u201cIn its weather-beaten ruins;\n    \u201cFrom the window\u2019s airy bow\n    \u201cPeeps the fox with much contentment.\n\n    \u201cHere and there a ragged fellow\n    \u201cComes sometimes from out the desert,\n    \u201cAnd his hunch-back\u2019d camel feedeth\n    \u201cIn the long grass growing round it.\n\n    \u201cOn the noble heights of Zion,\n    \u201cWhere stood up the golden fortress\n    \u201cWhose great majesty bore witness\n    \u201cTo the mighty monarch\u2019s glory,--\n\n    \u201cThere, with noisome weeds encumber\u2019d,\n    \u201cNought now lies but gray old ruins,\n    \u201cGazing with such looks of sorrow\n    \u201cOne must fancy they are weeping.\n\n    \u201cAnd \u2019tis said they wept in earnest,\n    \u201cOnce in each year, on the ninth day\n    \u201cOf the month\u2019s that known as Ab--\n    \u201cWith my own eyes, full of weeping,\n\n    \u201cI the clammy drops have witness\u2019d\n    \u201cDown the large stones slowly trickling,\n    \u201cAnd have heard the broken columns\n    \u201cOf the temple sadly moaning.\u201d\n\n    Such-like pious pilgrim-sayings\n    Waken\u2019d in the youthful bosom\n    Of Jehuda ben Halevy\n    Yearnings for Jerusalem.\n\n    Poet\u2019s yearnings! As foreboding,\n    Visionary, sad, as those\n    In the Ch\u00e2teau Blay experienced\n    Whilome by the noble Vidam,\n\n    Messer Geoffroy Rudello,\n    When the knights, returning homeward\n    From the Eastern land, asserted\n    Loudly, as they clash\u2019d their goblets,\n\n    That the paragon of graces,\n    And the flower and pearl of women,\n    Was the beauteous Melisanda,\n    Margravine of Tripoli.\n\n    Each one knows that for this lady\n    Raved the troubadour thenceforward;\n    Her alone he sang, and shortly\n    Ch\u00e2teau Blay no more could hold him;\n\n    And he hasten\u2019d thence. At Cette\n    Took he ship, but on the ocean\n    He fell ill, and sick and dying\n    He arriv\u2019d at Tripoli.\n\n    Here at length, on Melisanda\n    He, too, gazed with eyes all-loving,\n    Which that self-same hour were cover\u2019d\n    By the darksome shades of death.\n\n    Singing his last song of love,\n    He expired before the feet\n    Of his lady Melisanda,\n    Margravine of Tripoli.\n\n    Wonderful was the resemblance\n    In the fate of these two poets!\n    Save that in old age the former\n    His great pilgrimage commenced.\n\n    And Jehuda ben Halevy\n    At his mistress\u2019 feet expired,\n    And his dying head, it rested\n    On Jerusalem\u2019s dear knees.\n\n\n3.\n\n    When the fight at Arabella\n    Had been won, great Alexander\n    Placed Darius\u2019 land and people,\n    Court and harem, horses, women,\n\n    Elephants, and daric coins,\n    Crown and sceptre, golden lumber--\n    Placed them all inside his spacious\n    Macedonian pantaloons.\n\n    In the tent of great Darius,\n    Who himself had fled, because he\n    Fear\u2019d he also might be placed there,\n    The young hero found a casket.\n\n    \u2019Twas a little golden box,\n    Richly ornamented over\n    With incrusted stones and cameos,\n    And with miniature devices.\n\n    Now this casket, in itself\n    Of inestimable value,\n    Served to hold the priceless treasures\n    Of the monarch\u2019s body-jewels.\n\n    All the latter Alexander\n    On his brave commanders lavish\u2019d,\n    Smiling at the thought of men\n    Childlike loving colour\u2019d pebbles.\n\n    One fair valuable gem he\n    To his mother dear presented;\n    \u2019Twas the signet ring of Cyrus,\n    Turn\u2019d into a brooch henceforward.\n\n    To his famous old preceptor\n    Aristotle he presented\n    A fine onyx for his splendid\n    Cabinet of natural history.\n\n    In the casket were some pearls too,\n    Forming quite a wondrous string,\n    Which were once to Queen Atossa\n    Given by the false knave Smerdis;\n\n    But the pearls were all quite real,\n    And the merry victor gave them\n    To a pretty dancer whom he\n    Brought from Corinth, named Miss Thais.\n\n    In her hair the latter wore them,\n    In bacchantic fashion streaming,\n    On that night when she was dancing\n    At Persepolis, and wildly\n\n    In the regal castle hurl\u2019d her\n    Impious torch, till, loudly crackling,\n    Soon the flames obtain\u2019d the mastery,\n    And the fortress laid in ruins.\n\n    On the death of beauteous Thais\n    Who of some bad Babylonian\n    Illness died at Babylon,\n    All her pearls were sold by auction\n\n    At the public auction-rooms there;\n    Purchased by a priest from Memphis,\n    He to Egypt took them with him,\n    Where they on the toilet table\n\n    Of fair Cleopatra glisten\u2019d;\n    She the finest pearl amongst them\n    Crush\u2019d and mix\u2019d with wine and swallow\u2019d,\n    Her friend Antony to banter.\n\n    With the final Ommiad monarch\n    Came the string of pearls to Spain,\n    And they twined around the turban\n    Worn at Cord\u2019va, by the Caliph.\n\n    Abderam the Third he wore them\n    As his breast-knot at the tourney\n    Where he pierced through thirty golden\n    Rings, and fair Zuleima\u2019s bosom.\n\n    When the Moorish race was vanquish\u2019d,\n    Then the Christians gain\u2019d possession\n    Of the pearls, which rank\u2019d thenceforward\n    As crown-jewels of Castile.\n\n    Their most Cath\u2019lic Majesties,\n    Queens of Spain, were wont to wear them\n    On all court and state occasions,\n    At all bullfights, grand processions,\n\n    And at each auto da f\u00e9,\n    When they took their pleasure, sitting\n    At the balcony, in sniffing\n    Up the smell of burnt old Jews.\n\n    Later still, old Mendizabel,\n    Satan\u2019s grandson, pawn\u2019d these jewels,\n    Vainly hoping thus to meet the\n    Deficit in the finances.\n\n    At the Tuileries the jewels\n    Finally appear\u2019d again,\n    Glittering on the neck of Madame\n    Salomon, the Baroness.\n\n    With the fair pearls thus it happened.--\n    Less adventurous the fortune\n    Of the casket, Alexander\n    Keeping it for his own use.\n\n    He the songs enclosed within it\n    Of ambrosia-scented Homer,\n    His great fav\u2019rite, and the casket\n    All night long was wont to stand\n\n    At his bed\u2019s head; when the monarch\n    Slept, the heroes\u2019 airy figures\n    Came from out it, o\u2019er his visions\n    Creeping in fantastic fashion.\n\n    Other times and other birds too--\n    I myself have erst delighted\n    In the stories of the actions\n    Of Pelides, of Odysseus.\n\n    All then seem\u2019d so sunny-golden\n    And so purple to my spirit,\n    Vine-leaves twined around my forehead,\n    And the trumpets flourish\u2019d loudly.\n\n    Hush, no more! All broken lieth\n    Now my haughty victor-chariot,\n    And the panthers, who once drew it,\n    Now are dead, as are the women\n\n    Who, to sound of drum and cymbal,\n    Danced around, and I myself\n    Writhe upon the ground in anguish.\n    Weak and crippled--hush, no more!\n\n    Hush, no more! we now are speaking\n    Of the casket of Darius,\n    And within myself thus thought I:\n    Should I e\u2019er possess the casket,\n\n    And not be obliged to change it\n    Into cash, for want of money,\n    I would then enclose within it\n    All the poems of our Rabbi,--\n\n    All Jehuda ben Halevy\u2019s\n    Festal songs and lamentations,\n    And Ghaselas, the description\n    Of his pilgrimage--the whole I\n\n    Would have written on the cleanest\n    Parchment by the best of scribes,\n    And the manuscript deposit\n    In the little golden casket.\n\n    This should stand upon the table\n    Near my bed, and then, whenever\n    Friends appear\u2019d and were astonish\u2019d\n    At the beauty of the trinket,--\n\n    At the wondrous bas-reliefs,\n    Small in size, and yet so perfect\n    Notwithstanding,--at the jewels\n    Of such size incrusted on it,--\n\n    I should smilingly address them:\n    That is but the vulgar covering\n    That contains a nobler treasure--\n    In this casket there are lying\n\n    Diamonds, whose light doth mirror\n    And reflect the light of heaven,\n    Rubies glowing as the heart\u2019s blood,\n    Turquoises of spotless beauty,\n\n    And fair emeralds of promise,\n    Likewise pearls of greater value\n    Than the pearls to Queen Atossa\n    Given by the false knave Smerdis,\n\n    And that afterwards were worn by\n    All the notabilities\n    Who this mundane earth have dwelt in,\n    Thais first, then Cleopatra,\n\n    Priests of Isis, Moorish princes,\n    And the queens of old Hispania,\n    And at last the worthy Madame\n    Salomon, the Baroness.--\n\n    For those pearls of world-wide glory\n    After all are but the mucus\n    Of a poor unhappy oyster\n    Lying sickly in the ocean;\n\n    But the pearls within this casket\n    Are the offspring of a beauteous\n    Human spirit, far far deeper\n    Than the ocean\u2019s deepest depths,--\n\n    For they are the pearly tears\n    Of Jehuda ben Halevy,\n    That he over the destruction\n    Of Jerusalem let fall.\n\n    Pearly tears, which, join\u2019d together\n    By the golden threads of rhythm,\n    As a song from poesy\u2019s\n    Golden smithy have proceeded.\n\n    And this song of pearly tears\n    Is the famous lamentation\n    That is sung in all the scatter\u2019d\n    And far-distant tents of Jacob\n\n    On the ninth day of the month Ab,\n    That sad anniversary\n    Of Jerusalem\u2019s destruction\n    By the Emperor Vespasian.\n\n    Yes, it is the song of Zion\n    That Jehuda ben Halevy\n    Sang when dying on the holy\n    Ruins of Jerusalem.\n\n    Barefoot and in lowly garments\n    Sat he there upon the fragment\n    Of a pillar that had fallen,\n    Till upon his breast there fell\n\n    Like a gray old wood his hair,\n    Shading over in strange fashion\n    His afflicted pallid features,\n    With his eyes so like a spectre\u2019s.\n\n    In this manner sat he, singing,\n    In appearance like a minstrel\n    From the times of old, like ancient\n    Jeremiah, grave-arisen.\n\n    Soon the birds around the ruins\n    By his numbers\u2019 mournful cadence\n    All were tamed, and e\u2019en the vulture\n    Drew near list\u2019ning, almost pitying,--\n\n    But an impious Saracen\n    Came one day in that direction,\n    On his charger in his stirrups\n    Balancing, his bright lance wielding.\n\n    And the breast of our poor singer\n    With this deadly spear transfix\u2019d he,\n    And then gallop\u2019d off instanter\n    Wing\u2019d as though a shadowy figure.\n\n    Calmly flow\u2019d the Rabbi\u2019s life-blood,\n    Calmly to its termination\n    Sang he his sweet song,--his dying\n    Sigh was still--Jerusalem!\n\n    It is said in olden legend\n    That the Saracen was really\n    Not a wicked cruel mortal,\n    But an angel in disguise,\n\n    Sent from the bright realms of heaven\n    To remove God\u2019s favourite\n    From the earth, and to advance him\n    Painlessly to those blest regions.\n\n    There, \u2019tis said, there waited for him\n    A reception highly flatt\u2019ring\n    In its nature to the poet,\n    Quite a heavenly surprise.\n\n    Solemnly with strains of music\n    Came the\u2019 angelic choir to meet him,\n    And instead of hymns, he heard them\n    Singing his own lovely verses,\n\n    Synagoguish Wedding-Carmen,\n    Hymeneal Sabbath numbers,\n    With their well-known and exulting\n    Melodies--what notes enthralling!\n\n    While some angels play\u2019d the hautboy,\n    Others play\u2019d upon the fiddle;\n    Others handled the bass-viol,\n    Others beat the drum and cymbal.\n\n    Sweetly all the music sounded.\n    Sweetly through the far-extending\n    Vaults of heaven these strains re-echoed\n    Lecho Daudi Likras Kalle!\n\n\n4.\n\n    My good wife is not contented\n    With the chapter just concluded,\n    And especially the portion\n    Speaking of Darius\u2019 casket.\n\n    Almost bitterly observes she,\n    That a husband with pretensions\n    To religion, into money\n    Straightway would convert the casket,\n\n    That he with it might be able\n    For his poor and lawful spouse\n    That nice Cashmere shawl to purchase\n    That she stands so much in need of.\n\n    That Jehuda ben Halevy\n    Would, she fancies, with sufficient\n    Honour be preserved, if guarded\n    In a pretty box of pasteboard,\n\n    Deck\u2019d with Chinese elegant\n    Arabesques, like those enchanting\n    Sweetmeat-boxes of Marquis\n    In the Passage Panorama.\n\n    \u201cVery strange it is,\u201d--she added,--\n    \u201cThat I never heard the name of\n    \u201cThis remarkable old poet,\n    \u201cThis Jehuda ben Halevy.\u201d\n\n    Darling little wife, I answer\u2019d,\n    Your delightful ignorance\n    But too well the gaps discloses\n    In the education given\n\n    In the boarding schools of Paris,\n    Where the girls, the future mothers\n    Of a proud and freeborn nation,\n    Learn the elements of knowledge.\n\n    All about the dry old mummies,\n    And embalm\u2019d Egyptian Pharaohs\n    Merovingian shadowy monarchs,\n    With perukes devoid of powder,\n\n    And the pig-tail\u2019d kings of China,\n    Lords of porcelain and pagodas,--\n    This they know by heart and fully,\n    Clever girls,--but, O, good heavens\n\n    If you ask for any great names\n    From the glorious golden ages\n    Of Arabian-ancient-Spanish\n    Jewish schools of poetry,--\n\n    If you ask for those three worthies,\n    For Jehuda ben Halevy,\n    For great Solomon Gabirol,\n    Or for Moses Iben Esra,\n\n    If you ask for these or suchlike,\n    Then the children stare upon us\n    With a look of stupid wonder,\n    And in fact seem quite dumb-founded.\n\n    Let me then advise you, dearest,\n    These neglected points to study,\n    And to take to learning Hebrew\n    Leaving theatres and concerts.\n\n    When a few years to these studies\n    Have been given, you\u2019ll be able\n    In the\u2019 original to read them,\n    Iben Esra and Gabirol,\n\n    And Halevy in addition,\n    That triumvirate poetic,\n    Who evoked the sweetest music\n    From the instrument of David.\n\n    Alcharisi, who, I\u2019ll wager,\n    Is to you unknown, although he\n    A Voltairian was, six hundred\n    Years before Voltaire\u2019s time, spoke thus:\n\n    \u201cIn his thoughts excels Gabirol,\n    \u201cAnd the thinker most he pleases;\n    \u201cIben Esra shines in art, and\n    \u201cIs the fav\u2019rite of the artist.\n\n    \u201cBut Jehuda ben Halevy\n    \u201cIs in both a perfect master,\n    \u201cAnd at once a famous poet\n    \u201cAnd a universal fav\u2019rite.\u201d\n\n    Iben Esra was a friend,\n    And I rather think, a cousin\n    Of Jehuda ben Halevy,\n    Who in his famed book of travels\n\n    Bitterly complains how vainly\n    He had sought through all Granada\n    For his friend, and only found there\n    His friend\u2019s brother, the physician,\n\n    Rabbi Meyer, poet likewise,\n    And the father of the beauty\n    Who in Iben Esra\u2019s bosom\n    Kindled such a hopeless passion.\n\n    That he might forget his niece, he\n    Took in hand his pilgrim\u2019s staff,\n    Like so many of his colleagues,\n    Living restlessly and homeless.\n\n    Tow\u2019rd Jerusalem he wander\u2019d,\n    When some Tartars fell upon him,\n    Fasten\u2019d him upon a steed\u2019s back,\n    And to their wild deserts took him.\n\n    Duties there devolved upon him\n    Quite unworthy of a Rabbi,\n    Still less fitted for a poet--\n    He was made to milk the cows.\n\n    Once, as he beneath the belly\n    Of a cow was sitting squatting,\n    Fing\u2019ring hastily her udder,\n    While the milk the tub was filling,--\n\n    A position quite unworthy\n    Of a Rabbi, of a poet,--\n    Melancholy came across him,\n    And to sing a song began he.\n\n    And he sang so well and sweetly,\n    That the Khan, the horde\u2019s old chieftain,\n    Who was passing by, was melted,\n    And he gave the slave his freedom.\n\n    And he likewise gave him presents,\n    Gave a fox-skin, and a lengthy\n    Saracenic mandoline,\n    And some money for his journey.\n\n    Poets\u2019 fate! an evil star \u2019tis,\n    Which the offspring of Apollo\n    Worried unto death, and even\n    Did not spare their noble father,\n\n    When he, after Daphne lurking,\n    In the fair nymph\u2019s snowy body\u2019s\n    Stead, embraced the laurel only,--\n    He, the great divine Schlemihl!\n\n    Yes, the glorious Delphic god is\n    A Schlemihl, and e\u2019en the laurel\n    That so proudly crowns his forehead\n    Is a sign of his Schlemihldom.\n\n    What the word Schlemihl betokens\n    Well we know. Long since Chamisso\n    Rights of German citizenship\n    Gain\u2019d it (of the word I\u2019m speaking).\n\n    But its origin has ever,\n    Like the holy Nile\u2019s far sources,\n    Been unknown. Upon this subject\n    Many a night have I been poring.\n\n    Many a year ago I travell\u2019d\n    To Berlin, to see Chamisso\n    On this point, and from the dean sought\n    Information of Schlemihl.\n\n    But he could not satisfy me,\n    And referr\u2019d me on to Hitzig,\n    Who had made the first suggestion\n    Of the family name of Peter\n\n    Shadowless. I straightway hired\n    The first cab, and quickly hasten\u2019d\n    To the magistrate Herr Hitzig,\n    Who was formerly call\u2019d Itzig.\n\n    When he still was known as Itzig,\n    In a vision saw he written\n    His own name high in the heavens,\n    And in front the letter H.\n\n    \u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this H?\u201d\n    Ask\u2019d he of himself. \u201cHerr Itzig\n    \u201cOr the Holy Itzig? Holy\n    \u201cIs a pretty title. Not, though,\n\n    \u201cSuited for Berlin.\u201d At length he,\n    Tired of thinking, took the name of\n    Hitzig, and his best friends only\n    Knew that Hitzig stood for Holy.\n\n    \u201cHoly Hitzig!\u201d said I therefore\n    When I saw him, \u201chave the goodness\n    \u201cTo explain the derivation\n    \u201cOf the word Schlemihl, I pray you.\u201d\n\n    Many circumbendibuses\n    Took the holy one--he could not\n    Recollect,--and made excuses\n    In succession like a Christian,\n\n    Till at length I burst the buttons\n    In the breeches of my patience,\n    And began to swear so fiercely,\n    In such very impious fashion,\n\n    That the worthy pietist,\n    Pale as death, with trembling knees,\n    Forthwith gratified my wishes,\n    And the following story told me:\n\n    \u201cIn the Bible it is written\n    \u201cHow, while wandering in the desert,\n    \u201cIsrael oft committed whoredom\n    \u201cWith the daughters fair of Canaan.\n\n    \u201cThen it came to pass that Phinehas\n    \u201cChanced to see the noble Zimri\n    \u201cThus engaged in an intrigue\n    \u201cWith a Canaanitish woman.\n\n    \u201cStraightway in his fury seized he\n    \u201cOn his spear, and put to death\n    \u201cZimri on the very spot.--Thus\n    \u201cIn the Bible \u2019tis recounted.\n\n    \u201cBut, according to an oral\n    \u201cOld tradition \u2019mongst the people,\n    \u201c\u2019Twas not Zimri that was really\n    \u201cStricken by the spear of Phinehas;\n\n    \u201cBut the latter, blind with fury,\n    \u201cIn the sinner\u2019s place, by ill-luck\n    \u201cChanced to kill a guiltless person,\n    \u201cNamed Schlemihl ben Zuri Schadday.\u201d--\n\n    He, then, this Schlemihl the First,\n    Was the ancestor of all the\n    Race Schlemihlian. We\u2019re descended\n    From Schlemihl ben Zuri Schadday.\n\n    Certainly no wondrous actions\n    Are preserved of his; we only\n    Know his name, and in addition\n    Know that he was a Schlemihl.\n\n    But a pedigree is valued\n    Not according to its fruits, but\n    Its antiquity alone--\n    Ours three thousand years can reckon.\n\n    Years come round, and years then vanish--\n    Full three thousand years have fleeted\n    Since the death of our forefather\n    This Schlemihl ben Zuri Schadday.\n\n    Phinehas, too, has long been dead,\n    But his spear is in existence,\n    And incessantly we hear it\n    Whizzing through the air above us.\n\n    And the noblest hearts it pierces--\n    Both Jehuda ben Halevy,\n    Also Moses Iben Esra,\n    And it likewise struck Gabirol,\n\n    Yes, Gabirol, that truehearted\n    God-devoted Minnesinger,\n    That sweet nightingale, who sang to\n    God instead of to a rose,--\n\n    That sweet nightingale who caroll\u2019d\n    Tenderly his loving numbers\n    In the darkness of the Gothic\n    Medi\u00e6val night of earth!\n\n    Undismay\u2019d and caring nothing\n    For grimaces or for spirits,\n    Or the chaos of delirium\n    And of death those ages haunting,\n\n    Our sweet nightingale thought only\n    Of the Godlike One he loved so,\n    Unto Whom he sobb\u2019d his love,\n    Whom his hymns were glorifying.\n\n    Thirty springs Gabirol witness\u2019d\n    On this earth, but loud-tongued Fama\n    Trumpeted abroad the glory\n    Of his name through every country.\n\n    Now at Cordova, his home, he\n    Had a Moor as nextdoor neighbour,\n    Who wrote verses, like the other,\n    And the poet\u2019s glory envied.\n\n    When he heard the poet singing,\n    Then the Moor\u2019s bile straight flow\u2019d over,\n    And the sweetness of the songs was\n    Bitter wormwood to this base one.\n\n    He enticed his hated rival\n    To his house one night, and slew him\n    There, and then the body buried\n    In the garden in its rear.\n\n    But behold! from out the spot\n    Where the body had been hidden,\n    Presently there grew a fig-tree\n    Of the most enchanting beauty.\n\n    All its fruit was long in figure,\n    And of strange and spicy sweetness;\n    He who tasted it, sank into\n    Quite a dreamy state of rapture.\n\n    \u2019Mongst the people on the subject\n    Much was said aloud or whisper\u2019d,\n    Till at length the rumour came to\n    The illustrious Caliph\u2019s ears.\n\n    He with his own tongue first tasted\n    This strange fig-phenomenon,\n    And then form\u2019d a strict commission\n    Of inquiry on the matter.\n\n    Summarily they proceeded;\n    On the owner of the tree\u2019s soles\n    Sixty strokes of the bamboo they\n    Gave, and then his crime confess\u2019d he.\n\n    Thereupon they tore the tree up\n    By its roots from out the ground,\n    And the body of the murder\u2019d\n    Man Gabirol was discover\u2019d.\n\n    He was buried with due honour,\n    And lamented by his brethren;\n    And the selfsame day they also\n    Hang\u2019d the Moor at Cordova.", "DISPUTATION": "    In the Aula at

known as Blanche de Bourbon,\n      Donna Blanca now they call her.\n\n    And the monarch\u2019s name is Pedro,\n      With the nickname of The Cruel;\n    But to-day, in gentle mood, he\n      Looks as if he ne\u2019er could do ill.\n\n    With the nobles of his court he\n      Enters into conversation,\n    And both Jew and Moor addresses\n      With a courteous salutation.\n\n    For these sons

his voice, now harsh, now growling,\n      Blusters in a curious fashion.\n\n    Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\n      In one sentence he comprises,\n    And the seed accurst of Jacob\n      In the Rabbi exorcises.\n\n    For in suchlike controversies\n      Little devils oft are hidden\n    In the Jews, and give them sharpness,\n      Wit, and arguments when bidden.\n\n    Having thus expell\u2019d the devil\n      By his mighty exorcism,\n    Comes the monk, dogmatically,\n      Quoting from the catechism.\n\n    He recounts how in the Godhead\n      Persons three are

prison\n      And the chains of human reason.\n\n    He recounts how God was born at\n      Bethlehem, of a tenderhearted\n    Virgin, whose divine unsullied\n      Innocency ne\u2019er departed.\n\n    How they laid the Lord Almighty\n      In a lowly stable manger,\n    Where the calf and heifer meekly\n      Stood around the newborn stranger.\n\n    He recounts, too, how the Lord\n      From

condemnation,\n    Urged on by the Jews and cruel\n      Pharisees\u2019 confederation.\n\n    He recounts, too, how the Lord,\n      Bursting from the tomb\u2019s dark prison\n    On the third day, into heaven\n      Had in glorious triumph risen;\n\n    How, when \u2019tis the proper time, he\n      Would return to earth in splendour,\n    At Jehoshaphat, to judge there\n      Every quick and

out his head; an ass stood by,\n      Demurely chewing a thistle.\n\n    With wondering gaze the horse long stared\n      At the train; then strangely quivering\n    In every limb, he sigh\u2019d, and said:\n      \u201cThe sight has set me a-shivering!\n\n    \u201cI\u2019m sure that if I by nature had been\n      \u201cA chesnut, or black, or bay horse,\n    \u201cMy skin with the fright its

It was a summer\u2019s night,\n      And in the moonlight, pale and weatherbeaten,\n    Lay buildings, relics of past ages bright,--\n      The style, renaissant, of these wrecks time-eaten.\n\n    And here and there, with stately Doric head,\n      Rose single columns from the mass there lying,\n    And on the firmament high o\u2019er them spread\n      Gazed they, as if its thunderbolts defying.\n\n    In broken fragments lay there on the ground,\n      Mingled with many a portal, many a gable,\n    Sculptures where man, beast, centaur, sphinx were found,\n      Chimera, satyr,--creatures of old fable.\n\n    The contrasts there presented were grotesque,\n      The emblems of Jud\u00e6a\u2019s God combining\n    With Grecian grace, in fashion arabesque\n      The ivy round them both, its tendrils twining.\n\n    A fair sarcophagus of marble white\n      Amid the ruins stood, unmutilated;\n    And in the coffin lay a corpse in sight,\n      Of features mild, with sadness penetrated.\n\n    The power supporting it appear\u2019d supplied\n      By Caryatides, with necks extended;\n    And many a bas-relief on either side\n      Was seen, of chisell\u2019d figures strangely blended.\n\n    The glories of Olympus there saw I,\n      With all its heathen deities misguided;\n    Adam and Eve were there, decorously\n      With figleaf aprons round their loins provided.\n\n    Troy\u2019s taking and Troy\u2019s burning here were seen,\n      Hector and Helen, Paris (that wild gay man);\n    Moses and Aaron also stood between,\n      With Esther, Judith, Holofernes, Haman.\n\n    God Amor also had his place hard by,\n      Ph\u0153bus, Apollo, Vulcan, Madam Venus,\n    Pluto, Proserpina, and Mercury,\n      God Bacchus, and Priapus, and Silenus.\n\n    Likewise was Balaam\u2019s ass omitted not,--\n      (The ass for speaking seem\u2019d, in fact, created),\n    And Abraham\u2019s temptation too, and Lot,\n      Who by his daughters was intoxicated.\n\n    Herodias\u2019 daughter\u2019s dance was shown as well,\n      The Baptist\u2019s head was in the charger given;\n    The monster Satan too was there, and hell,\n      And Peter, with the heavy keys of heaven.\n\n    And next in order saw I sculptured there\n      The loves of Jove, with his vile actions blending;\n    How as a swan he ravish\u2019d Leda fair,\n      And Dana\u00eb, in golden shower descending.\n\n    The wild hunt of Diana was display\u2019d,\n      With her fleet dogs, and nymphs attired so trimly;\n    And Hercules, in woman\u2019s clothes array\u2019d,\n      Distaff on arm, the spindle whirling nimbly.\n\n    And next was Sinai\u2019s mountain to be view\u2019d,\n      And Israel near it, with his oxen lowing;\n    The Lord a child within the temple stood,\n      Disputing with the doctors proud and knowing.\n\n    But, strange to tell, when I had dreamily\n      These forms a while observed, in thought suspended,\n    I suddenly conceived myself to be\n      The corpse, in that fair marble tomb extended.\n\n    And at the head of this my grave there stood\n      A flower full fair, of strange configuration;\n    Its leaves were yellow-tinged and violet-hued,\n      The flower possess\u2019d a wondrous fascination.\n\n    \u2019Tis by the name of passion-flower well known,\n      On Golgotha, they say, \u2019twas first created\n    The day they crucified God\u2019s only Son,\n      And the Redeemer\u2019s body lacerated.\n\n    Bloodwitness doth this flower now bear, they say;\n      Each instrument of torture then invented\n    And used at His sad martyrdom that day,\n      Is in its calyx duly represented.\n\n    Yes! every passion-attribute adorns\n      The flower, each emblem of their cruel malice,--\n    For instance, scourge and rope and crown of thorns,\n      The hammer and the nails, the cross, the chalice.\n\n    Such was the flower which at my grave did stand,\n      And o\u2019er my body bending with compassion,\n    As with a woman\u2019s sorrow, kiss\u2019d my hand,\n      My eyes, and forehead, in sad silent fashion.\n\n    But O, my dream\u2019s strange magic! Wondrously\n      The passion-flower, the yellow-hued and rare one,\n    Changed to a woman\u2019s likeness,--ah! and she,\n      She was my loved one, she was mine own fair one!\n\n    Thou wert the flower, yes, thou, my darling child!\n      At once I knew thee by thy kisses yearning;\n    No lips of flowers so tender are and mild,\n      No tears of flowers so fiery are and burning.\n\n    Although mine eyes were closed, my spirit gazed\n      With steadiness upon thy face entrancing;\n    Thou look\u2019dst at me with raptured look amazed,\n      Strangely illumined in the moonlight glancing.\n\n    No words we spake, and yet my heart could see\n      The thoughts that in thy mind in silence hover\u2019d;\n    A word when spoken has no modesty,\n      By silence is love\u2019s modest blossoms cover\u2019d.\n\n    Voiceless our converse! Wondrous doth it seem\n      How in our silent, tender conversation\n    The time pass\u2019d in that summer night\u2019s fair dream,\n      When joy commingled was with consternation.\n\n    That which we spoke of then, ne\u2019er seek to learn,\n      The glow-worm ask, why in the grass it gloweth,\n    The torrent, why it roareth in the burn,\n      The west wind, why it waileth as it bloweth.\n\n    Ask the carbuncle why it gleams so bright,\n      The rose and violet, why so sweetly scented;\n    But ask not what, beneath the moon\u2019s soft light,\n      The martyr-flower talk\u2019d with her love lamented!\n\n    I cannot tell how long it was that I\n      Enjoy\u2019d, as in the marble tomb I slumber\u2019d,\n    That beauteous, happy dream. It fleeted by,\n      Too soon the moments of my rest were number\u2019d.\n\n    Death with thy gravelike silence! Thou alone\n      Canst give us pleasure in a lasting fashion;\n    Vain barbarous life, for joy is ever known\n      To give us restless bliss, convulsive passion.\n\n    Alas, alas! my happiness soon fled,\n      For suddenly arose a noise exciting,\n    It was a savage conflict, fierce and dread--\n      Ah, my poor flower was scared by all this fighting!\n\n    Yes! there arose outside, with hideous yell,\n      A quarrelling, a yelping, and a scolding;\n    Methought that many a voice I knew full well,--\n      It was the bas-reliefs my tomb enfolding!\n\n    Is the stone haunted by those visions wan?\n      And are those marble phantoms all disputing?\n    The fearful clamour of the wood-god Pan,\n      Moses\u2019s fierce anathemas confuting.\n\n    Alas! this contest ne\u2019er will ended be,\n      The True and Beautiful will wrangle ever!\n    Greeks and Barbarians in wild rivalry\n      The ranks of man are always doom\u2019d to sever.\n\n    They cursed and raved. No end would there have been\n      To this long squabble, and their passion towering,\n    Had Balaam\u2019s ass not come upon the scene,\n      The voices of the gods and saints o\u2019erpowering.\n\n    The stupid beast, with his disgusting brag,\n      That sobbing sound of sheer abomination,\n    Made me cry out in terrible dismay,\n      And I awoke at last in desperation.", "metadata": "heine|Heinrich Heine|1797|1856|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Heine"}
