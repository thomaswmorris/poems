He goes\nHeavily, blindly on. And, while he blunders,\n\"Could anything be worse than this!\"--he wonders,\nRemembering how he saw those Germans run,\nScreaming for mercy among the stumps of trees:\nGreen-faced, they dodged and darted: there was one\nLivid with terror, clutching at his knees...\nOur chaps were sticking 'em like pigs... \"O hell!\"\nHe thought--\"there's things in war one dare not tell\nPoor father sitting safe at home, who reads\nOf dying heroes and their deathless deeds.\"", "DEAD MUSICIANS": "I\n\nFrom you, Beethoven, Bach, Mozart,\n  The substance of my dreams took fire.\nYou built cathedrals in my heart,\n  And lit my pinnacled desire.\nYou were the ardour and the bright\n  Procession of my thoughts toward prayer.\nYou were the wrath of storm, the light\n  On distant citadels aflare.\n\nII\n\nGreat names, I cannot find you now\n  In these loud years of youth that strives\nThrough doom toward peace: upon my brow\n  I wear a wreath of banished lives.\nYou have no part with lads who fought\n  And laughed and suffered at my side.\nYour fugues and symphonies have brought\n  No memory of my friends who died.\n\nIII\n\nFor when my brain is on their track,\nIn slangy speech I call them back.\nWith fox-trot tunes their ghosts I charm.\n    _\"Another little drink won't do us any harm.\"\n    I think of rag-time; a bit of rag-time;\n    And see their faces crowding round\n    To the sound of the syncopated beat.\n    They've got such jolly things to tell,\n    Home from hell with a Blighty wound so neat..._\n    *       *       *       *       *\nAnd so the song breaks off; and I'm alone.\nThey're dead...
