{"MUSSEL HUNTER AT ROCK HARBOR": "I came before the water--\nColorists came to get the\nGood of the Cape light that scours\nSand grit to sided crystal\nAnd buffs and sleeks the blunt hulls\nOf the three fishing smacks beached\nOn the bank of the river's\n\nBacktracking tail. I'd come for\nFree fish-bait: the blue mussels\nClumped like bulbs at the grassroot\nMargin of the tidal pools.\nDawn tide stood dead low. I smelt\nMud stench, shell guts, gulls' leavings;\nHeard a queer crusty scrabble\n\nCease, and I neared the silenced\nEdge of a cratered pool-bed.\nThe mussels hung dull blue and\nConspicuous, yet it seemed\nA sly world's hinges had swung\nShut against me. All held still.\nThough I counted scant seconds,\n\nEnough ages lapsed to win\nConfidence of safe-conduct\nIn the wary other world\nEyeing me. Grass put forth claws,\nSmall mud knobs, nudged from under,\nDisplaced their domes as tiny\nKnights might doff their casques. The crabs\n\nInched from their pygmy burrows\nAnd from the trench-dug mud, all Camouflaged in mottled mail\nOf browns and greens. Each wore one\nClaw swollen to a shield large\nAs itself--no fiddler's arm\nGrown Gargantuan by trade,\n\nBut grown grimly, and grimly\nBorne, for a use beyond my\nGuessing of it. Sibilant\nMass-motived hordes, they sidled\nOut in a converging stream\nToward the pool-mouth, perhaps to\nMeet the thin and sluggish thread\n\nOf sea retracing its tide--\nWay up the river-basin.\nOr to avoid me. They moved\nObliquely with a dry-wet\nSound, with a glittery wisp\nAnd trickle. Could they feel mud\nPleasurable under claws\n\nAs I could between bare toes?\nThat question ended it--I\nStood shut out, for once, for all,\nPuzzling the passage of their\nAbsolutely alien\nOrder as I might puzzle\nAt the clear tail of Halley's\n\nComet coolly giving my\nOrbit the go-by, made known\nBy a family name it\nKnew nothing of. So the crabs\nWent about their business, which\nWasn't fiddling, and I filled\nA big handkerchief with blue\n\nMussels. From what the crabs saw,\nIf they could see, I was one\nTwo-legged mussel-picker.\nHigh on the airy thatching\nOf the dense grasses I found\nThe husk of a fiddler-crab,\nIntact, strangely strayed above\n\nHis world of mud--green color\nAnd innards bleached out blown off\nSomewhere by much sun and wind;\nThere was no telling if he'd\nDied recluse of suicide\nOr headstrong Columbus crab.\nThe crab-face, etched and set there,\n\nGrimaced as skulls grimace: it\nHad an Oriental look,\nA samurai death mask done\nOn a tiger tooth, less for\nArt's sake than God's. Far from sea--\nWhere red-freckled crab-backs, claws\nAnd whole crabs, dead, their soggy\n\nBellies pallid and upturned,\nPerform their shambling waltzes\nOn the waves' dissolving turn\nAnd return, losing themselves\nBit by bit to their friendly\nElement--this relic saved\nFace, to face the bald-faced sun.", "WINTER TREES": "The wet dawn inks are doing their blue dissolve.\nOn their blotter of fog the trees\nSeem a botanical drawing.\nMemories growing, ring on ring,\nA series of weddings.\n\nKnowing neither abortions nor bitchery,\nTruer than women,\nThey seed so effortlessly!\nTasting the winds, that are footless,\nWaist-deep in history.\n\nFull of wings, otherworldliness.\nIn this, they are Ledas.\nO mother of leaves and sweetness\nWho are these pietas?\nThe shadows of ringdoves chanting, but chasing nothing.", "MONOLOGUE AT 3 AM": "Better that every fiber crack\nand fury make head,\nblood drenching vivid\ncouch, carpet, floor\nand the snake-figured almanac\nvouching you are\na million green counties from here,\n\nthan to sit mute, twitching so\nunder prickling stars,\nwith stare, with curse\nblackening the time\ngoodbyes were said, trains let go,\nand I, great magnanimous fool, thus wrenched from\nmy one kingdom.", "THE EVERLASTING MONDAY": "Thou shalt have an everlasting\nMonday and stand in the moon.\n\nThe moon's man stands in his shell,\nBent under a bundle\nOf sticks. The light falls chalk and cold\nUpon our bedspread.\nHis teeth are chattering among the leprous\nPeaks and craters of those extinct volcanoes.\n\nHe also against black frost\nWould pick sticks, would not rest\nUntil his own lit room outshone\nSunday's ghost of sun;\nNow works his hell of Mondays in the moon's ball,\nFireless, seven chill seas chained to his ankle.", "WAKING IN WINTER": "I can taste the tin of the sky -- the real tin thing.\nWinter dawn is the color of metal,\nThe trees stiffen into place like burnt nerves.\nAll night I have dreamed of destruction, annihilations --\nAn assembly-line of cut throats, and you and I\nInching off in the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green\nPoison of stilled lawns, the little clapboard gravestones,\nNoiseless, on rubber wheels, on the way to the sea resort.\n\nHow the balconies echoed! How the sun lit up\nThe skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the view!\nSpace! Space! The bed linen was giving out entirely.\nCot legs melted in terrible attitudes, and the nurses --\nEach nurse patched her soul to a wound and disappeared.\nThe deathly guests had not been satisfied\nWith the rooms, or the smiles, or the beautiful rubber plants,\nOr the sea, Hushing their peeled sense like Old Mother Morphia.", "CROSSING THE WATER": "Black lake, black boat, two black, cut-paper people.\nWhere do the black trees go that drink here?\nTheir shadows must cover Canada.\n\nA little light is filtering from the water flowers.\nTheir leaves do not wish us to hurry:\nThey are round and flat and full of dark advice.\n\nCold worlds shake from the oar.\nThe spirit of blackness is in us, it is in the fishes.\nA snag is lifting a valedictory, pale hand;\n\nStars open among the lilies.\nAre you not blinded by such expressionless sirens?\nThis is the silence of astounded souls.", "POPPIES IN OCTOBER": "Even the sun-clouds this morning cannot manage such skirts.\nNor the woman in the ambulance\nWhose red heart blooms through her coat so astoundingly \u2013\n\nA gift, a love gift\nUtterly unasked for\nBy a sky\n\nPalely and flamily\nIgniting its carbon monoxides, by eyes\nDulled to a halt under bowlers.\n\nOh my God, what am I\nThat these late mouths should cry open\nIn a forest of frosts, in a dawn of cornflowers.", "THE COLOSSUS": "I shall never get you put together entirely,\nPieced, glued, and properly jointed.\nMule-bray, pig-grunt and bawdy cackles\nProceed from your great lips.\nIt\u2019s worse than a barnyard.\n \nPerhaps you consider yourself an oracle,\nMouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other.\nThirty years now I have labored\nTo dredge the silt from your throat.\nI am none the wiser.\n \nScaling little ladders with glue pots and pails of lysol\nI crawl like an ant in mourning\nOver the weedy acres of your brow\nTo mend the immense skull plates and clear\nThe bald, white tumuli of your eyes.\n \nA blue sky out of the Oresteia\nArches above us.
