{"THE BIG BABOON": "The Big Baboon is found upon\nThe plains of Cariboo:\nHe goes about with nothing on\n(A shocking thing to do).\n\nBut if he dressed up respectably\nAnd let his whiskers grow,\nHow like this Big Baboon would be\nTo Mister So-and-so!", "THE STATUE": "When we are dead, some Hunting-boy will pass\nAnd find a stone half-hidden in tall grass\nAnd grey with age: but having seen that stone\n(Which was your image), ride more slowly on.", "THE BIRDS": "When Jesus Christ was four years old\nThe angels brought Him toys of gold,\nWhich no man ever had bought or sold.\n\nAnd yet with these He would not play.\nHe made Him small fowl out of clay,\nAnd blessed them till they flew away:\nTu creasti Domine\n\nJesus Christ, Thou child so wise,\nBless mine hands and fill mine eyes,\nAnd bring my soul to Paradise.", "REBECCA, WHO SLAMMED DOORS FOR FUN AND PERISHED MISERABLY": "A trick that everyone abhors\nIn little girls is slamming doors.\nA wealthy banker's little daughter\nWho lived in Palace Green, Bayswater\n(By name Rebecca Offendort),\nWas given to this furious sport.\n\nShe would deliberately go\nAnd slam the door like billy-o!\nTo make her uncle Jacob start.\nShe was not really bad at heart,\nBut only rather rude and wild;\nShe was an aggravating child...\n\nIt happened that a marble bust\nOf Abraham was standing just\nAbove the door this little lamb\nHad carefully prepared to slam,\nAnd down it came! It knocked her flat!\nIt laid her out! She looked like that.\n\nHer funeral sermon (which was long\nAnd followed by a sacred song)\nMentioned her virtues, it is true,\nBut dwelt upon her vices too,\nAnd showed the deadful end of one\nWho goes and slams the door for fun.\n\nThe children who were brought to hear\nThe awful tale from far and near\nWere much impressed, and inly swore\nThey never more would slam the door,\n--As often they had done before.", "BECAUSE MY FALTERING FEET": "Because my faltering feet may fail to dare\nThe first descendant of the steps of Hell\nGive me the Word in time that triumphs there.\nI too must pass into the misty hollow\nWhere all our living laughter stops: and hark!\nThe tiny stuffless voices of the dark\nHave called me, called me, till I needs must follow:\nGive me the Word and I'll attempt it well.\n\nSay it's the little winking of an eye\nWhich in that issue is uncurtained quite;\nA little sleep that helpsa moment by\nBetween the thin dawn and the large daylight.\nAh! tell me more than yet was hoped of men;\nSwear that's true now, and I'll believe it then.", "HERETICS ALL": "Heretics all, whoever you may be,\nIn Tarbes or Nimes, or over the sea,\nYou never shall have good words from me.\nCaritas non conturbat me.\n\nBut Catholic men that live upon wine\nAre deep in the water, and frank, and fine;\nWherever I travel I find it so,\nBenedicamus Domino.\n\nOn childing women that are forelorn,\nAnd men that sweat in nothing but scorn:\nThat is on all that ever were born,\nMiserere Domine.\n\nTo my poor self on my deathbed,\nAnd all my dear companions dead,\nBecause of the love that I bore them,\nDona Eis Requiem.", "OCTOBER": "Look, how those steep woods on the mountain's face\nBurn, burn against the sunset; now the cold\nInvades our very noon: the year's grown old,\nMornings are dark, and evenings come apace.\nThe vines below have lost their purple grace,\nAnd in Forreze the white wrack backward rolled,\nHangs to the hills tempestuous, fold on fold,\nAnd moaning gusts make desolate all the place.\n\nMine host the month, at thy good hostelry,\nTired limbs I'll stretch and steaming beast I'll tether;\nPile on great logs with Gascon hand and free,\nAnd pour the Gascon stuff that laughs at weather;\nSwell your tough lungs, north wind, no whit care we,\nSinging old songs and drinking wine together.", "THE DEATH AND LAST CONFESSION OF WANDERING PETER": "When Peter Wanderwide was young\nHe wandered everywhere he would:\nAll that he approved was sung,\nAnd most of what he saw was good.\n\nWhen Peter Wanderwide was thrown\nBy Death himself beyond Auxerre,\nHe chanted in heroic tone\nTo priests and people gathered there:\n\n\"If all that I have loved and seen\nBe with me on the Judgment Day,\nI shall be saved the crowd between\nFrom Satan and his foul array.\n\n\"Almighty God will surely cry,\n'St. Michael!

Not so Sal! \nShe was a most uncultured girl \nWho didn't care a pinch of snuff \nFor any literary stuff \nAnd gave the classics all a miss. \nObserve the consequence of this! \nAs she was walking home one day, \nUpon the fields across her way \nA gate, securely padlocked, stood, \nAnd by its side a piece of wood \nOn which was painted plain and full, \nBEWARE THE VERY FURIOUS BULL \nAlas! The young illiterate \nWent blindly forward to her fate, \nAnd ignorantly climbed the gate! \nNow happily the Bull that day \nWas rather in the mood for play \nThan goring people through and through \nAs Bulls so very often do; \nHe tossed her lightly with his horns \nInto a prickly hedge of thorns, \nAnd stood by laughing while she strode \nAnd pushed and struggled to the road. \nThe lesson was not lost upon \nThe child, who since has always gone \nA long way round to keep away \nFrom signs, whatever they may say, \nAnd leaves a padlocked gate alone. \nMoreover she has wisely grown \nConfirmed in her instinctive guess \nThat literature breeds distress.
