hurry home and\n      give birth to babes\n  What living and buried speech is always vibrating here what howls\n      restrain\u2019d by decorum\n  Arrests of criminals slights adulterous offers made acceptances\n      rejections with convex lips\n  I mind them or the show or resonance of them--I come and I depart.\n\n       9\n  The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready\n  The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon\n  The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged\n  The armfuls are pack\u2019d to the sagging mow.\n\n  I am there I help I came stretch\u2019d atop of the load\n  I felt its soft jolts one leg reclined on the other\n  I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy\n  And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.\n\n       10\n  Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt\n  Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee\n  In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night\n  Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill\u2019d game\n  Falling asleep on the gather\u2019d leaves with my dog and gun by my side.\n\n  The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails she cuts the sparkle and scud\n  My eyes settle the land I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.\n\n  The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me\n  I tuck\u2019d my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;\n  You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.\n\n  I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west\n      the bride was a red girl\n  Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking\n      they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets\n      hanging from their shoulders\n  On a bank lounged the trapper he was drest mostly in skins his luxuriant\n      beard and curls protected his neck he held his bride by the hand\n  She had long eyelashes her head was bare her coarse straight locks\n      descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach\u2019d to her feet.\n\n  The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside\n  I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile\n  Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak\n  And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him\n  And brought water and fill\u2019d a tub for his sweated body and bruis\u2019d feet\n  And gave him a room that enter\u2019d from my own and gave him some\n      coarse clean clothes\n  And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness\n  And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\n  He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass\u2019d north\n  I had him sit next me at table my fire-lock lean\u2019d in the corner.\n\n       11\n  Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore\n  Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;\n  Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.\n\n  She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank\n  She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.\n\n  Which of the young men does she like the best?\n  Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\n\n  Where are you off to lady? for I see you\n  You splash in the water there yet stay stock still in your room.\n\n  Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather\n  The rest did not see her but she saw them and loved them.\n\n  The beards of the young men glisten\u2019d with wet it ran from their long hair\n  Little streams pass\u2019d all over their bodies.\n\n  An unseen hand also pass\u2019d over their bodies\n  It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\n\n  The young men float on their backs their white bellies bulge to the\n      sun they do not ask who seizes fast to them\n  They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch\n  They do not think whom they souse with spray.\n\n       12\n  The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes or sharpens his knife\n      at the stall in the market\n  I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.\n\n  Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil\n  Each has his main-sledge they are all out there is a great heat in\n      the fire.\n\n  From the cinder-strew\u2019d threshold I follow their movements\n  The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms\n  Overhand the hammers swing overhand so slow overhand so sure\n  They do not hasten each man hits in his place.\n\n       13\n  The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses the block swags\n      underneath on its tied-over chain\n  The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard steady and\n      tall he stands pois\u2019d on one leg on the string-piece\n  His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over\n      his hip-band\n  His glance is calm and commanding he tosses the slouch of his hat\n      away from his forehead\n  The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache falls on the black of\n      his polish\u2019d and perfect limbs.\n\n  I behold the picturesque giant and love him and I do not stop there\n  I go with the team also.\n\n  In me the caresser of life wherever moving backward as well as\n      forward sluing\n  To niches aside and junior bending not a person or object missing\n  Absorbing all to myself and for this song.\n\n  Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade what\n      is that you express in your eyes?\n  It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\n\n  My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and\n      day-long ramble\n  They rise together they slowly circle around.\n\n  I believe in those wing\u2019d purposes\n  And acknowledge red yellow white playing within me\n  And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional\n  And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else\n  And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut yet trills pretty well to me\n  And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\n\n       14\n  The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night\n  Ya-honk he says and sounds it down to me like an invitation\n  The pert may suppose it meaningless but I listening close\n  Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.\n\n  The sharp-hoof\u2019d moose of the north the cat on the house-sill the\n      chickadee the prairie-dog\n  The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats\n  The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings\n  I see in them and myself the same old law.\n\n  The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections\n  They scorn the best I can do to relate them.\n\n  I am enamour\u2019d of growing out-doors\n  Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods\n  Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and\n      mauls and the drivers of horses\n  I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\n\n  What is commonest cheapest nearest easiest is Me\n  Me going in for my chances spending for vast returns\n  Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me\n  Not asking the sky to come down to my good will\n  Scattering it freely forever.\n\n       15\n  The pure contralto sings in the organ loft\n  The carpenter dresses his plank the tongue of his foreplane\n      whistles its wild ascending lisp\n  The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner\n  The pilot seizes the king-pin he heaves down with a strong arm\n  The mate stands braced in the whale-boat lance and harpoon are ready\n  The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches\n  The deacons are ordain\u2019d with cross\u2019d hands at the altar\n  The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel\n  The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe and\n      looks at the oats and rye\n  The lunatic

works at his case\n  He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;\n  The malform\u2019d limbs are tied to the surgeon\u2019s table\n  What is removed drops horribly in a pail;\n  The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand the drunkard nods by\n      the bar-room stove\n  The machinist rolls up his sleeves the policeman travels his beat\n      the gate-keeper marks who pass\n  The young fellow drives the express-wagon (I love him though I do\n      not know him;)\n  The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race\n  The western turkey-shooting draws old and young some lean on their\n      rifles some sit on logs\n  Out from the crowd steps the marksman takes his position levels his piece;\n  The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee\n  As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field the overseer views them\n      from his saddle\n  The bugle calls in the ball-room the gentlemen run for their\n      partners the dancers

for the knots\n  The one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne\n      her first child\n  The clean-hair\u2019d Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the\n      factory or mill\n  The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer the reporter\u2019s lead\n      flies swiftly over the note-book the sign-painter is lettering\n      with blue and gold\n  The canal boy trots on the tow-path the book-keeper counts at his\n      desk the shoemaker waxes his thread\n  The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him\n  The child is baptized the convert is making his first professions\n  The regatta is spread on the bay the race is begun (how the white\n      sails sparkle!)\n  The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray\n  The pedler sweats with his pack on his back (the purchaser higgling\n      about the odd cent;)\n  The bride unrumples her white dress the minute-hand of the clock\n      moves slowly\n  The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open\u2019d lips\n  The prostitute draggles her shawl her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and\n      pimpled neck\n  The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths the men jeer and

I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)\n  The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great\n      Secretaries\n  On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms\n  The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold\n  The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle\n  As the fare-collector goes through the

mechanic artist gentleman sailor quaker\n  Prisoner fancy-man rowdy lawyer physician priest.\n\n  I resist any thing better than my own diversity\n  Breathe the air but leave plenty after me\n  And am not stuck up and am in my place.\n\n  (The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place\n  The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place\n  The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)\n\n       17\n  These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands they\n      are not original with me\n  If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing or next to nothing\n  If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing\n  If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.\n\n  This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is\n  This the common air that bathes the globe.\n\n       18\n  With music strong I come with my cornets and my drums\n  I play not marches for accepted victors only I play marches for\n      conquer\u2019d and slain persons.\n\n  Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?\n  I also say it is good to fall battles are lost in the same spirit\n      in which they are won.\n\n  I beat and pound for the dead\n  I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.\n\n  Vivas to those who have fail\u2019d!\n  And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!\n  And to those themselves who sank in the sea!\n  And to all generals that lost engagements and all overcome heroes!\n  And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!\n\n       19\n  This is the meal equally set this the meat for natural hunger\n  It is for the wicked just same as the righteous I make appointments\n      with all\n  I will not have a single person slighted or left away\n  The kept-woman sponger thief are hereby invited\n  The heavy-lipp\u2019d slave is invited the venerealee is invited;\n  There shall be no difference between them and the rest.\n\n  This is the press of a bashful hand this the float and odor of hair\n  This the touch of my lips to yours this the murmur of yearning\n  This the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face\n  This the thoughtful merge of myself and the outlet again.\n\n  Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?\n  Well I have for the Fourth-month showers have and the mica on the\n      side of a rock has.\n\n  Do you take it I would astonish?\n  Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering\n      through the woods?\n  Do I astonish more than they?\n\n  This hour I tell things in confidence\n  I might not tell everybody but I will tell you.\n\n       20\n  Who goes there? hankering gross mystical nude;\n  How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?\n\n  What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?\n\n  All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own\n  Else it were time lost listening to me.\n\n  I do not snivel that snivel the world over\n  That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.\n\n  Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids conformity\n      goes to the fourth-remov\u2019d\n  I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.\n\n  Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?\n\n  Having pried through the strata analyzed to a hair counsel\u2019d with\n      doctors and calculated close\n  I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.\n\n  In all people I see myself none more and not one a barley-corn less\n  And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.\n\n  I know I am solid and sound\n  To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow\n  All are written to me and I must get what the writing means.\n\n  I know I am deathless\n  I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter\u2019s compass\n  I know I shall not pass like a child\u2019s carlacue cut with a burnt\n      stick at night.\n\n  I know I am august\n  I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood\n  I see that the elementary laws never apologize\n  (I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by\n      after all.)\n\n  I exist as I am that is enough\n  If no other in the world be aware I sit content\n  And if each and all be aware I sit content.\n\n  One world is aware and by far the largest to me and that is myself\n  And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten\n      million years\n  I can cheerfully take it now or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.\n\n  My foothold is tenon\u2019d and mortis\u2019d in granite\n  I laugh at what you call dissolution\n  And I know the amplitude of time.\n\n       21\n  I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul\n  The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me\n  The first I graft and increase upon myself the latter I translate\n      into new tongue.\n\n  I am the poet of the woman the same as the man\n  And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man\n  And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.\n\n  I chant the chant of dilation or pride\n  We have had ducking and deprecating about enough\n  I show that size is only development.\n\n  Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?\n  It is a trifle they will more than arrive there every one and\n      still pass on.\n\n  I am he that walks with the tender and growing night\n  I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.\n\n  Press close bare-bosom\u2019d night--press close magnetic nourishing night!\n  Night of south winds--night of the large few stars!\n  Still nodding night--mad naked summer night.\n\n  Smile O voluptuous cool-breath\u2019d earth!\n  Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!\n  Earth of departed sunset--earth of the mountains misty-topt!\n  Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!\n  Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!\n  Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!\n  Far-swooping elbow\u2019d earth--rich apple-blossom\u2019d earth!\n  Smile for your lover comes.\n\n  Prodigal you have given me love--therefore I to you give love!\n  O unspeakable passionate love.\n\n  Thruster holding me tight and that I hold tight!\n  We hurt each other as the bridegroom and the bride hurt each other.\n\n       22\n  You sea! I resign myself to you also--I guess what you mean\n  I behold from the beach your crooked fingers\n  I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me\n  We must have a turn together I undress hurry me out of sight of the land\n  Cushion me soft rock me in billowy drowse\n  Dash me with amorous wet I can repay you.\n\n  Sea of stretch\u2019d ground-swells\n  Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths\n  Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell\u2019d yet always-ready graves\n  Howler and scooper of storms capricious and dainty sea\n  I am integral with you I too am of one phase and of all phases.\n\n  Partaker of influx and efflux I extoller of hate and conciliation\n  Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others\u2019 arms.\n\n  I am he attesting sympathy\n  (Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that\n      supports them?)\n\n  I am not the poet of goodness only I do not decline to be the poet\n      of wickedness also.\n\n  What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?\n  Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me I stand indifferent\n  My gait is no fault-finder\u2019s or rejecter\u2019s gait\n  I moisten the roots of all that has grown.\n\n  Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?\n  Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work\u2019d over and rectified?\n\n  I find one side a balance and the antipedal side a balance\n  Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine\n  Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.\n\n  This minute that comes to me over the past decillions\n  There is no better than it and now.\n\n  What behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such wonder\n  The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.\n\n       23\n  Endless unfolding of words of ages!\n  And mine a word of the modern the word En-Masse.\n\n  A word of the faith that never balks\n  Here or henceforward it is all the same to me I accept Time absolutely.\n\n  It alone is without flaw it alone rounds and completes all\n  That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.\n\n  I accept Reality and dare not question it\n  Materialism first and last imbuing.\n\n  Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!\n  Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac\n  This is the lexicographer this the chemist this made a grammar of\n      the old cartouches\n  These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas.\n  This is the geologist this works with the scalper and this is a\n      mathematician.\n\n  Gentlemen to you the first honors always!\n  Your facts are useful and yet they are not my dwelling\n  I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.\n\n  Less the reminders of properties told my words\n  And more the reminders they of life untold and of freedom and extrication\n  And make short account of neuters and geldings and favor men and\n      women fully equipt\n  And beat the gong of revolt and stop with fugitives and them that\n      plot and conspire.\n\n       24\n  Walt Whitman a kosmos of Manhattan the son\n  Turbulent fleshy sensual eating drinking and breeding\n  No sentimentalist no stander above men and women or apart from them\n  No more modest than immodest.\n\n  Unscrew the locks from the doors!\n  Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!\n\n  Whoever degrades another degrades me\n  And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.\n\n  Through me the afflatus surging and surging through me the current\n      and index.\n\n  I speak the pass-word primeval I give the sign of democracy\n  By God!

Voices of the diseas\u2019d and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs\n  Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion\n  And of the threads that connect the stars and of wombs and of the\n

myself there is that lot of me and all so luscious\n  Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy\n  I cannot tell how my ankles bend nor whence the cause of my faintest wish\n  Nor the cause of the friendship I emit nor the cause of the\n      friendship I take again.\n\n  That I walk up my stoop I pause to consider if it really be\n  A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics\n      of books.\n\n  To behold the day-break!\n  The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows\n  The air tastes good to my palate.\n\n  Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising\n      freshly exuding\n  Scooting obliquely high and low.\n\n  Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs\n  Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.\n\n  The earth by the sky staid with the daily close of their junction\n  The heav\u2019d challenge from the east that moment over my head\n  The mocking taunt See then whether you shall be master!\n\n       25\n  Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me\n  If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.\n\n  We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun\n  We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.\n\n  My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach\n  With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.\n\n  Speech is the twin of my vision it is unequal to measure itself\n  It provokes me forever it says sarcastically\n  Walt you contain enough why don\u2019t you let it out then?\n\n  Come now I will not be tantalized you conceive too much of\n      articulation\n  Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?\n  Waiting in gloom protected by frost\n  The dirt receding before my prophetical screams\n  I underlying causes to balance them at last\n  My knowledge my live parts it keeping tally with the meaning of all things\n  Happiness (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search\n      of this day.)\n\n  My final merit I refuse you I refuse putting from me what I really am\n  Encompass worlds but never try to encompass me\n  I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.\n\n  Writing and talk do not prove me\n  I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face\n  With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.\n\n       26\n  Now I will do nothing but listen\n  To accrue what I hear into this song to let sounds contribute toward it.\n\n  I hear bravuras of birds bustle of growing wheat gossip of flames\n      clack of sticks cooking my meals\n  I hear the sound I love the sound of the human voice\n  I hear all sounds running together combined fused or following\n  Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city sounds of the day and night\n  Talkative young ones to those that like them the loud laugh of\n      work-people at their meals\n  The angry base of disjointed friendship the faint tones of the sick\n  The judge with hands tight to the desk his pallid lips pronouncing\n      a death-sentence\n  The heave\u2019e\u2019yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves the\n      refrain of the anchor-lifters\n  The ring of alarm-bells the cry of fire the whirr of swift-streaking\n      engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color\u2019d lights\n  The steam-whistle the solid roll of the train of approaching cars\n  The slow march play\u2019d at the head of the association marching two and two\n  (They go to guard some corpse the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)\n\n  I hear the violoncello (\u2019tis the young man\u2019s heart\u2019s complaint)\n  I hear the key\u2019d cornet it glides quickly in through my ears\n  It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.\n\n  I hear the chorus it is a grand opera\n  Ah this indeed is music--this suits me.\n\n  A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me\n  The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.\n\n  I hear the train\u2019d soprano (what work with hers is this?)\n  The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies\n  It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess\u2019d them\n  It sails me I dab with bare feet they are lick\u2019d by the indolent waves\n  I am cut by bitter and angry hail I lose my breath\n  Steep\u2019d amid honey\u2019d morphine my windpipe throttled in fakes of death\n  At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles\n  And that we call Being.\n\n       27\n  To be in any form what is that?\n  (Round and round we go all of us and ever come back thither)\n  If nothing lay more develop\u2019d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.\n\n  Mine is no callous shell\n  I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop\n  They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.\n\n  I merely stir press feel with my fingers and am happy\n  To touch my person to some one else\u2019s is about as much as I can stand.\n\n       28\n  Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity\n  Flames and ether making a rush for my veins\n  Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them\n  My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly\n      different from myself\n  On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs\n  Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip\n  Behaving licentious toward me taking no denial\n  Depriving me of my best as for a purpose\n  Unbuttoning my clothes holding me by the bare waist\n  Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields\n  Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away\n  They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me\n  No consideration no regard for my draining strength or my anger\n  Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while\n  Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.\n\n  The sentries desert every other part of me\n  They have left me helpless to a red marauder\n  They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.\n\n  I am given up by traitors\n  I talk wildly I have lost my wits I and nobody else am the\n      greatest traitor\n  I went myself first to the headland my own hands carried me there.\n\n  You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat\n  Unclench your floodgates you are too much for me.\n\n       29\n  Blind loving wrestling touch sheath\u2019d hooded sharp-tooth\u2019d touch!\n  Did it make you ache so leaving me?\n\n  Parting track\u2019d by arriving perpetual payment of perpetual loan\n  Rich showering rain and recompense richer afterward.\n\n  Sprouts take and accumulate stand by the curb prolific and vital\n  Landscapes projected masculine full-sized and golden.\n\n       30\n  All truths wait in all things\n  They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it\n  They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon\n  The insignificant is as big to me as any\n  (What is less or more than a touch?)\n\n  Logic and sermons never convince\n  The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.\n\n  (Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so\n  Only what nobody denies is so.)\n\n  A minute and a drop of me settle my brain\n  I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps\n  And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman\n  And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other\n  And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it\n      becomes omnific\n  And until one and all shall delight us and we them.\n\n       31\n  I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars\n  And the pismire is equally perfect and a grain of sand and the egg\n      of the wren\n  And the tree-toad is a chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre for the highest\n  And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven\n  And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery\n  And the cow crunching with depress\u2019d head surpasses any statue\n  And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.\n\n  I find I incorporate gneiss coal long-threaded moss fruits\n      grains esculent roots\n  And am stucco\u2019d with quadrupeds and birds all over\n  And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons\n  But call any thing back again when I desire it.\n\n  In vain the speeding or shyness\n  In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach\n  In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder\u2019d bones\n  In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes\n  In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low\n  In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky\n  In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs\n  In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods\n  In vain the razor-bill\u2019d auk sails far north to Labrador\n  I follow quickly I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.\n\n       32\n  I think I could turn and live with animals they are so placid and\n      self-contain\u2019d\n  I stand and look at them long and long.\n\n  They do not sweat and whine about their condition\n  They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins\n  They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God\n  Not one is dissatisfied not one is demented with the mania of\n      owning things\n  Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived thousands of\n      years ago\n  Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\n\n  So they show their relations to me and I accept them\n  They bring me tokens of myself they evince them plainly in their\n      possession.\n\n  I wonder where they get those tokens\n  Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?\n\n  Myself moving forward then and now and forever\n  Gathering and showing more always and with velocity\n  Infinite and omnigenous and the like of these among them\n  Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers\n  Picking out here one that I love and now go with him on brotherly terms.\n\n  A gigantic beauty of a stallion fresh and responsive to my caresses\n  Head high in the forehead wide between the ears\n  Limbs glossy and supple tail dusting the ground\n  Eyes full of sparkling wickedness ears finely cut flexibly moving.\n\n  His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him\n  His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.\n\n  I but use you a minute then I resign you stallion\n  Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?\n  Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.\n\n       33\n  Space and Time! now I see it is true what I guess\u2019d at\n  What I guess\u2019d when I loaf\u2019d on the grass\n  What I guess\u2019d while I lay alone in my bed\n  And again as I walk\u2019d the beach under the paling stars of the morning.\n\n  My ties and ballasts leave me my elbows rest in sea-gaps\n  I skirt sierras my palms cover continents\n  I am afoot with my vision.\n\n  By the city\u2019s quadrangular houses--in log huts camping with lumber-men\n  Along the ruts of the turnpike along the dry gulch and rivulet bed\n  Weeding my onion-patch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips\n      crossing savannas trailing in forests\n  Prospecting gold-digging girdling the trees of a new purchase\n  Scorch\u2019d ankle-deep by the hot sand hauling my boat down the\n      shallow river\n  Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead where the\n      buck turns furiously at the hunter\n  Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock where the\n      otter is feeding on fish\n  Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou\n  Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey where the\n      beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tall;\n  Over the growing sugar over the yellow-flower\u2019d cotton plant over\n      the rice in its low moist field\n  Over the sharp-peak\u2019d farm house with its scallop\u2019d scum and\n      slender shoots from the gutters\n  Over the western persimmon over the long-leav\u2019d corn over the\n      delicate blue-flower flax\n  Over the white and brown buckwheat a hummer and buzzer there with\n      the rest\n  Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;\n  Scaling mountains pulling myself cautiously up holding on by low\n      scragged limbs\n  Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush\n  Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot\n  Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve where the great\n      goldbug drops through the dark\n  Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to\n      the meadow\n  Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous\n      shuddering of their hides\n  Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen where andirons straddle\n      the hearth-slab where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;\n  Where trip-hammers crash where the press is whirling its cylinders\n  Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs\n  Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft (floating in it\n      myself and looking composedly down)\n  Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose where the heat\n      hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand\n  Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it\n  Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke\n  Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water\n  Where the half-burn\u2019d brig is riding on unknown currents\n  Where shells grow to her slimy deck where the dead are corrupting below;\n  Where the dense-starr\u2019d flag is borne at the head of the regiments\n  Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island\n  Under Niagara the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance\n  Upon a door-step upon the horse-block of hard wood outside\n  Upon the race-course or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of\n      base-ball\n  At he-festivals with blackguard gibes ironical license\n      bull-dances drinking laughter\n  At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash sucking the\n      juice through a straw\n  At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find\n  At musters beach-parties friendly bees huskings house-raisings;\n  Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles cackles\n      screams weeps\n  Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard where the dry-stalks are\n      scatter\u2019d where the brood-cow waits in the hovel\n  Where the bull advances to do his masculine work where the stud to\n      the mare where the cock is treading the hen\n  Where the heifers browse where geese nip their food with short jerks\n  Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie\n  Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles\n      far and near\n  Where the humming-bird shimmers where the neck of the long-lived\n      swan is curving and winding\n  Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore where she laughs her\n      near-human laugh\n  Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the\n      high weeds\n  Where band-neck\u2019d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with\n      their heads out\n  Where burial coaches enter the arch\u2019d gates of a cemetery\n  Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees\n  Where the yellow-crown\u2019d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at\n      night and feeds upon small crabs\n  Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon\n  Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over\n      the well\n  Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves\n  Through the salt-lick or orange glade or under conical firs\n  Through the gymnasium through the curtain\u2019d saloon through the\n      office or public hall;\n  Pleas\u2019d with the native and pleas\u2019d with the foreign pleas\u2019d with\n      the new and old\n  Pleas\u2019d with the homely woman as well as the handsome\n  Pleas\u2019d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously\n  Pleas\u2019d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash\u2019d church\n  Pleas\u2019d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher\n      impress\u2019d seriously at the camp-meeting;\n  Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon\n      flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass\n  Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn\u2019d up to the clouds\n      or down a lane or along the beach\n  My right and left arms round the sides of two friends and I in the middle;\n  Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek\u2019d bush-boy (behind me\n      he rides at the drape of the day)\n  Far from the settlements studying the print of animals\u2019 feet or the\n      moccasin print\n  By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient\n  Nigh the coffin\u2019d corpse when all is still examining with a candle;\n  Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure\n  Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any\n  Hot toward one I hate ready in my madness to knife him\n  Solitary at midnight in my back yard my thoughts gone from me a long while\n  Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side\n  Speeding through space speeding through heaven and the stars\n  Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring and the\n      diameter of eighty thousand miles\n  Speeding with tail\u2019d meteors throwing fire-balls like the rest\n  Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly\n  Storming enjoying planning loving cautioning\n  Backing and filling appearing and disappearing\n  I tread day and night such roads.\n\n  I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product\n  And look at quintillions ripen\u2019d and look at quintillions green.\n\n  I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul\n  My course runs below the soundings of plummets.\n\n  I help myself to material and immaterial\n  No guard can shut me off no law prevent me.\n\n  I anchor my ship for a little while only\n  My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.\n\n  I go hunting polar furs and the seal leaping chasms with a\n      pike-pointed staff clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\n\n  I ascend to the foretruck\n  I take my place late at night in the crow\u2019s-nest\n  We sail the arctic sea it is plenty light enough\n  Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty\n  The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them the scenery is\n      plain in all directions\n  The white-topt mountains show in the distance I fling out my\n      fancies toward them\n  We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to\n      be engaged\n  We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment we pass with still\n      feet and caution\n  Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin\u2019d city\n  The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities\n      of the globe.\n\n  I am a free companion I bivouac by invading watchfires\n  I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself\n  I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\n\n  My voice is the wife\u2019s voice the screech by the rail of the stairs\n  They fetch my man\u2019s body up dripping and drown\u2019d.\n\n  I understand the large hearts of heroes\n  The courage of present times and all times\n  How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the\n      steamship and Death chasing it up and down the storm\n  How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch and was faithful of\n      days and faithful of nights\n  And chalk\u2019d in large letters on a board Be of good cheer we will\n      not desert you;\n  How he follow\u2019d with them and tack\u2019d with them three days and\n      would not give it up\n  How he saved the drifting company at last\n  How the lank loose-gown\u2019d women look\u2019d when boated from the\n      side of their prepared graves\n  How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick and the\n      sharp-lipp\u2019d unshaved men;\n  All this I swallow it tastes good I like it well it becomes mine\n  I am the man I suffer\u2019d I was there.\n\n  The disdain and calmness of martyrs\n  The mother of old condemn\u2019d for a witch burnt with dry wood her\n      children gazing on\n  The hounded slave that flags in the race leans by the fence\n      blowing cover\u2019d with sweat\n  The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck the murderous\n      buckshot and the bullets\n  All these I feel or am.\n\n  I am the hounded slave I wince at the bite of the dogs\n  Hell and despair are upon me crack and again crack the marksmen\n  I clutch the rails of the fence my gore dribs thinn\u2019d with the\n      ooze of my skin\n  I fall on the weeds and stones\n  The riders spur their unwilling horses haul close\n  Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\n\n  Agonies are one of my changes of garments\n  I do not ask the wounded person how he feels I myself become the\n      wounded person\n  My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\n\n  I am the mash\u2019d fireman with breast-bone broken\n  Tumbling walls buried me in their debris\n  Heat and smoke I inspired I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades\n  I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels\n  They have clear\u2019d the beams away they tenderly lift me forth.\n\n  I lie in the night air in my red shirt the pervading hush is for my sake\n  Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy\n  White and beautiful are the faces around me the heads are bared\n      of their fire-caps\n  The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\n\n  Distant and dead resuscitate\n  They show as the dial or move as the hands of me I am the clock myself.\n\n  I am an old artillerist I tell of my fort\u2019s bombardment\n  I am there again.\n\n  Again the long roll of the drummers\n  Again the attacking cannon mortars\n  Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.\n\n  I take part I see and hear the whole\n  The cries curses roar the plaudits for well-aim\u2019d shots\n  The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip\n  Workmen searching after damages making indispensable repairs\n  The fall of grenades through the rent roof the fan-shaped explosion\n  The whizz of limbs heads stone wood iron high in the air.\n\n  Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general he furiously waves\n      with his hand\n  He gasps through the clot Mind not me--mind--the entrenchments.\n\n       34\n  Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth\n  (I tell not the fall of Alamo\n  Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo\n  The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo)\n  \u2019Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve\n      young men.\n\n  Retreating they had form\u2019d in a hollow square with their baggage for\n      breastworks\n  Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies nine times their\n      number was the price they took in advance\n  Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone\n  They treated for an honorable capitulation receiv\u2019d writing and\n      seal gave up their arms and march\u2019d back prisoners of war.\n\n  They were the glory of the race of rangers\n  Matchless with horse rifle song supper courtship\n  Large turbulent generous handsome proud and affectionate\n  Bearded sunburnt drest in the free costume of hunters\n  Not a single one over thirty years of age.\n\n  The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and\n      massacred it was beautiful early summer\n  The work commenced about five o\u2019clock and was over by eight.\n\n  None obey\u2019d the command to kneel\n  Some made a mad and helpless rush some stood stark and straight\n  A few fell at once shot in the temple or heart the living and dead\n      lay together\n  The maim\u2019d and mangled dug in the dirt the new-comers saw them there\n  Some half-kill\u2019d attempted to crawl away\n  These were despatch\u2019d with bayonets or batter\u2019d with the blunts of muskets\n  A youth not seventeen years old seiz\u2019d his assassin till two more\n      came to release him\n  The three were all torn and cover\u2019d with the boy\u2019s blood.\n\n  At eleven o\u2019clock began the burning of the bodies;\n  That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\n\n       35\n  Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\n  Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\n  List to the yarn as my grandmother\u2019s father the sailor told it to me.\n\n  Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you (said he)\n  His was the surly English pluck and there is no tougher or truer\n      and never was and never will be;\n  Along the lower\u2019d eve he came horribly raking us.\n\n  We closed with him the yards entangled the cannon touch\u2019d\n  My captain lash\u2019d fast with his own hands.\n\n  We had receiv\u2019d some eighteen pound shots under the water\n  On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire\n      killing all around and blowing up overhead.\n\n  Fighting at sun-down fighting at dark\n  Ten o\u2019clock at night the full moon well up our leaks on the gain\n      and five feet of water reported\n  The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold\n      to give them a chance for themselves.\n\n  The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels\n  They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\n\n  Our frigate takes fire\n  The other asks if we demand quarter?\n  If our colors are struck and the fighting done?\n\n  Now I laugh content for I hear the voice of my little captain\n  We have not struck he composedly cries we have just begun our part\n      of the fighting.\n\n  Only three guns are in use\n  One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy\u2019s main-mast\n  Two well serv\u2019d with grape and canister silence his musketry and\n      clear his decks.\n\n  The tops alone second the fire of this little battery especially\n      the main-top\n  They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\n\n  Not a moment\u2019s cease\n  The leaks gain fast on the pumps the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\n\n  One of the pumps has been shot away it is generally thought we are sinking.\n\n  Serene stands the little captain\n  He is not hurried his voice is neither high nor low\n  His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\n\n  Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.\n\n       36\n  Stretch\u2019d and still lies the midnight\n  Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness\n  Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking preparations to pass to the\n      one we have conquer\u2019d\n  The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a\n      countenance white as a sheet\n  Near by the corpse of the child that serv\u2019d in the cabin\n  The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully\n      curl\u2019d whiskers\n  The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below\n  The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty\n  Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves dabs of flesh\n      upon the masts and spars\n  Cut of cordage dangle of rigging slight shock of the soothe of waves\n  Black and impassive guns litter of powder-parcels strong scent\n  A few large stars overhead silent and mournful shining\n  Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze smells of sedgy grass and fields by\n      the shore death-messages given in charge to survivors\n  The hiss of the surgeon\u2019s knife the gnawing teeth of his saw\n  Wheeze cluck swash of falling blood short wild scream and long\n      dull tapering groan\n  These so these irretrievable.\n\n       37\n  You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\n  In at the conquer\u2019d doors they crowd! I am possess\u2019d!\n  Embody all presences outlaw\u2019d or suffering\n  See myself in prison shaped like another man\n  And feel the dull unintermitted pain.\n\n  For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch\n  It is I let out in the morning and barr\u2019d at night.\n\n  Not a mutineer walks handcuff\u2019d to jail but I am handcuff\u2019d to him\n      and walk by his side\n  (I am less the jolly one there and more the silent one with sweat\n      on my twitching lips.)\n\n  Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too and am tried\n      and sentenced.\n\n  Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp\n  My face is ash-color\u2019d my sinews gnarl away from me people retreat.\n\n  Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them\n  I project my hat sit shame-faced and beg.\n\n       38\n  Enough! enough! enough!\n  Somehow I have been stunn\u2019d. Stand back!\n  Give me a little time beyond my cuff\u2019d head slumbers dreams gaping\n  I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.\n\n  That I could forget the mockers and insults!\n  That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the\n      bludgeons and hammers!\n  That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and\n      bloody crowning.\n\n  I remember now\n  I resume the overstaid fraction\n  The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it or to any graves\n  Corpses rise gashes heal fastenings roll from me.\n\n  I troop forth replenish\u2019d with supreme power one of an average\n      unending procession\n  Inland and sea-coast we go and pass all boundary lines\n  Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth\n  The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.\n\n  Eleves I salute you! come forward!\n  Continue your annotations continue your questionings.\n\n       39\n  The friendly and flowing savage who is he?\n  Is he waiting for civilization or past it and mastering it?\n\n  Is he some Southwesterner rais\u2019d out-doors? is he Kanadian?\n  Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa Oregon California?\n  The mountains? prairie-life bush-life? or sailor from the sea?\n\n  Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him\n  They desire he should like them touch them speak to them stay with them.\n\n  Behavior lawless as snow-flakes words simple as grass uncomb\u2019d\n      head laughter and naivete\n  Slow-stepping feet common features common modes and emanations\n  They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers\n  They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath they fly out of\n      the glance of his eyes.\n\n       40\n  Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask--lie over!\n  You light surfaces only I force surfaces and depths also.\n\n  Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands\n  Say old top-knot what do you want?\n\n  Man or woman I might tell how I like you but cannot\n  And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you but cannot\n  And might tell that pining I have that pulse of my nights and days.\n\n  Behold I do not give lectures or a little charity\n  When I give I give myself.\n\n  You there impotent loose in the knees\n  Open your scarf\u2019d chops till I blow grit within you\n  Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets\n  I am not to be denied I compel I have stores plenty and to spare\n  And any thing I have I bestow.\n\n  I do not ask who you are that is not important to me\n  You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.\n\n  To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean\n  On his right cheek I put the family kiss\n  And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.\n\n  On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes.\n  (This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)\n\n  To any one dying thither I speed and twist the knob of the door.\n  Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed\n  Let the physician and the priest go home.\n\n  I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will\n  O despairer here is my neck\n  By God you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me.\n\n  I dilate you with tremendous breath I buoy you up\n  Every room of the house do I fill with an arm\u2019d force\n  Lovers of me bafflers of graves.\n\n  Sleep--I and they keep guard all night\n  Not doubt not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you\n  I have embraced you and henceforth possess you to myself\n  And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.\n\n       41\n  I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs\n  And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.\n\n  I heard what was said of the universe\n  Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;\n  It is middling well as far as it goes--but is that all?\n\n  Magnifying and applying come I\n  Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters\n  Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah\n  Lithographing Kronos Zeus his son and Hercules his grandson\n  Buying drafts of Osiris Isis Belus Brahma Buddha\n  In my portfolio placing Manito loose Allah on a leaf the crucifix\n      engraved\n  With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and image\n  Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more\n  Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days\n  (They bore mites as for unfledg\u2019d birds who have now to rise and fly\n      and sing for themselves)\n  Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself\n      bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see\n  Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house\n  Putting higher claims for him there with his roll\u2019d-up sleeves\n      driving the mallet and chisel\n  Not objecting to special revelations considering a curl of smoke or\n      a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation\n  Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me\n      than the gods of the antique wars\n  Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction\n  Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr\u2019d laths their white\n      foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;\n  By the mechanic\u2019s wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for\n      every person born\n  Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels\n      with shirts bagg\u2019d out at their waists\n  The snag-tooth\u2019d hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come\n  Selling all he possesses traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his\n      brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;\n  What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me and\n      not filling the square rod then\n  The bull and the bug never worshipp\u2019d half enough\n  Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream\u2019d\n  The supernatural of no account myself waiting my time to be one of\n      the supremes\n  The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the\n      best and be as prodigious;\n  By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator\n  Putting myself here and now to the ambush\u2019d womb of the shadows.\n\n\n      42\n  A call in the midst of the crowd\n  My own voice orotund sweeping and final.\n\n  Come my children\n  Come my boys and girls my women household and intimates\n  Now the performer launches his nerve he has pass\u2019d his prelude on\n      the reeds within.\n\n  Easily written loose-finger\u2019d chords--I feel the thrum of your\n      climax and close.\n\n  My head slues round on my neck\n  Music rolls but not from the organ\n  Folks are around me but they are no household of mine.\n\n  Ever the hard unsunk ground\n  Ever the eaters and drinkers ever the upward and downward sun ever\n      the air and the ceaseless tides\n  Ever myself and my neighbors refreshing wicked real\n  Ever the old inexplicable query ever that thorn\u2019d thumb that\n      breath of itches and thirsts\n  Ever the vexer\u2019s hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides\n      and bring him forth\n  Ever love ever the sobbing liquid of life\n  Ever the bandage under the chin ever the trestles of death.\n\n  Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking\n  To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning\n  Tickets buying taking selling but in to the feast never once going\n  Many sweating ploughing thrashing and then the chaff for payment\n      receiving\n  A few idly owning and they the wheat continually claiming.\n\n  This is the city and I am one of the citizens\n  Whatever interests the rest interests me politics wars markets\n      newspapers schools\n  The mayor and councils banks tariffs steamships factories\n      stocks stores real estate and personal estate.\n\n  The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail\u2019d coats\n  I am aware who they are (they are positively not worms or fleas)\n  I acknowledge the duplicates of myself the weakest and shallowest\n      is deathless with me\n  What I do and say the same waits for them\n  Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them.\n\n  I know perfectly well my own egotism\n  Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less\n  And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.\n\n  Not words of routine this song of mine\n  But abruptly to question to leap beyond yet nearer bring;\n  This printed and bound book--but the printer and the\n      printing-office boy?\n  The well-taken photographs--but your wife or friend close and solid\n      in your arms?\n  The black ship mail\u2019d with iron her mighty guns in her turrets--but\n      the pluck of the captain and engineers?\n  In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture--but the host and\n      hostess and the look out of their eyes?\n  The sky up there--yet here or next door or across the way?\n  The saints and sages in history--but you yourself?\n  Sermons creeds theology--but the fathomless human brain\n  And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?\n\n       43\n  I do not despise you priests all time the world over\n  My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths\n  Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern\n  Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years\n  Waiting responses from oracles honoring the gods saluting the sun\n  Making a fetich of the first rock or stump powowing with sticks in\n      the circle of obis\n  Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols\n  Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession rapt and\n      austere in the woods a gymnosophist\n  Drinking mead from the skull-cap to Shastas and Vedas admirant\n      minding the Koran\n  Walking the teokallis spotted with gore from the stone and knife\n      beating the serpent-skin drum\n  Accepting the Gospels accepting him that was crucified knowing\n      assuredly that he is divine\n  To the mass kneeling or the puritan\u2019s prayer rising or sitting\n      patiently in a pew\n  Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis or waiting dead-like till\n      my spirit arouses me\n  Looking forth on pavement and land or outside of pavement and land\n  Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.\n\n  One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like\n      man leaving charges before a journey.\n\n  Down-hearted doubters dull and excluded\n  Frivolous sullen moping angry affected dishearten\u2019d atheistical\n  I know every one of you I know the sea of torment doubt despair\n      and unbelief.\n\n  How the flukes splash!\n  How they contort rapid as lightning with spasms and spouts of blood!\n\n  Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers\n  I take my place among you as much as among any\n  The past is the push of you me all precisely the same\n  And what is yet untried and afterward is for you me all precisely\n      the same.\n\n  I do not know what is untried and afterward\n  But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient and cannot fail.\n\n  Each who passes is consider\u2019d each who stops is consider\u2019d not\n      single one can it fall.\n\n  It cannot fall the young man who died and was buried\n  Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side\n  Nor the little child that peep\u2019d in at the door and then drew back\n      and was never seen again\n  Nor the old man who has lived without purpose and feels it with\n      bitterness worse than gall\n  Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder\n  Nor the numberless slaughter\u2019d and wreck\u2019d nor the brutish koboo\n      call\u2019d the ordure of humanity\n  Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in\n  Nor any thing in the earth or down in the oldest graves of the earth\n  Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres nor the myriads of myriads\n      that inhabit them\n  Nor the present nor the least wisp that is known.\n\n       44\n  It is time to explain myself--let us stand up.\n\n  What is known I strip away\n  I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.\n\n  The clock indicates the moment--but what does eternity indicate?\n\n  We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers\n  There are trillions ahead and trillions ahead of them.\n\n  Births have brought us richness and variety\n  And other births will bring us richness and variety.\n\n  I do not call one greater and one smaller\n  That which fills its period and place is equal to any.\n\n  Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you my brother my sister?\n  I am sorry for you they are not murderous or jealous upon me\n  All has been gentle with me I keep no account with lamentation\n  (What have I to do with lamentation?)\n\n  I am an acme of things accomplish\u2019d and I an encloser of things to be.\n\n  My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs\n  On every step bunches of ages and larger bunches between the steps\n  All below duly travel\u2019d and still I mount and mount.\n\n  Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me\n  Afar down I see the huge first Nothing I know I was even there\n  I waited unseen and always and slept through the lethargic mist\n  And took my time and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.\n\n  Long I was hugg\u2019d close--long and long.\n\n  Immense have been the preparations for me\n  Faithful and friendly the arms that have help\u2019d me.\n\n  Cycles ferried my cradle rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen\n  For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings\n  They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.\n\n  Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me\n  My embryo has never been torpid nothing could overlay it.\n\n  For it the nebula cohered to an orb\n  The long slow strata piled to rest it on\n  Vast vegetables gave it sustenance\n  Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it\n      with care.\n\n  All forces have been steadily employ\u2019d to complete and delight me\n  Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.\n\n\n      45\n  O span of youth! ever-push\u2019d elasticity!\n  O manhood balanced florid and full.\n\n  My lovers suffocate me\n  Crowding my lips thick in the pores of my skin\n  Jostling me through streets and public halls coming naked to me at night\n  Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river swinging and\n      chirping over my head\n  Calling my name from flower-beds vines tangled underbrush\n  Lighting on every moment of my life\n  Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses\n  Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.\n\n  Old age superbly rising! O welcome ineffable grace of dying days!\n\n  Every condition promulges not only itself it promulges what grows\n      after and out of itself\n  And the dark hush promulges as much as any.\n\n  I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems\n  And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of\n      the farther systems.\n\n  Wider and wider they spread expanding always expanding\n  Outward and outward and forever outward.\n\n  My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels\n  He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit\n  And greater sets follow making specks of the greatest inside them.\n\n  There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage\n  If I you and the worlds and all beneath or upon their surfaces\n      were this moment reduced back to a pallid float it would\n      not avail the long run\n  We should surely bring up again where we now stand\n  And surely go as much farther and then farther and farther.\n\n  A few quadrillions of eras a few octillions of cubic leagues do\n      not hazard the span or make it impatient\n  They are but parts any thing is but a part.\n\n  See ever so far there is limitless space outside of that\n  Count ever so much there is limitless time around that.\n\n  My rendezvous is appointed it is certain\n  The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms\n  The great Camerado the lover true for whom I pine will be there.\n\n       46\n  I know I have the best of time and space and was never measured and\n      never will be measured.\n\n  I tramp a perpetual journey (come listen all!)\n  My signs are a rain-proof coat good shoes and a staff cut from the woods\n  No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair\n  I have no chair no church no philosophy\n  I lead no man to a dinner-table library exchange\n  But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll\n  My left hand hooking you round the waist\n  My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.\n\n  Not I not any one else can travel that road for you\n  You must travel it for yourself.\n\n  It is not far it is within reach\n  Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know\n  Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.\n\n  Shoulder your duds dear son and I will mine and let us hasten forth\n  Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.\n\n  If you tire give me both burdens and rest the chuff of your hand\n      on my hip\n  And in due time you shall repay the same service to me\n  For after we start we never lie by again.\n\n  This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look\u2019d at the crowded heaven\n  And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs\n      and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them shall we\n      be fill\u2019d and satisfied then?\n  And my spirit said No we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond.\n\n  You are also asking me questions and I hear you\n  I answer that I cannot answer you must find out for yourself.\n\n  Sit a while dear son\n  Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink\n  But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes I kiss you\n      with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.\n\n  Long enough have you dream\u2019d contemptible dreams\n  Now I wash the gum from your eyes\n  You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every\n      moment of your life.\n\n  Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore\n  Now I will you to be a bold swimmer\n  To jump off in the midst of the sea rise again nod to me shout\n      and laughingly dash with your hair.\n\n       47\n  I am the teacher of athletes\n  He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own\n  He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.\n\n  The boy I love the same becomes a man not through derived power\n      but in his own right\n  Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear\n  Fond of his sweetheart relishing well his steak\n  Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts\n  First-rate to ride to fight to hit the bull\u2019s eye to sail a\n      skiff to sing a song or play on the banjo\n  Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over\n      all latherers\n  And those well-tann\u2019d to those that keep out of the sun.\n\n  I teach straying from me yet who can stray from me?\n  I follow you whoever you are from the present hour\n  My words itch at your ears till you understand them.\n\n  I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while\n      I wait for a boat\n  (It is you talking just as much as myself I act as the tongue of you\n  Tied in your mouth in mine it begins to be loosen\u2019d.)\n\n  I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house\n  And I swear I will never translate myself at all only to him or her\n      who privately stays with me in the open air.\n\n  If you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore\n  The nearest gnat is an explanation and a drop or motion of waves key\n  The maul the oar the hand-saw second my words.\n\n  No shutter\u2019d room or school can commune with me\n  But roughs and little children better than they.\n\n  The young mechanic is closest to me he knows me well\n  The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with\n      him all day\n  The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice\n  In vessels that sail my words sail I go with fishermen and seamen\n      and love them.\n\n  The soldier camp\u2019d or upon the march is mine\n  On the night ere the pending battle many seek me and I do not fail them\n  On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.\n  My face rubs to the hunter\u2019s face when he lies down alone in his blanket\n  The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon\n  The young mother and old mother comprehend me\n  The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are\n  They and all would resume what I have told them.\n\n       48\n  I have said that the soul is not more than the body\n  And I have said that the body is not more than the soul\n  And nothing not God is greater to one than one\u2019s self is\n  And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own\n      funeral drest in his shroud\n  And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth\n  And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the\n      learning of all times\n  And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it\n      may become a hero\n  And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel\u2019d universe\n  And I say to any man or woman Let your soul stand cool and composed\n      before a million universes.\n\n  And I say to mankind Be not curious about God\n  For I who am curious about each am not curious about God\n  (No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and\n      about death.)\n\n  I hear and behold God in every object yet understand God not in the least\n  Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.\n\n  Why should I wish to see God better than this day?\n  I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four and each moment then\n  In the faces of men and women I see God and in my own face in the glass\n  I find letters from God dropt in the street and every one is sign\u2019d\n      by God\u2019s name\n  And I leave them where they are for I know that wheresoe\u2019er I go\n  Others will punctually come for ever and ever.\n\n       49\n  And as to you Death and you bitter hug of mortality it is idle to\n      try to alarm me.\n\n  To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes\n  I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting\n  I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors\n  And mark the outlet and mark the relief and escape.\n\n  And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure but that does not\n      offend me\n  I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing\n  I reach to the leafy lips I reach to the polish\u2019d breasts of melons.\n\n  And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths\n  (No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)\n\n  I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven\n  O suns--O grass of graves--O perpetual transfers and promotions\n  If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?\n\n  Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest\n  Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight\n  Toss sparkles of day and dusk--toss on the black stems that decay\n      in the muck\n  Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.\n\n  I ascend from the moon I ascend from the night\n  I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected\n  And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.\n\n       50\n  There is that in me--I do not know what it is--but I know it is in me.\n\n  Wrench\u2019d and sweaty--calm and cool then my body becomes\n  I sleep--I sleep long.\n\n  I do not know it--it is without name--it is a word unsaid\n  It is not in any dictionary utterance symbol.\n\n  Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on\n  To it the creation

me.\n\n       3\n  You air that serves me with breath to speak!\n  You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape!\n  You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers!\n  You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!\n  I believe you are latent with unseen existences you are so dear to me.\n\n  You flagg\u2019d walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!\n  You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined\n      side! you distant ships!\n  You rows of houses! you window-pierc\u2019d facades! you roofs!\n  You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!\n  You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!\n  You doors and ascending steps! you arches!\n  You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!\n  From all that has touch\u2019d you I believe you have imparted to\n      yourselves and now would impart the same secretly to me\n  From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces\n      and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me.\n\n       4\n  The earth expanding right hand and left hand\n  The picture alive every part in its best light\n  The music falling in where it is wanted and stopping where it is\n      not wanted\n  The cheerful voice of the public road the gay fresh sentiment of the road.\n\n  O highway I travel do you say to me Do not leave me?\n  Do you say Venture not--if you leave me you are lost?\n  Do you say I am already prepared I am well-beaten and undenied\n      adhere to me?\n\n  O public road I say back I am not afraid to leave you yet I love you\n  You express me better than I can express myself\n  You shall be more to me than my poem.\n\n  I think heroic deeds were all conceiv\u2019d in the open air and all\n      free poems also\n  I think I could stop here myself and do miracles\n  I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like and whoever\n      beholds me shall like me\n  I think whoever I see must be happy.\n\n       5\n  From this hour I ordain myself loos\u2019d of limits and imaginary lines\n  Going where I list my own master total and absolute\n  Listening to others considering well what they say\n  Pausing searching receiving contemplating\n  Gently but with undeniable will divesting myself of the holds that\n      would hold me.\n\n  I inhale great draughts of space\n  The east and the west are mine and the north and the south are mine.\n\n  I am larger better than I thought\n  I did not know I held so much goodness.\n\n  All seems beautiful to me\n  can repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me\n      I would do the same to you\n  I will recruit for myself and you as I go\n  I will scatter myself among men and women as I go\n  I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them\n  Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me\n  Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me.\n\n       6\n  Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me\n  Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear\u2019d it would not\n      astonish me.\n\n  Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons\n  It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.\n\n  Here a great personal deed has room\n  (Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men\n  Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all\n      authority and all argument against it.)\n\n  Here is the test of wisdom\n  Wisdom is not finally tested in schools\n  Wisdom cannot be pass\u2019d from one having it to another not having it\n  Wisdom is of the soul is not susceptible of proof is its own proof\n  Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content\n  Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things and the\n      excellence of things;\n  Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes\n      it out of the soul.\n\n  Now I re-examine philosophies and religions\n  They may prove well in lecture-rooms yet not prove at all under the\n      spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents.\n\n  Here is realization\n  Here is a man tallied--he realizes here what he has in him\n  The past the future majesty love--if they are vacant of you you\n      are vacant of them.\n\n  Only the kernel of every object nourishes;\n  Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?\n  Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?\n\n  Here is adhesiveness it is not previously fashion\u2019d it is apropos;\n  Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?\n  Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?\n\n       7\n  Here is the efflux of the soul\n  The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower\u2019d gates\n      ever provoking questions\n  These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they?\n  Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight\n      expands my blood?\n  Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?\n  Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious\n      thoughts descend upon me?\n  (I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always\n      drop fruit as I pass;)\n  What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?\n  What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?\n  What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by\n      and pause?\n  What gives me to be free to a woman\u2019s and man\u2019s good-will? what\n      gives them to be free to mine?\n\n       8\n  The efflux of the soul is happiness here is happiness\n  I think it pervades the open air waiting at all times\n  Now it flows unto us we are rightly charged.\n\n  Here rises the fluid and attaching character\n  The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of\n      man and woman\n  (The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day\n      out of the roots of themselves than it sprouts fresh and sweet\n      continually out of itself.)\n\n  Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the\n      love of young and old\n  From it falls distill\u2019d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments\n  Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.\n\n       9\n  Allons! whoever you are come travel with me!\n  Traveling with me you find what never tires.\n\n  The earth never tires\n  The earth is rude silent incomprehensible at first Nature is rude\n      and incomprehensible at first\n  Be not discouraged keep on there are divine things well envelop\u2019d\n  I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell.\n\n  Allons! we must not stop here\n  However sweet these laid-up stores however convenient this dwelling\n      we cannot remain here\n  However shelter\u2019d this

I will be honest with you\n  I do not offer the old smooth prizes but offer rough new prizes\n  These are the days that must happen to you:\n  You shall not heap up what is call\u2019d riches\n  You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve\n  You but arrive at the city to which you were destin\u2019d you hardly\n      settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call\u2019d by an\n      irresistible call to depart\n  You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those\n      who remain behind you\n  What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with\n      passionate kisses of parting\n  You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach\u2019d hands\n      toward you.\n\n       12\n  Allons! after the great Companions and to belong to them!\n  They too are on the road--they are the swift and majestic men--they\n      are the greatest women\n  Enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas\n  Sailors of many a ship walkers of many a mile of land\n  Habitues of many distant countries habitues of far-distant dwellings\n  Trusters of men and women observers of cities solitary toilers\n  Pausers and contemplators of tufts blossoms shells of the shore\n  Dancers at wedding-dances kissers of brides tender helpers of\n      children bearers of children\n  Soldiers of revolts standers by gaping graves lowerers-down of coffins\n  Journeyers over consecutive seasons over the years the curious\n      years each emerging from that which preceded it\n  Journeyers as with companions namely their own diverse phases\n  Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days\n  Journeyers gayly with their own youth journeyers with their bearded\n      and well-grain\u2019d manhood\n  Journeyers with their womanhood ample unsurpass\u2019d content\n  Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood\n  Old age calm expanded broad with the haughty breadth of the universe\n  Old age flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death.\n\n       13\n  Allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless\n  To undergo much tramps of days rests of nights\n  To merge all in the travel they tend to and the days and nights\n      they tend to\n  Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys\n  To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it\n  To conceive no time however distant but what you may reach it and pass it\n  To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you\n      however long but it stretches and waits for you\n  To see no being not God\u2019s or any but you also go thither\n  To see no possession but you may possess it enjoying all without\n      labor or purchase abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one\n      particle of it\n  To take the best of the farmer\u2019s farm and the rich man\u2019s elegant\n      villa and the chaste blessings of the well-married couple and\n      the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens\n  To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through\n  To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go\n  To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter\n      them to gather the love out of their hearts\n  To take your lovers on the road with you for all that you leave\n      them behind you\n  To know the universe itself as a road as many roads as roads for\n      traveling souls.\n\n  All parts away for the progress of souls\n  All religion all solid things arts governments--all that was or is\n      apparent upon this globe or any globe falls into niches and corners\n      before the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe.\n\n  Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of\n      the universe all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance.\n\n  Forever alive forever forward\n  Stately solemn sad withdrawn baffled mad turbulent feeble\n      dissatisfied\n  Desperate proud fond sick accepted by men rejected by men\n  They go! they go!

I see you face to face!\n  Clouds of the west--sun there half an hour high--I see you also face\n      to face.\n\n  Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes how curious\n      you are to me!\n  On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross returning\n      home are more curious to me than you suppose\n  And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more\n      to me and more in my meditations than you might suppose.\n\n       2\n  The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day\n  The simple compact well-join\u2019d scheme myself disintegrated every\n      one disintegrated yet part of the scheme\n  The similitudes of the past and those of the future\n  The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings on\n      the walk in the street and the passage over the river\n  The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away\n  The others that are to follow me the ties between me and them\n  The certainty of others the life love sight hearing of others.\n\n  Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore\n  Others will watch the run of the flood-tide\n  Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west and the\n      heights of Brooklyn to the south and east\n  Others will see the islands large and small;\n  Fifty years hence others will see them as they cross the sun half\n      an hour high\n  A hundred years hence or ever so many hundred years hence others\n      will see them\n  Will enjoy the sunset the pouring-in of the flood-tide the\n      falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.\n\n       3\n  It avails not time nor place--distance avails not\n  I am with you you men and women of a generation or ever so many\n      generations hence\n  Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky so I felt\n  Just as any of you is one of a living crowd I was one of a crowd\n  Just as you are refresh\u2019d by the gladness of the river and the\n      bright flow I was refresh\u2019d\n  Just as you stand and lean on the rail yet hurry with the swift\n      current I stood yet was hurried\n  Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the\n      thick-stemm\u2019d pipes of steamboats I look\u2019d.\n\n  I too many and many a time cross\u2019d the river of old\n  Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls saw them high in the air\n      floating with motionless wings oscillating their bodies\n  Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left\n      the rest in strong shadow\n  Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south\n  Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water\n  Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams\n  Look\u2019d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my\n      head in the sunlit water\n  Look\u2019d on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward\n  Look\u2019d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet\n  Look\u2019d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving\n  Saw their approach saw aboard those that were near me\n  Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops saw the ships at anchor\n  The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars\n  The round masts the swinging motion of the hulls the slender\n      serpentine pennants\n  The large and small steamers in motion the pilots in their pilothouses\n  The white wake left by the passage the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels\n  The flags of all nations the falling of them at sunset\n  The scallop-edged waves in the twilight the ladled cups the\n      frolic-some crests and glistening\n  The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer the gray walls of the\n      granite storehouses by the docks\n  On the river the shadowy group the big steam-tug closely flank\u2019d on\n      each side by the barges the hay-boat the belated lighter\n  On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning\n      high and glaringly into the night\n  Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow\n      light over the tops of houses and down into the clefts of streets.\n\n       4\n  These and all else were to me the same as they are to you\n  I loved well those cities loved well the stately and rapid river\n  The men and women I saw were all near to me\n  Others the

count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?\n\n  Whatever it is it avails not--distance avails not and place avails not\n  I too lived Brooklyn of ample hills was mine\n  I too walk\u2019d the streets of Manhattan island and bathed in the\n      waters around it\n  I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me\n  In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me\n  In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me\n  I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution\n  I too had receiv\u2019d identity by my body\n  That I was I knew was of my body and what I should be I knew I\n      should be of my body.\n\n       6\n  It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall\n  The dark threw its patches down upon me also\n  The best I had done seem\u2019d to me blank and suspicious\n  My great thoughts as I supposed them were they not in reality meagre?\n  Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil\n  I am he who

wayward vain greedy shallow sly cowardly malignant\n  The wolf the snake the hog not wanting in me.\n  The cheating look the frivolous word the adulterous wish not wanting\n\n  Refusals hates postponements meanness laziness none of these wanting\n  Was one with the rest the days and haps of the rest\n  Was call\u2019d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as\n      they saw me approaching or passing\n  Felt their arms on my neck as I stood or the negligent leaning of\n      their flesh against me as I sat\n  Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly yet\n      never told them a word\n  Lived the same life with the rest the same old laughing gnawing sleeping\n  Play\u2019d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress\n  The same old role

mast-hemm\u2019d Manhattan?\n  River and sunset and scallop-edg\u2019d waves of flood-tide?\n  The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies the hay-boat in the\n      twilight and the belated lighter?\n

departing or hamadryads departing\n  A murmuring fateful giant voice out of the earth and sky\n  Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense.\n\n  Farewell my brethren\n  Farewell O earth and sky farewell ye neighboring waters\n  My time has ended my term has come.\n\n  Along the northern coast\n  Just back from the rock-bound shore and the caves\n  In the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country\n  With the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse\n  With crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by strong arms\n  Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes there in the redwood\n      forest dense\n  I heard the might tree its death-chant chanting.\n\n  The choppers heard not the camp shanties echoed not\n  The quick-ear\u2019d teamsters and chain and jack-screw men heard not\n  As the wood-spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to\n      join the refrain\n  But in my soul I plainly heard.\n\n  Murmuring out of its myriad leaves\n  Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high\n  Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs out of its foot-thick bark\n  That chant of the seasons and time chant not of the past only but\n      the future.\n\n  You untold life of me\n  And all you venerable and innocent joys\n  Perennial hardy life of me with joys \u2019mid rain and many a summer sun\n  And the white snows and night and the wild

curves angles dots?\n  No those are not the words the substantial words are in the ground\n      and sea\n  They are in the air they are in you.\n\n  Were you thinking that those were the words those delicious sounds\n      out of your friends\u2019 mouths?\n  No the real words are more delicious than they.\n\n  Human bodies are words myriads of words\n  (In the best poems re-appears the body man\u2019s or woman\u2019s\n      well-shaped natural gay\n  Every part able active receptive without shame or the need of shame.)\n\n  Air soil water fire--those are words\n  I myself am a word with them--my qualities interpenetrate with\n      theirs--my name is nothing to them\n  Though it were told in the three thousand languages what would\n      air soil water fire know of my name?\n\n  A healthy presence a friendly or commanding gesture are words\n      sayings meanings\n  The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women\n      are sayings and meanings also.\n\n  The workmanship of souls is by those inaudible words of the earth\n  The masters know the earth\u2019s words and use them more than audible words.\n\n  Amelioration is one of the earth\u2019s words\n  The earth neither lags nor hastens\n  It has all attributes growths effects latent in itself from the jump\n  It is not half beautiful only defects and excrescences show just as\n      much as perfections show.\n\n  The earth does not withhold it is generous enough\n  The truths of the earth continually wait they are not so conceal\u2019d either\n  They are calm subtle untransmissible by print\n  They are imbued through all things conveying themselves willingly\n  Conveying a sentiment and invitation I utter and utter\n  I speak not yet if you hear me not of what avail am I to you?\n  To bear to better lacking these of what avail am I?\n\n  (Accouche! accouchez!\n  Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?\n  Will you squat and stifle there?)\n\n  The earth does not argue\n  Is not pathetic has no arrangements\n  Does not scream haste persuade threaten promise\n  Makes no discriminations has no conceivable failures\n  Closes nothing refuses nothing shuts none out\n  Of all the powers objects states it notifies shuts none out.\n\n  The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to exhibit itself\n      possesses still underneath\n  Underneath the ostensible sounds the august chorus of heroes the\n      wail of slaves\n  Persuasions of lovers curses gasps of the dying laughter of young\n      people accents of bargainers\n  Underneath these possessing words that never fall.\n\n  To her children the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail\n  The true words do not fail for motion does not fail and reflection\n      does not fall\n  Also the day and night do not fall and the voyage we pursue does not fall.\n\n  Of the interminable sisters\n  Of the ceaseless cotillons of sisters\n  Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters the elder and younger sisters\n  The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.\n\n  With her ample back towards every beholder\n  With the fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations of age\n  Sits she whom I too love like the rest sits undisturb\u2019d\n  Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror while her\n      eyes glance back from it\n  Glance as she sits inviting none denying none\n  Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face.\n\n  Seen at hand or seen at a distance\n  Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day\n  Duly approach and pass with their companions or a companion\n  Looking from no countenances of their own but from the countenances\n      of those who are with them\n  From the countenances of children or women or the manly countenance\n  From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate things\n  From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition of the sky\n  From our countenances mine and yours faithfully returning them\n  Every day in public appearing without fall but never twice with the\n      same companions.\n\n  Embracing man embracing all proceed the three hundred and\n      sixty-five resistlessly round the sun;\n  Embracing all soothing supporting follow close three hundred and\n      sixty-five offsets of the first sure and necessary as they.\n\n  Tumbling on steadily nothing dreading\n  Sunshine storm cold heat forever withstanding passing carrying\n  The soul\u2019s realization and determination still inheriting\n  The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing\n  No balk retarding no anchor anchoring on no rock striking\n  Swift glad content unbereav\u2019d nothing losing\n  Of all able and ready at any time to give strict account\n  The divine ship sails the divine sea.\n\n       2\n  Whoever you are! motion and reflection are especially for you\n  The divine ship sails the divine sea for you.\n\n  Whoever you are! you are he or she for whom the earth is solid and liquid\n  You are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the sky\n  For none more than you are the present and the past\n  For none more than you is immortality.\n\n  Each man to himself and each woman to herself is the word of the\n      past and present and the true word of immortality;\n  No one can acquire for another--not one\n  Not one can grow for another--not one.\n\n  The song is to the singer and comes back most to him\n  The teaching is to the teacher and comes back most to him\n  The murder is to the murderer and comes back most to him\n  The theft is to the thief and comes back most to him\n  The love is to the lover and comes back most to him\n  The gift is to the giver and comes back most to him--it cannot fail\n  The oration is to the orator the acting is to the actor and actress\n      not to the audience\n  And no man understands any greatness or goodness but his own or\n      the indication of his own.\n\n       3\n  I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who shall\n      be complete\n  The earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who remains\n      jagged and broken.\n\n  I swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate those\n      of the earth\n  There can be no theory of any account unless it corroborate the\n      theory of the earth\n  No politics song religion behavior or what not is of account\n      unless it compare with the amplitude of the earth\n  Unless it face the exactness vitality impartiality rectitude of\n      the earth.\n\n  I swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that which\n      responds love\n  It is that which contains itself which never invites and never refuses.\n\n  I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible words\n  All merges toward the presentation of the unspoken meanings of the earth\n  Toward him who sings the songs of the body and of the truths of the earth\n  Toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print cannot touch.\n\n  I swear I see what is better than to tell the best\n  It is always to leave the best untold.\n\n  When I undertake to tell the best I find I cannot\n  My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots\n  My breath will not be obedient to its organs\n  I become a dumb man.\n\n  The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow all or any is best\n  It is not what you anticipated it is cheaper easier nearer\n  Things are not dismiss\u2019d from the places they held before\n  The earth is just as positive and direct as it was before\n  Facts religions improvements politics trades are as real as before\n  But the soul is also real it too is positive and direct\n  No reasoning no proof has establish\u2019d it\n  Undeniable growth has establish\u2019d it.\n\n       4\n  These to echo the tones of souls and the phrases of souls\n  (If they did not echo the phrases of souls what were they then?\n  If they had not reference to you in especial what were they then?)\n\n  I swear I will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tells\n      the best\n  I will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best untold.\n\n  Say on sayers! sing on singers!\n  Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth!\n  Work on age after age nothing is to be lost\n  It may have to wait long but it will certainly come in use\n  When the materials are all prepared and ready the architects shall appear.\n\n  I swear to you the architects shall appear without fall\n  I swear to you they will understand you and justify you\n  The greatest among them shall be he who best knows you and encloses\n      all and is faithful to all\n  He and the rest shall not forget you they shall perceive that you\n      are not an iota less than they\n  You shall be fully glorified in

you see south and south-\n      east and south-west\n  Over hills across lowlands and in the skirts of woods\n  And along the shores in mire (now fill\u2019d over) came again and\n      suddenly raged\n  As eighty-five years agone no mere parade receiv\u2019d with applause of friends\n  But a battle which I took part in myself--aye long ago as it is I\n      took part in it\n  Walking then this hilltop this same ground.\n\n  Aye this is the ground\n  My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from graves\n  The years recede pavements and stately houses disappear\n  Rude forts appear again the old hoop\u2019d guns are mounted\n  I see the lines of rais\u2019d earth stretching from river to bay\n  I mark the vista of waters I mark the uplands and slopes;\n  Here we lay encamp\u2019d it was this time in summer also.\n\n  As I talk I remember all I remember the Declaration\n  It was read here the whole army paraded it was read to us here\n  By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle he held up\n      his unsheath\u2019d sword\n  It glitter\u2019d in the sun in full sight of the army.\n\n  \u2019Twas a bold act then--the English war-ships had just arrived\n  We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor\n  And the transports swarming with soldiers.\n\n  A few days more and they landed and then the battle.\n\n  Twenty thousand were brought against us\n  A veteran force furnish\u2019d with good artillery.\n\n  I tell not now the whole of the battle\n  But one brigade early in the forenoon order\u2019d forward to engage the\n      red-coats\n  Of that brigade I tell and how steadily it march\u2019d\n  And how long and well it stood confronting death.\n\n  Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death?\n  It was the brigade of the youngest men two thousand strong\n  Rais\u2019d in Virginia and Maryland and most of them known personally\n      to the General.\n\n  Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus\u2019 waters\n  Till of a sudden unlook\u2019d for by defiles through the woods gain\u2019d at night\n  The British advancing rounding in from the east fiercely playing\n      their guns\n  That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy\u2019s mercy.\n\n  The General watch\u2019d them from this hill\n  They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment\n  Then drew close together very compact their flag flying in the middle\n  But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!\n\n  It sickens me yet that slaughter!\n  I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.\n  I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.\n\n  Meanwhile the British man\u0153uvr\u2019d to draw us out for a pitch\u2019d battle\n  But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch\u2019d battle.\n\n  We fought the fight in detachments\n  Sallying forth we fought at several points but in each the luck was\n      against us\n  Our foe advancing steadily getting the best of it push\u2019d us back\n      to the works on this hill\n  Till we turn\u2019d menacing here and then he left us.\n\n  That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men two thousand\n      strong\n  Few return\u2019d nearly all remain in Brooklyn.\n\n  That and here my General\u2019s first battle\n  No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in it did not conclude\n      with applause\n  Nobody clapp\u2019d hands here then.\n\n  But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain\n  Wearied that night we lay foil\u2019d and sullen\n  While

Thee\n  In shackles prison\u2019d in disgrace repining not\n  Accepting all from Thee as duly come from Thee.\n\n  All my emprises have been fill\u2019d with Thee\n  My speculations plans begun and

stretch\u2019d and still\n  How quiet they breathe the little children in their cradles.\n\n  The wretched features of ennuyes the white features of corpses the\n      livid faces of drunkards the

restless sink in their beds they fitfully sleep.\n\n  Now I pierce the darkness new beings appear\n  The earth recedes from me into the night\n  I saw that it was beautiful and I see that what is not

hide nothing and would not if they could\n  I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides\n  And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk\n  To lift their cunning covers to signify

courageous arms he urges himself with his legs\n  I see his white body I see his undaunted eyes\n  I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on\n      the rocks.\n\n  What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?\n  Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime\n      of his middle age?\n\n  Steady and long he struggles\n  He is baffled

Confused a past-reading another but with darkness yet.\n\n  The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind the wreck-guns sound\n  The tempest lulls the moon comes floundering through the drifts.\n\n  I look where the ship helplessly heads end on I hear the burst as\n      she strikes I hear the howls of dismay they grow fainter and fainter.\n\n  I cannot aid with my wringing fingers\n  I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me.\n\n  I search with the crowd not one of the company is wash\u2019d to us alive\n  In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn.\n\n       5\n  Now of the older war-days the defeat at Brooklyn\n  Washington stands inside the lines he stands on the intrench\u2019d\n      hills amid a crowd of officers.\n  His face is cold and damp he cannot repress the weeping drops\n  He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes the color is blanch\u2019d\n      from his cheeks\n  He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by\n      their parents.\n\n  The same at last and at last when peace is declared\n  He stands in the room of the old tavern the well-belov\u2019d soldiers\n      all pass through\n  The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns\n  The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek\n  He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another he shakes hands\n      and bids good-by to the army.\n\n       6\n  Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together\n  Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on\n      the old

half-envelop\u2019d\n      her face\n  Her step was free and elastic and her voice sounded exquisitely as\n      she spoke.\n\n  My mother look\u2019d in delight and amazement at the stranger\n  She look\u2019d at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and\n      pliant limbs\n  The more she look\u2019d upon her she loved her\n  Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity\n  She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace she cook\u2019d\n      food for her\n  She had no work to give her but she gave her remembrance and fondness.\n\n  The red squaw staid all the forenoon and toward the middle of the\n      afternoon she went away\n  O my mother was loth to have her go away\n  All the week she thought of her she watch\u2019d for her many a month\n  She remember\u2019d her many a winter and many a summer\n  But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.\n\n       7\n  A show of the summer softness--a contact of something unseen--an\n
