{"THE WORLD": "I saw Eternity the other night,\nLike a great ring of pure and endless light,\nAll calm, as it was bright;\nAnd round beneath it, Time in hours, days, years,\nDriv'n by the spheres\nLike a vast shadow mov'd; in which the world\nAnd all her train were hurl'd.\nThe doting lover in his quaintest strain\nDid there complain;\nNear him, his lute, his fancy, and his flights,\nWit's sour delights,\nWith gloves, and knots, the silly snares of pleasure,\nYet his dear treasure\nAll scatter'd lay, while he his eyes did pour\nUpon a flow'r.\nThe darksome statesman hung with weights and woe,\nLike a thick midnight-fog mov'd there so slow,\nHe did not stay, nor go;\nCondemning thoughts (like sad eclipses) scowl\nUpon his soul,\nAnd clouds of crying witnesses without\nPursued him with one shout.\nYet digg'd the mole, and lest his ways be found,\nWork'd under ground,\nWhere he did clutch his prey; but one did see\nThat policy;\nChurches and altars fed him; perjuries\nWere gnats and flies;\nIt rain'd about him blood and tears, but he\nDrank them as free.\nThe fearful miser on a heap of rust\nSate pining all his life there, did scarce trust\nHis own hands with the dust,\nYet would not place one piece above, but lives\nIn fear of thieves;\nThousands there were as frantic as himself,\nAnd hugg'd each one his pelf;\nThe downright epicure plac'd heav'n in sense,\nAnd scorn'd pretence,\nWhile others, slipp'd into a wide excess,\nSaid little less;\nThe weaker sort slight, trivial wares enslave,\nWho think them brave;\nAnd poor despised Truth sate counting by\nTheir victory.\nYet some, who all this while did weep and sing,\nAnd sing, and weep, soar'd up into the ring;\nBut most would use no wing.\nO fools (said I) thus to prefer dark night\nBefore true light,\nTo live in grots and caves, and hate the day\nBecause it shews the way,\nThe way, which from this dead and dark abode\nLeads up to God,\nA way where you might tread the sun, and be\nMore bright than he.\nBut as I did their madness so discuss\nOne whisper'd thus,\n\"This ring the Bridegroom did for none provide,\nBut for his bride.\"", "THE RELAPSE": "My God, how gracious art thou! I had slipt\nAlmost to hell,\nAnd on the verge of that dark, dreadful pit\nDid hear them yell,\nBut O thy love! thy rich, almighty love\nThat sav'd my soul,\nAnd checkt their fury, when I saw them move,\nAnd heard them howl;\nO my sole comfort, take no more these ways,\nThis hideous path,\nAnd I will mend my own without delays,\nCease thou thy wrath!\nI have deserv'd a thick, Egyptian damp,\nDark as my deeds,\nShould mist within me, and put out that lamp\nThy spirit feeds;\nA darting conscience full of stabs and fears;\nNo shade but Yew,\nSullen, and sad eclipses, cloudy spheres,\nThese are my due.\nBut he that with his blood, (a price too dear,)\nMy scores did pay,\nBid me, by virtue from him, challenge here\nThe brightest day;\nSweet, downy thoughts; soft lily-shades; calm streams;\nJoys full and true;\nFresh, spicy mornings; and eternal beams\nThese are his due.", "THEY ARE ALL GONE INTO THE WORLD OF LIGHT": "They are all gone into the world of light!\nAnd I alone sit ling'ring here;\nTheir very memory is fair and bright,\nAnd my sad thoughts doth clear.\nIt glows and glitters in my cloudy breast,\nLike stars upon some gloomy grove,\nOr those faint beams in which this hill is drest,\nAfter the sun's remove.\nI see them walking in an air of glory,\nWhose light doth trample on my days:\nMy days, which are at best but dull and hoary,\nMere glimmering and decays.\nO holy Hope! and high Humility,\nHigh as the heavens above!\nThese are your walks, and you have show'd them me\nTo kindle my cold love.\nDear, beauteous Death! the jewel of the just,\nShining nowhere, but in the dark;\nWhat mysteries do lie beyond thy dust\nCould man outlook that mark!\nHe that hath found some fledg'd bird's nest, may know\nAt first sight, if the bird be flown;\nBut what fair well or grove he sings in now,\nThat is to him unknown.\nAnd yet as angels in some brighter dreams\nCall to the soul, when man doth sleep:\nSo some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes\nAnd into glory peep.\nIf a star were confin'd into a tomb,\nHer captive flames must needs burn there;\nBut when the hand that lock'd her up, gives room,\nShe'll shine through all the sphere.\nO Father of eternal life, and all\nCreated glories under thee!\nResume thy spirit from this world of thrall\nInto true liberty.\nEither disperse these mists, which blot and fill\nMy perspective still as they pass,\nOr else remove me hence unto that hill,\nWhere I shall need no glass.", "MOUNT OF OLIVES": "Sweet, sacred hill! on whose fair brow\nMy Saviour sate, shall I allow\nLanguage to love,\nAnd idolize some shade, or grove,\nNeglecting thee?
