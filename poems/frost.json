The view was all in lines\nStraight up and down of tall slim trees\nToo much alike to mark or name a place by\nSo as to say for certain I was here\nOr somewhere else: I was just far from home.\nA small bird flew before me. He was careful\nTo put a tree between us when he lighted\nAnd say no word to tell me who he was\nWho was so foolish as to think what _he_ thought.\nHe thought that I was after him for a feather\u2014-\nThe white one in his tail; like one who takes\nEverything said as personal to himself.\nOne flight out sideways would have undeceived him.\nAnd then there was a pile of wood for which\nI forgot him and let his little fear\nCarry him off the way I might have gone\nWithout so much as wishing him good-night.\nHe went behind it to make his last stand.\nIt was a cord of maple cut and split\nAnd piled\u2014-and measured four by four by eight.\nAnd not another like it could I see.\nNo runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.\nAnd it was older sure than this year's cutting\nOr even last year's or the year's before.\nThe wood was gray and the bark warping off it\nAnd the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis\nHad wound strings round and round it like a bundle.\nWhat held it though on one side was a tree\nStill growing and on one a stake and prop\nThese latter about to fall. I thought that only\nSomeone who lived in turning to fresh tasks\nCould so forget his handiwork on which\nHe spent himself the labour of his axe\nAnd leave it there far from a useful fireplace\nTo warm the frozen swamp as best it could\nWith the slow smokeless burning of decay.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\nSNOW\n\n\nThe three stood listening to a fresh access\nOf wind that caught against the house a moment\nGulped snow and then blew free again\u2014-the Coles\nDressed but dishevelled from some hours of sleep\nMeserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore.\n\nMeserve was first to speak. He pointed backward\nOver his shoulder with his pipe-stem saying\n\"You can just see it glancing off the roof\nMaking a great scroll upward toward the sky\nLong enough for recording all our names on;\nI think I'll just call up my wife and tell her\nI'm here\u2014-so far\u2014-and starting on again.\nI'll call her softly so that if she's wise\nAnd gone to sleep she needn't wake to answer.\"\nThree times he barely stirred the bell then listened.\n\"Why Lett still up?

Well at least\nI didn't use it out of love of him\nThe dear knows.

He's been here half an hour.\nHe says he left the village store at nine.\nThree hours to do four miles\u2014-a mile an hour\nOr not much better.

You don't know the kind.\nHe's getting up a miracle this minute.\nPrivately\u2014-to himself right now he's thinking\nHe'll make a case of it if he succeeds\nBut keep still if he fails.\"\n\n\"Keep still all over.\nHe'll be dead--dead and buried.\"\n\n\"Such a trouble!\nNot but I've every reason not to care\nWhat happens to him if it only takes\nSome of the sanctimonious conceit\nOut of one of those pious scalawags.\"\n\n\"Nonsense to that!

My wife here\nSays it won't do. You've got to give it up.\"\n\n\"Won't you to please me? Please! If I say please?\nMr. Meserve I'll leave it to _your_ wife.\nWhat _did_ your wife say on the telephone?\"\n\nMeserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp\nOr something not far from it on the table.\nBy straightening out and lifting a forefinger\nHe pointed with his hand from where it lay\nLike a white crumpled spider on his knee:\n\"That leaf there in your open book! It moved\nJust then I thought. It's stood erect like that\nThere on the table ever since I came\nTrying to turn itself backward or forward\nI've had my eye on it to make out which;\nIf forward then it's with a friend's impatience\u2014-\nYou see I know\u2014-to get you on to things\nIt wants to see how you will take if backward\nIt's from regret for something you have passed\nAnd failed to see the good of. Never mind\nThings must expect to come in front of us\nA many times\u2014-I don't say just how many\u2014-\nThat varies with the things\u2014-before we see them.\nOne of the lies would make it out that nothing\nEver presents itself before us twice.\nWhere would we be at last if that were so?\nOur very life depends on everything's\nRecurring till we answer from within.\nThe thousandth time may prove the charm.\u2014-That\nleaf!\nIt can't turn either way. It needs the wind's help.\nBut the wind didn't move it if it moved.\nIt moved itself. The wind's at naught in here.\nIt couldn't stir so sensitively poised\nA thing as that. It couldn't reach the lamp\nTo get a puff of black smoke from the flame\nOr blow a rumple in the collie's coat.\nYou make a little foursquare block of air\nQuiet and light and warm in spite of all\nThe illimitable dark and cold and storm\nAnd by so doing give these three lamp dog\nAnd book-leaf that keep near you their repose;\nThough for all anyone can tell repose\nMay be the thing you haven't yet you give it.\nSo false it is that what we haven't we can't give;\nSo false that what we always say is true.\nI'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.\nIt won't lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't want to hurry you Meserve\nBut if you're going\u2014- Say you'll stay you know?\nBut let me raise this curtain on a scene\nAnd show you how it's piling up against you.\nYou see the snow-white through the white of frost?\nAsk Helen how far up the sash it's climbed\nSince last we read the gage.\"\n\n\"It looks as if\nSome pallid thing had squashed its features flat\nAnd its eyes shut with overeagerness\nTo see what people found so interesting\nIn one another and had gone to sleep\nOf its own stupid lack of understanding\nOr broken its white neck of mushroom stuff\nShort off and died against the window-pane.\"\n\n\"Brother Meserve take care you'll scare yourself\nMore than you will us with such nightmare talk.\nIt's you it matters to because it's you\nWho have to go out into it alone.\"\n\n\"Let him talk Helen and perhaps he'll stay.\"\n\n\"Before you drop the curtain\u2014-I'm reminded:\nYou recollect the boy who came out here\nTo breathe the air one winter\u2014-had a room\nDown at the Averys'? Well one sunny morning\nAfter a downy storm he passed our place\nAnd found me banking up the house with snow.\nAnd I was burrowing in deep for warmth\nPiling it well above the window-sills.\nThe snow against the window caught his eye.\n'Hey that's a pretty thought'\u2014-those were his\nwords.\n'So you can think it's six feet deep outside\nWhile you sit warm and read up balanced rations.\nYou can't get too much winter in the winter.'\nThose were his words. And he went home and\nall\nBut banked the daylight out of Avery's windows.\nNow you and I would go to no such length.\nAt the same time you can't deny it makes\nIt not a mite worse sitting here we three\nPlaying our fancy to have the snowline run\nSo high across the pane outside. There where\nThere is a sort of tunnel in the frost\nMore like a tunnel than a hole\u2014-way down\nAt the far end of it you see a stir\nAnd quiver like the frayed edge of the drift\nBlown in the wind. I _like_ that\u2014-I like that.\nWell now I leave you people.\"\n\n\"Come Meserve\nWe thought you were deciding not to go\u2014-\nThe ways you found to say the praise of comfort\nAnd being where you are. You want to stay.\"\n\n\"I'll own it's cold for such a fall of snow.\nThis house is frozen brittle all except\nThis room you sit in. If you think the wind\nSounds further off it's not because it's dying;\nYou're further under in the snow\u2014-that's all\u2014-\nAnd feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dust\nIt bursts against us at the chimney mouth\nAnd at the eaves. I like it from inside\nMore than I shall out in it. But the horses\nAre rested and it's time to say good-night\nAnd let you get to bed again. Good-night\nSorry I had to break in on your sleep.\"\n\n\"Lucky for you you did. Lucky for you\nYou had us for a half-way station\nTo stop at. If you were the kind of man\nPaid heed to women you'd take my advice\nAnd for your family's sake stay where you are.\nBut what good is my saying it over and over?\nYou've done more than you had a right to think\nYou could do\u2014-_now._ You know the risk you take\nIn going on.\"\n\n\"Our snow-storms as a rule\nAren't looked on as man-killers and although\nI'd rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep\nUnder it all his door sealed up and lost\nThan the man fighting it to keep above it\nYet think of the small birds at roost and not\nIn nests. Shall I be counted less than they are?\nTheir bulk in water would be frozen rock\nIn no time out to-night. And yet to-morrow\nThey will come budding boughs from tree to tree\nFlirting their wings and saying Chickadee\nAs if not knowing what you meant by the word\nstorm.\"\n\n\"But why when no one wants you to go on?\nYour wife\u2014-she doesn't want you to. We don't\nAnd you yourself don't want to. Who else is there?\"\n\n\"Save us from being cornered by a woman.\nWell there's\"\u2014-She told Fred afterward that in\nThe pause right there she thought the dreaded word\nWas coming \"God.\" But no he only said\n\"Well there's\u2014-the storm. That says I must go on.\nThat wants me as a war might if it came.\nAsk any man.\"\n\nHe threw her that as something\nTo last her till he got outside the door.\n\nHe had Cole with him to the barn to see him off.\nWhen Cole returned he found his wife still standing\nBeside the table near the open book\nNot reading it.\n\n\"Well what kind of a man\nDo you call that?\" she said.\n\n\"He had the gift\nOf words or is it tongues I ought to say?\"\n\n\"Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?\"\n\n\"Or disregarding peopled civil questions\u2014-\nWhat? We've found out in one hour more about\nhim\nThan we had seeing him pass by in the road\nA thousand times. If that's the way he preaches!\nYou didn't think you'd keep him after all.\nOh I'm not blaming you. He didn't leave you\nMuch say in the matter and I'm just as glad\nWe're not in for a night of him. No sleep\nIf he had stayed. The least thing set him going.\nIt's quiet as an empty church without him.\"\n\n\"But how much better off are we as it is?\nWe'll have to sit here till we know he's safe.\"\n\n\"Yes I suppose you'll want to but I shouldn't.\nHe knows what he can do or he wouldn't try.\nGet into bed I say and get some rest.\nHe won't come back and if he telephones\nIt won't be for an hour or two.\"\n\n\"Well then\nWe can't be any help by sitting here\nAnd living his fight through with him I suppose.\n\n-----\n\nCole had been telephoning in the dark.\nMrs. Cole's voice came from an inner room:\n\"Did she call you or you call her?\"\n\n\"She me.\nYou'd better dress: you won't go back to bed.\nWe must have been asleep: it's three and after.\"\n\n\"Had she been ringing long? I'll get my wrapper.\nI want to speak to her.\"\n\n\"All she said was\nHe hadn't come and had he really started.\"\n\n\"She knew he had poor thing two hours ago.\n\n\"He had the shovel. Hell have made a fight.\"\n\n\"Why did I ever let him leave this house!\"\n\n\"Don't begin that. You did the best you could\nTo keep him\u2014-though perhaps you didn't quite\nConceal a wish to see him show the spunk\nTo disobey you. Much his wife'll thank you.\"\n\n\"Fred after all I said! You shan't make out\nThat it was any way but what it was.\nDid she let on by any word she said\nShe didn't thank me?\"\n\n\"When I told her 'Gone'\n'Well then' she said and 'Well then'\u2014-like a\nthreat.\nAnd then her voice came scraping slow: 'Oh you\nWhy did you let him go'?\"\n\n\"Asked why we let him?\nYou let me there. I'll ask her why she let him.\nShe didn't dare to speak when he was here.\nTheir number's\u2014-twenty-one? The thing won't\nwork.\nSomeone's receiver's down.

Watch this husky swarming up\nOver the wheel into the sky-high seat\nLighting his pipe now squinting down his nose\nAt the flame burning downward as he sucks it.\"\n\n\"See how it makes his nose-side bright a proof\nHow dark it's getting. Can you tell what time\nIt is by that? Or by the moon? The new moon!\nWhat shoulder did I see her over? Neither.\nA wire she is of silver as new as we\nTo everything. Her light won't last us long.\nIt's something though to know we're going to\nhave her\nNight after night and stronger every night\nTo see us through our first two weeks. But Joe\nThe stove! Before they go! Knock on the window;\nAsk them to help you get it on its feet.\nWe stand here dreaming. Hurry! Call them back!\"\n\n\"They're not gone yet.\"\n\n\"We've got to have the stove\nWhatever else we want for. And a light.\nHave we a piece of candle if the lamp\nAnd oil are buried out of reach?\"\n\nAgain\nThe house was full of tramping and the dark\nDoor-filling men burst in and seized the stove.\nA cannon-mouth-like hole was in the wall\nTo which they set it true by eye; and then\nCame up the jointed stovepipe in their hands\nSo much too light and airy for their strength\nIt almost seemed to come ballooning up\nSlipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling.\n\"A fit!\" said one and banged a stovepipe shoulder.\n\"It's good luck when you move in to begin\nWith good luck with your stovepipe. Never mind\nIt's not so bad in the country settled down\nWhen people 're getting on in life. You'll like it.\"\nJoe said: \"You big boys ought to find a farm\nAnd make good farmers and leave other fellows\nThe city work to do. There's not enough\nFor everybody as it is in there.\"\n\"God!\" one said wildly and when no one spoke:\n\"Say that to Jimmy here. He needs a farm.\"\nBut Jimmy only made his jaw recede\nFool-like and rolled his eyes as if to say\nHe saw himself a farmer. Then there was a French\nboy\nWho said with seriousness that made them laugh\n\"Ma friend you ain't know what it is you're ask.\"\nHe doffed his cap and held it with both hands\nAcross his chest to make as 'twere a bow:\n\"We're giving you our chances on de farm.\"\nAnd then they all turned to with deafening boots\nAnd put each other bodily out of the house.\n\"Goodby to them! We puzzle them.

But they left us so\nAs to our fate like fools past reasoning with.\nThey almost shook _me._\"\n\n\"It's all so much\nWhat we have always wanted I confess\nIt's seeming bad for a moment makes it seem\nEven worse still and so on down down down.\nIt's nothing; it's their leaving us at dusk.\nI never bore it well when people went.\nThe first night after guests have gone the house\nSeems haunted or exposed. I always take\nA personal interest in the locking up\nAt bedtime; but the strangeness soon wears off.\"\nHe fetched a dingy lantern from behind\nA door. \"There's that we didn't lose!

cloud\nDarkly advanced with a perpetual dagger\nFlickering across its bosom.

One stayed.\nThe town-bred farmer failed to understand.\n\n\"What was there wrong?\"\n\n\"Something you just now said.\"\n\n\"What did I say?\"\n\n\"About our taking pains.\n\n\"To cock the hay?\u2014-because it's going to shower?\nI said that more than half an hour ago.\nI said it to myself as much as you.\"\n\n\"You didn't know.

You've found out\nsomething.\nThe hand that knows his business won't be told\nTo do work better or faster\u2014-those two things.\nI'm as particular as anyone:\nMost likely I'd have served you just the same.\nBut I know you don't understand our ways.\nYou were just talking what was in your mind\nWhat was in all our minds and you weren't hinting.\n\nTell you a story of what happened once:\nI was up here in Salem at a man's\nNamed Sanders with a gang of four or five\nDoing the haying. No one liked the boss.\nHe was one of the kind sports call a spider\nAll wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy\nFrom a humped body nigh as big's a biscuit.\nBut work! that man could work especially\nIf by so doing he could get more work\nOut of his hired help. I'm not denying\nHe was hard on himself. I couldn't find\nThat he kept any hours\u2014-not for himself.\nDaylight and lantern-light were one to him:\nI've heard him pounding in the barn all night.\nBut what he liked was someone to encourage.\nThem that he couldn't lead he'd get behind\nAnd drive the way you can you know in mowing\u2014-\nKeep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs\noff.\nI'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks\n(We call that bulling). I'd been watching him.\nSo when he paired off with me in the hayfield\nTo load the load thinks I Look out for trouble.\nI built the load and topped it off; old Sanders\nCombed it down with a rake and says 'O. K.'\nEverything went well till we reached the barn\nWith a big jag to empty in a bay.\nYou understand that meant the easy job\nFor the man up on top of throwing _down_\nThe hay and rolling it off wholesale\nWhere on a mow it would have been slow lifting.\nYou wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging\nUnder those circumstances would you now?\nBut the old fool seizes his fork in both hands\nAnd looking up bewhiskered out of the pit\nShouts like an army captain 'Let her come!\nThinks I D'ye mean it? 'What was that you\nsaid?'\nI asked out loud so's there'd be no mistake\n'Did you say Let her come?' 'Yes let her come.'\nHe said it over but he said it softer.\nNever you say a thing like that to a man\nNot if he values what he is. God I'd as soon\nMurdered him as left out his middle name.\nI'd built the load and knew right where to find it.\nTwo or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for\nLike meditating and then I just dug in\nAnd dumped the rackful on him in ten lots\nI looked over the side once in the dust\nAnd caught sight of him treading-water-like\nKeeping his head above. 'Damn ye' I says\n'That gets ye!' He squeaked like a squeezed rat.\nThat was the last I saw or heard of him.\nI cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off.\nAs I sat mopping hayseed from my neck\nAnd sort of waiting to be asked about it\nOne of the boys sings out 'Where's the old man?'\n'I left him in the barn under the hay.\nIf ye want him ye can go and dig him out.'\nThey realised from the way I swobbed my neck\nMore than was needed something must be up.\nThey headed for the barn; I stayed where I was.\nThey told me afterward. First they forked hay\nA lot of it out into the barn floor.\nNothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle.\nI guess they thought I'd spiked him in the temple\nBefore I buried him or I couldn't have managed.\nThey excavated more. 'Go keep his wife\nOut of the barn.' Someone looked in a window\nAnd curse me if he wasn't in the kitchen\nSlumped way down in a chair with both his feet\nStuck in the oven the hottest day that summer.\nHe looked so clean disgusted from behind\nThere was no one that dared to stir him up\nOr let him know that he was being looked at.\nApparently I hadn't buried him\n(I may have knocked him down); but my just\ntrying\nTo bury him had hurt his dignity.\nHe had gone to the house so's not to meet me.\nHe kept away from us all afternoon.\nWe tended to his hay. We saw him out\nAfter a while picking peas in his garden:\nHe couldn't keep away from doing something.\"\n\n\"Weren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead?\"\n\n\"No! and yet I don't know\u2014-it's hard to say.\nI went about to kill him fair enough.\"\n\n\"You took an awkward way. Did he discharge\nyou?\"\n\"Discharge me? No! He knew I did just right.\"", "A HUNDRED COLLARS": "Lancaster bore him\u2014-such a little town\nSuch a great man.

You ought to have seen!\"\n\n\"I don't know what part of the pasture you mean.\"\n\n\"You know where they cut off the woods\u2014-let me\nsee\u2014-\nIt was two years ago\u2014-or no!\u2014-can it be\nNo longer than that?\u2014-and the following fall\nThe fire ran and burned it all up but the wall.\"\n\n\"Why there hasn't been time for the bushes to\ngrow.\nThat's always the way with the blueberries though:\nThere may not have been the ghost of a sign\nOf them anywhere under the shade of the pine\nBut get the pine out of the way you may burn\nThe pasture all over until not a fern\nOr grass-blade is left not to mention a stick\nAnd presto they're up all around you as thick\nAnd hard to explain as a conjurer's trick.\"\n\n\"It must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit.\nI taste in them sometimes the flavour of soot.\n\nAnd after all really they're ebony skinned:\nThe blue's but a mist from the breath of the wind\nA tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand\nAnd less than the tan with which pickers are\ntanned.\"\n\n\"Does Mortenson know what he has do you\nthink?\"\n\n\"He may and not care and so leave the chewink\nTo gather them for him\u2014-you know what he is.\nHe won't make the fact that they're rightfully his\nAn excuse for keeping us other folk out.\"\n\n\"I wonder you didn't see Loren about.\"\n\n\"The best of it was that I did. Do you know\nI was just getting through what the field had to show\nAnd over the wall and into the road\nWhen who should come by with a democrat-load\nOf all the young chattering Lorens alive\nBut Loren the fatherly out for a drive.\"\n\n\"He saw you then? What did he do? Did he\nfrown?\"\n\n\"He just kept nodding his head up and down.\nYou know how politely he always goes by.\nBut he thought a big thought\u2014-I could tell by his\neye\u2014-\nWhich being expressed might be this in effect:\n'I have left those there berries I shrewdly suspect\nTo ripen too long. I am greatly to blame.'\"\n\n\"He's a thriftier person than some I could name.\"\n\n\"He seems to be thrifty; and hasn't he need\nWith the mouths of all those young Lorens to feed?\nHe has brought them all up on wild berries they\nsay\nLike birds. They store a great many away.\nThey eat them the year round and those they\ndon't eat\nThey sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet.\"\n\n\"Who cares what they say? It's a nice way to live\nJust taking what Nature is willing to give\nNot forcing her hand with harrow and plow.\"\n\n\"I wish you had seen his perpetual bow\u2014-\nAnd the air of the youngsters! Not one of them\nturned\nAnd they looked so solemn-absurdly concerned.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew half what the flock of them know\nOf where all the berries and other things grow\nCranberries in bogs and raspberries on top\nOf the boulder-strewn mountain and when they\nwill crop.\nI met them one day and each had a flower\nStuck into his berries as fresh as a shower;\nSome strange kind\u2014-they told me it hadn't a name.\"\n\n\"I've told you how once not long after we came\nI almost provoked poor Loren to mirth\nBy going to him of all people on earth\nTo ask if he knew any fruit to be had\nFor the picking. The rascal he said he'd be glad\nTo tell if he knew. But the year had been bad.\nThere _had_ been some berries\u2014-but those were all\ngone.\nHe didn't say where they had been. He went on:\n'I'm sure\u2014-I'm sure'-\u2014as polite as could be.\nHe spoke to his wife in the door 'Let me see\nMarne _we_ don't know any good berrying place?'\nIt was all he could do to keep a straight face.\"\n\n\"If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him\nHe'll find he's mistaken. See here for a whim\nWe'll pick in the Mortensons' pasture this year.\nWe'll go in the morning that is if it's clear\nAnd the sun shines out warm: the vines must be\nwet.\nIt's so long since I picked I almost forget\nHow we used to pick berries: we took one look\nround\nThen sank out of sight like trolls underground\nAnd saw nothing more of each other or heard\nUnless when you said I was keeping a bird\nAway from its nest and I said it was you.\n'Well one of us is.' For complaining it flew\nAround and around us. And then for a while\nWe picked till I feared you had wandered a mile\nAnd I thought I had lost you. I lifted a shout\nToo loud for the distance you were it turned out\nFor when you made answer your voice was as low\nAs talking\u2014-you stood up beside me you know.\"\n\n\"We shan't have the place to ourselves to enjoy\u2014-\nNot likely when all the young Lorens deploy.\nThey'll be there to-morrow or even to-night.\nThey won't be too friendly\u2014-they may be polite\u2014-\nTo people they look on as having no right\nTo pick where they're picking. But we won't\ncomplain.\nYou ought to have seen how it looked in the rain\nThe fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves\nLike two kinds of jewels a vision for thieves.\"\n\n\n\n\nBROWN'S DESCENT OR THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE\n\n\nBrown lived at such a lofty farm\nThat everyone for miles could see\nHis lantern when he did his chores\nIn winter after half-past three.\n\nAnd many must have seen him make\nHis wild descent from there one night\n'Cross lots 'cross walls 'cross everything\nDescribing rings of lantern light.\n\nBetween the house and barn the gale\nGot him by something he had on\nAnd blew him out on the icy crust\nThat cased the world and he was gone!\n\nWalls were all buried trees were few:\nHe saw no stay unless he stove\nA hole in somewhere with his heel.\nBut though repeatedly he strove\n\nAnd stamped and said things to himself\nAnd sometimes something seemed to yield\nHe gained no foothold but pursued\nHis journey down from field to field.\n\nSometimes he came with arms outspread\nLike wings revolving in the scene\nUpon his longer axis and\nWith no small dignity of mien.\n\nFaster or slower as he chanced\nSitting or standing as he chose\nAccording as he feared to risk\nHis neck or thought to spare his clothes\n\nHe never let the lantern drop.\nAnd some exclaimed who saw afar\nThe figures he described with it\n\"I wonder what those signals are\n\nBrown makes at such an hour of night!\nHe's celebrating something strange.\nI wonder if he's sold his farm\nOr been made Master of the Grange.\"\n\nHe reeled he lurched he bobbed he checked;\nHe fell and made the lantern rattle\n(But saved the light from going out).\nSo half-way down he fought the battle\n\nIncredulous of his own bad luck.\nAnd then becoming reconciled\nTo everything he gave it up\nAnd came down like a coasting child.\n\n\"Well\u2014-I-\u2014be----\" that was all he said\nAs standing in the river road\nHe looked back up the slippery slope\n(Two miles it was) to his abode.\n\nSometimes as an authority\nOn motor-cars I'm asked if I\nShould say our stock was petered out\nAnd this is my sincere reply:\n\nYankees are what they always were.\nDon't think Brown ever gave up hope\nOf getting home again because\nHe couldn't climb that slippery slope;\n\nOr even thought of standing there\nUntil the January thaw\nShould take the polish off the crust.\nHe bowed with grace to natural law\n\nAnd then went round it on his feet\nAfter the manner of our stock;\nNot much concerned for those to whom\nAt that particular time o'clock\n\nIt must have looked as if the course\nHe steered was really straight away\nFrom that which he was headed for\u2014-\nNot much concerned for them I say.\n\nBut now he snapped his eyes three times;\nThen shook his lantern saying \"Ile's\n'Bout out!\" and took the long way home\nBy road a matter of several miles.", "REVELATION": "We make ourselves a place apart\nBehind light words that tease and flout\nBut oh the agitated heart\nTill someone really find us out.\n\nA pity if the case require\n(Or so we say) that in the end\nWe speak the literal to inspire\nThe understanding of a friend.\n\nBut so with all from babes that play\nAt hide-and-seek to God afar\nSo all who hide too well away\nMust speak and tell us where they are.", "STORM-FEAR": "When the wind works against us in the dark\nAnd pelts with snow\nThe lower chamber window on the east\nAnd whispers with a sort of stifled bark\nThe beast\n\"Come out!
