*** Robert Hayden (1913 - 1980)

1. THE PRISONERS

	Steel doors--guillotine gates--
	of the doorless house closed massively.
	We were locked in with loss.
	
	Guards frisked us, marked our wrists,
	then let us into the drab Rec Hall--
	splotched green walls, high windows barred--
	
	where the dispossessed awaited us.
	Hands intimate with knife and pistol,
	hands that had cruelly grasped and throttled
	
	clasped ours in welcome. I sensed the plea
	of men denied: Believe us human
	like yourselves, who but for Grace . . .
	
	We shared reprieving Hidden Words
	revealed by the Godlike imprisoned
	One, whose crime was truth.
	
	And I read poems I hoped were true.
	It’s like you been there, brother, been there,
	the scarred young lifer said.



2. THOSE WINTER SUNDAYS

	Sundays too my father got up early
	And put his clothes on in the blueback cold,
	then with cracked hands that ached
	from labor in the weekday weather made
	banked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.
	
	I’d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.
	When the rooms were warm, he’d call,
	and slowly I would rise and dress,
	fearing the chronic angers of that house,
	
	Speaking indifferently to him,
	who had driven out the cold
	and polished my good shoes as well.
	What did I know, what did I know
	of love’s austere and lonely offices?
