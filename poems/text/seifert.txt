*** Jaroslav Seifert (1901 - 1986)

1. FRAGMENT OF A LETTER

	All night rain lashed the windows.
	I couldn’t go to sleep.
	So I switched on the light
	and wrote a letter.
	
	If love could fly,
	as of course it can’t,
	and didn’t so often stay close to the ground,
	it would be delightful to be enveloped
	in its breeze.
	
	But like infuriated bees
	jealous kisses swarm down upon
	the sweetness of the female body
	and an impatient hand grasps
	whatever it can reach,
	and desire does not flag.
	Even death might be without terror
	at the moment of exultation.
	
	But who has ever calculated
	how much love goes
	into one pair of open arms!
	
	Letters to women
	I always sent by pigeon post.
	My conscience is clear.
	I never entrusted them to sparrowhawks
	or goshawks.
	
	Under my pen the verses dance no longer
	and like a tear in the corner of an eye
	the word hangs back.
	And all my life, at its end,
	is now only a fast journey on a train:
	
	I’m standing by the window of the carriage
	and day after day
	speeds back into yesterday
	to join the black mists of sorrow.
	At times I helplessly catch hold
	of the emergency brake.
	
	Perhaps I shall once more catch sight
	of a woman’s smile,
	trapped like a torn-off flower
	on the lashes of her eyes.
	Perhaps I may still be allowed
	to send those eyes at least one kiss
	before they’re lost to me in the dark.
	
	Perhaps once more I shall even see
	a slender ankle
	chiselled like a gem
	out of warm tenderness,
	so that I might once more
	half choke with longing.
	
	How much is there that man must leave behind
	as the train inexorably approaches
	Lethe Station
	with its plantations of shimmering asphodels
	amidst whose perfume everything is forgotten.
	Including human love.
	
	That is the final stop:
	the train goes no further.



2. A SONG AT THE END

	Listen: about little Hendele.
	She came back to me yesterday
	and she was twenty-four already.
	And as graceful as Shulamite.
	
	She wore an ash-gray squirrel fur
	and a pert little cap
	and round her neck she’d tied a scarf
	the colour of pale smoke.
	
	Hendele, how well this suits you!
	I thought that you were dead
	and meanwhile you have grown more beautiful.
	I am glad you’ve come!
	
	How wrong you are, dear friend!
	I’ve been dead twenty years,
	and very well you know it.
	I’ve only come to meet you.



3. STRUGGLE WITH THE ANGEL

	God knows who first thought up
	that gloomy image
	and spoke of the dead
	as living shades
	straying about amongst us.
	
	And yet those shades are really here--
	you can’t miss them.
	Over the years I’ve gathered around me
	a numerous cluster.
	But it is I amidst them all
	who is straying.
	
	They’re dark
	and their muteness keeps time
	with my muteness
	when the evening’s closing in
	and I’m alone.
	Now and again they stay my writing hand
	when I’m not right,
	and blow away an evil thought
	that’s painful.
	
	Some of them are so dim
	and faded
	I’m losing sight of them in the distance.
	One of the shades, however, is rose-red
	and weeps.
	In every person’s life
	there comes a moment
	when everything suddenly goes black before his eyes
	and he longs passionately to take in his hands
	a smiling head.
	His heart wants to be tied
	to another heart,
	even by deep stitches,
	while his lips desire nothing more
	than to touch down on the spots where
	the midnight raven settled on Pallas Athene
	when uninvited it flew in to visit
	a melancholy poet.
	
	It is called love.
	All right,
	perhaps that’s what it is!
	But only rarely does it last for long,
	let alone unto death
	as in the case of swans.
	Often loves succeed each other
	like suits of cards in your hand.
	
	Sometimes it’s just a tremor of delight,
	more often long and bitter pain.
	At other times all sighs and tears.
	And sometimes even boredom.
	That’s the saddest kind.
	
	Some time in the past I saw a rose-red shade.
	It stood by the entrance to a house
	facing Prague’s railway station,
	eternally swathed in smoke.
	
	We used to sit there by the window.
	I held her delicate hands
	and talked of love.
	I’m good at that!
	She’s long been dead.
	The red lights were winking
	down by the track.
	
	As soon as the wind sprang up a little
	it blew away the grey veil
	and the rails glistened
	like the strings of some monstrous piano.
	At times you could also hear the whistle of steam
	and the puffing of engines
	as they carried off people’s wretched longings
	from the grimy platforms
	to all possible destinations.
	Sometimes they also carried away the dead
	returning to their homes
	and to their cemeteries.
	
	Now I know why it hurts so
	to tear hand from hand,
	lips from lips,
	when the stitches tear
	and the guard slams shut
	the last carriage door.
	
	Love’s an eternal struggle with the angel.
	From dawn to night.
	Without mercy.
	The opponent is often stronger.
	But woe to him
	who doesn’t realize
	that his angel has no wings
	and will not bless.
