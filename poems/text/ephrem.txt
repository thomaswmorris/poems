*** Ephrem the Syrian (306 - 373)

1. HYMN TO THE LIGHT

	The Light of the just and joy of the upright is Christ Jesus our Lord.
	Begotten of the Father, He manifested himself to us.
	He came to rescue us from darkness and to fill us with the radiance of His light.
	Day is dawning upon us; the power of darkness is fading away.
	
	From the true Light there arises for us the light which illumines our darkened eyes.
	His glory shines upon the world and enlightens the very depths of the abyss.
	Death is annihilated, night has vanished, and the gates of Sheol are broken.
	Creatures lying in darkness from ancient times are clothed in light.
	The dead arise from the dust and sing because they have a Savior.
	He brings salvation and grants us life. He ascends to his Father on high.
	He will return in glorious splendor and shed His light on those gazing upon Him.
	
	Our King comes in majestic glory.
	
	Let us light our lamps and go forth to meet Him.
	Let us find our joy in Him, for He has found joy in us.
	He will indeed rejoice us with His marvelous light.
	
	Let us glorify the majesty of the Son and give thanks to the almighty Father
	Who, in an outpouring of love, sent Him to us, to fill us with hope and salvation.
	When He manifests Himself, the saints awaiting Him in weariness and sorrow,
	will go forth to meet Him with lighted lamps.
	
	The angels and guardians of heaven will rejoice
	in the glory of the just and upright people of earth;
	Together crowned with victory,
	they will sing hymns and psalms.
	
	Stand up then and be ready!
	Give thanks to our King and Savior,
	Who will come in great glory to gladden us
	with His marvelous light in His kingdom.
