*** Dorothy Parker (1893 - 1967)

1. A DREAM LIES DEAD

	A dream lies dead here. May you softly go 
	Before this place, and turn away your eyes, 
	Nor seek to know the look of that which dies 
	Importuning Life for life. Walk not in woe, 
	But, for a little, let your step be slow.  
	And, of your mercy, be not sweetly wise 
	With words of hope and Spring and tenderer skies. 
	A dream lies dead; and this all mourners know:  
	
	Whenever one drifted petal leaves the tree--
	Though white of bloom as  it had been before 
	And proudly waitful of fecundity--
	One little loveliness can be no more; 
	And so must Beauty bow her imperfect head  
	Because a dream has joined the wistful dead!



2. INTERIOR

	Her mind lives in a quiet room,
	A narrow room, and tall,
	With pretty lamps to quench the gloom
	And mottoes on the wall.
	
	Her mind lives tidily, apart
	From cold and noise and pain,
	And bolts the door against her heart,
	Out wailing in the rain.



3. THE RED DRESS

	I always saw, I always said
	If I were grown and free,
	I’d have a gown of reddest red
	As fine as you could see,
	
	To wear out walking, sleek and slow,
	Upon a Summer day,
	And there’d be one to see me so
	And flip the world away.
	
	And he would be a gallant one,
	With stars behind his eyes,
	And hair like metal in the sun,
	And lips too warm for lies.
	
	I always saw us, gay and good,
	High honored in the town.
	Now I am grown to womanhood . . .
	I have the silly gown.



4. SYMPTOM RECITAL

	I do not like my state of mind;
	I’m bitter, querulous, unkind.
	I hate my legs, I hate my hands,
	I do not yearn for lovelier lands.
	I dread the dawn’s recurrent light;
	I hate to go to bed at night.
	I snoot at simple, earnest folk.
	I cannot take the gentlest joke.
	I find no peace in paint or type.
	My world is but a lot of tripe.
	I’m disillusioned, empty-breasted.
	For what I think, I’d be arrested.
	I am not sick, I am not well.
	My quondam dreams are shot to hell.
	My soul is crushed, my spirit sore;
	I do not like me any more.
	I cavil, quarrel, grumble, grouse.
	I ponder on the narrow house.
	I shudder at the thought of men . . .
	I’m due to fall in love again.
