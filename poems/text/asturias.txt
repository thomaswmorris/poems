*** Miguel Ángel Asturias (1899 - 1974)

1. CAUDAL

	To give is to love,
	To give prodigiously:
	For every drop of water
	To return a torrent.
	
	We were made that way,
	Made to scatter
	Seeds in the furrow
	And stars in the ocean.
	
	Woe to him, Lord,
	who doesn’t exhaust his supply,
	And, on returning, tells you:
	“Like an empty satchel
	Is my heart.”
