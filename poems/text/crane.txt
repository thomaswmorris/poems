*** Hart Crane (1899 - 1932)

1. FORGETFULNESS

	Forgetfulness is like a song
	That, freed from beat and measure, wanders.
	Forgetfulness is like a bird whose wings are reconciled,
	Outspread and motionless,--
	A bird that coasts the wind unwearyingly.
	
	Forgetfulness is rain at night,
	Or an old house in a forest,--or a child.
	Forgetfulness is white,--white as a blasted tree,
	And it may stun the sybil into prophecy,
	Or bury the Gods.
	
	I can remember much forgetfulness.



2. LEGEND

	As silent as a mirror is believed
	Realities plunge in silence by . . .
	
	I am not ready for repentance;
	Nor to match regrets. For the moth
	Bends no more than the still
	Imploring flame. And tremorous
	In the white falling flakes
	Kisses are,--
	The only worth all granting.
	
	It is to be learned--
	This cleaving and this burning,
	But only by the one who
	Spends out himself again.
	
	Twice and twice
	(Again the smoking souvenir,
	Bleeding eidolon!) and yet again.
	Until the bright logic is won
	Unwhispering as a mirror
	Is believed.
	
	Then, drop by caustic drop, a perfect cry
	Shall string some constant harmony,--
	Relentless caper for all those who step
	The legend of their youth into the noon.



3. MY GRANDMOTHER’S LOVE LETTERS

	There are no stars to-night
	But those of memory.
	Yet how much room for memory there is
	In the loose girdle of soft rain.
	
	There is even room enough
	For the letters of my mother’s mother,
	Elizabeth,
	That have been pressed so long
	Into a corner of the roof
	That they are brown and soft,
	And liable to melt as snow.
	
	Over the greatness of such space
	Steps must be gentle.
	It is all hung by an invisible white hair.
	It trembles as birch limbs webbing the air.
	
	And I ask myself:
	
	“Are your fingers long enough to play
	Old keys that are but echoes:
	Is the silence strong enough
	To carry back the music to its source
	And back to you again
	As though to her?”
	
	Yet I would lead my grandmother by the hand
	Through much of what she would not understand;
	And so I stumble. And the rain continues on the roof
	With such a sound of gently pitying laughter.



4. NORTH LABRADOR

	A land of leaning ice
	Hugged by plaster-grey arches of sky,
	Flings itself silently
	Into eternity.
	
	“Has no one come here to win you,
	Or left you with the faintest blush
	Upon your glittering breasts?
	Have you no memories, O Darkly Bright?”
	
	Cold-hushed, there is only the shifting moments
	That journey toward no Spring--
	No birth, no death, no time nor sun
	In answer.



5. PASSAGE

	Where the cedar leaf divides the sky
	I heard the sea.
	In sapphire arenas of the hills
	I was promised an improved infancy.
	
	Sulking, sanctioning the sun,
	My memory I left in a ravine,--
	Casual louse that tissues the buck-wheat,
	Aprons rocks, congregates pears
	In moonlit bushels
	And wakens alleys with a hidden cough.
	
	Dangerously the summer burned
	(I had joined the entrainments of the wind).
	The shadows of boulders lengthened my back:
	In the bronze gongs of my cheeks
	The rain dried without odour.
	
	“It is not long, it is not long;
	See where the red and black
	Vine-stanchioned valleys--“: but the wind
	Died speaking through the ages that you know
	And bug, chimney-sooted heart of man!
	So was I turned about and back, much as your smoke
	Compiles a too well-known biography.
	
	The evening was a spear in the ravine
	That throve through very oak. And had I walked
	The dozen particular decimals of time?
	Touching an opening laurel, I found
	A thief beneath, my stolen book in hand.
	
	“Why are you back here--smiling an iron coffin?
	“To argue with the laurel,” I replied:
	“Am justified in transience, fleeing
	Under the constant wonder of your eyes”
	
	He closed the book. And from the Ptolemies
	Sand troughed us in a glittering, abyss.
	A serpent swam a vertex to the sun
	--On unpaced beaches leaned its tongue and
	drummed.
	What fountains did I hear? What icy speeches?
	Memory, committed to the page, had broke.
