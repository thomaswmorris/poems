*** Emily Dickinson (1830 - 1886)

1. THE BLUE JAY

	No brigadier throughout the year
	So civic as the jay.
	A neighbor and a warrior too
	With shrill felicity
	
	Pursuing winds that censure us
	A February day
	The brother of the universe
	Was never blown away.
	
	The snow and he are intimate;
	I ‘ve often seen them play
	When heaven looked upon us all
	With such severity
	
	I felt apology were due
	To an insulted sky
	Whose pompous frown was nutriment
	To their temerity.
	
	The pillow of this daring head
	Is pungent evergreens;
	His larder--terse and militant--
	Unknown refreshing things;
	
	His character a tonic
	His future a dispute;
	Unfair an immortality
	That leaves this neighbor out.



2. DEATH

	Because I could not stop for Death--
	He kindly stopped for me--
	The Carriage held but just Ourselves--
	And Immortality.
	
	We slowly drove--He knew no haste
	And I had put away
	My labor and my leisure too,
	For His Civility--
	
	We passed the School, where Children strove
	At Recess--in the Ring--
	We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain--
	We passed the Setting Sun--
	
	Or rather--He passed Us--
	The Dews drew quivering and Chill--
	For only Gossamer, my Gown--
	My Tippet--only Tulle--
	
	We paused before a House that seemed
	A Swelling of the Ground--
	The Roof was scarcely visible--
	The Cornice--in the Ground--
	
	Since then--‘tis Centuries--and yet
	Feels shorter than the Day
	I first surmised the Horses’ Heads
	Were toward Eternity--



3. EXCLUSION

	The soul selects her own society
	Then shuts the door;
	On her divine majority
	Obtrude no more.
	
	Unmoved she notes the chariot’s pausing
	At her low gate;
	Unmoved an emperor is kneeling
	Upon her mat.
	
	I’ve known her from an ample nation
	Choose one;
	Then close the valves of her attention
	Like stone.



4. FUNERAL

	I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
	And Mourners to and fro
	Kept treading--treading--till it seemed
	That Sense was breaking through--
	
	And when they all were seated,
	A Service, like a Drum--
	Kept beating--beating--till I thought
	My mind was going numb--
	
	And then I heard them lift a Box
	And creak across my Soul
	With those same Boots of Lead, again,
	Then Space--began to toll,
	
	As all the Heavens were a Bell,
	And Being, but an Ear,
	And I, and Silence, some strange Race,
	Wrecked, solitary, here--
	
	And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
	And I dropped down, and down--
	And hit a World, at every plunge,
	And Finished knowing--then--



5. HOPE

	Hope is the thing with feathers
	That perches in the soul
	And sings the tune without the words
	And never stops at all
	
	And sweetest in the gale is heard;
	And sore must be the storm
	That could abash the little bird
	That kept so many warm.
	
	I’ve heard it in the chillest land
	And on the strangest sea;
	Yet never in extremity
	It asked a crumb of me.



6. HUNGER

	I had been hungry all the years;
	My noon had come to dine;
	I trembling drew the table near
	And touched the curious wine.
	
	‘T was this on tables I had seen
	When turning hungry lone
	I looked in windows for the wealth
	I could not hope to own.
	
	I did not know the ample bread
	‘T was so unlike the crumb
	The birds and I had often shared
	In Nature’s dining-room.
	
	The plenty hurt me ‘t was so new--
	Myself felt ill and odd
	As berry of a mountain bush
	Transplanted to the road.
	
	Nor was I hungry; so I found
	That hunger was a way
	Of persons outside windows
	The entering takes away.



7. NOBODY

	I’m Nobody! Who are you?
	Are you--Nobody--too?
	Then there’s a pair of us!
	Don’t tell! they’d advertise--you know!
	
	How dreary--to be--Somebody!
	How public--like a Frog--
	To tell one’s name--the livelong June--
	To an admiring Bog!



8. THE SEA

	An everywhere of silver
	With ropes of sand
	To keep it from effacing
	The track called land.



9. SUCCESS

	Success is counted sweetest
	By those who ne’er succeed.
	To comprehend a nectar
	Requires sorest need.
	
	Not one of all the purple Host
	Who took the Flag today
	Can tell the definition
	So clear of victory
	
	As he defeated--dying--
	On whose forbidden ear
	The distant strains of triumph
	Burst agonized and clear!



10. TRUTH

	Tell all the truth but tell it slant--
	Success in Circuit lies
	Too bright for our infirm Delight
	The Truth’s superb surprise
	As Lightning to the Children eased
	With explanation kind
	The Truth must dazzle gradually
	Or every man be blind--



11. WILD NIGHTS

	Wild nights--Wild nights!
	Were I with thee
	Wild nights should be
	Our luxury!
	
	Futile--the winds--
	To a Heart in port--
	Done with the Compass--
	Done with the Chart!
	
	Rowing in Eden--
	Ah--the Sea!
	Might I but moor--tonight--
	In thee!
