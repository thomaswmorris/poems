*** Paul Verlaine (1844 - 1896)

1. INNOCENTS WE

	Their long skirts and high heels battled away:
	Depending on the ground’s and breezes’ whim,
	At times some stocking shone, low on the limb--
	Too soon concealed!--tickling our naïveté.
	
	At times, as well, an envious bug would bite
	Our lovelies’ necks beneath the boughs, and we
	Would glimpse a flash—white flash, ah! ecstasy!--
	And glut our mad young eyes on sheer delight.
	
	Evening would fall, the autumn day would draw
	To its uncertain close: our belles would cling
	Dreamingly to us, cooing, whispering
	Lies that still set our souls trembling with awe.



2. MON RÊVE FAMILIER

	Oft do I dream this strange and penetrating dream:
	An unknown woman, whom I love, who loves me well,
	Who does not every time quite change, nor yet quite dwell
	The same,--and loves me well, and knows me as I am.
	
	For she knows me! My heart, clear as a crystal beam
	To her alone, ceases to be inscrutable
	To her alone, and she alone knows to dispel
	My grief, cooling my brow with her tears’ gentle stream.
	
	Is she of favor dark or fair?--I do not know.
	Her name? All I remember is that it doth flow
	Softly, as do the names of them we loved and lost.
	
	Her eyes are like the statues’,--mild and grave and wide;
	And for her voice she has as if it were the ghost
	Of other voices,--well-loved voices that have died.



3. THE SKY-BLUE SMILES ABOVE THE ROOF

	The sky-blue smiles above the roof
	      Its tenderest;
	A green tree rears above the roof
	      Its waving crest.
	
	The church-bell in the windless sky
	      Peaceably rings,
	A skylark soaring in the sky
	      Endlessly sings.
	
	My God, my God, all life is there,
	      Simple and sweet;
	The soothing bee-hive murmur there
	      Comes from the street!
	
	What have you done, O you that weep
	      In the glad sun,--
	Say, with your youth, you man that weep,
	      What have you done?
