1. CHRISTIAN EVIDENCES

	Now God forbid that Faith be blind assent,
	 Grasping what others know; else Faith were nought
	But learning, as of some far continent
	       Which others sought,
	And carried thence, better the tale to teach,
	Pebbles and shells, poor fragments of the beach.
	
	Now God forbid that Faith be built on dates,
	 Cursive or uncial letters, scribe or gloss,
	What one conjectures, proves, or demonstrates:
	       This were the loss
	Of all to which God bids that man aspire,
	This were the death of life, quenching of fire.
	
	Nay, but with Faith I see. Not even Hope,
	 Her glorious sister, stands so high as she.
	For this but stands expectant on the slope
	       That leads where He
	Her source and consummation sets His seat,
	Where Faith dwells always to caress His Feet.
	
	Nay, but with Faith I saw my Lord and God
	 Walk in the fragrant garden yesterday.
	Ah! how the thrushes sang; and, where He trod
	       Like spikenard lay
	Jewels of dew, fresh-fallen from the sky,
	While all the lawn rang round with melody.
	
	Nay, but with Faith I marked my Saviour go,
	 One August noonday, down the stifling street
	That reeked with filth and man; marked from Him flow
	       Radiance so sweet,
	The man ceased cursing, laughter lit the child,
	The woman hoped again, as Jesus smiled.
	
	Nay, but with Faith I sought my Lord last night,
	 And found Him shining where the lamp was dim;
	The shadowy altar glimmered, height on height,
	       A throne for Him:
	Seen as through lattice work His gracious Face
	Looked forth on me and filled the dark with grace.
	
	Nay then, if proof and tortured argument
	 Content thee -- teach thee that the Lord is there,
	Or risen again; I pray thee be content,
	       But leave me here
	With eye unsealed by any proof of thine,
	With eye unsealed to know the Lord is mine.
	
	Prove if thou wilt, my friend, that Paul is Paul
	 And Peter Peter: talk till crack of doom;
	Marshal thy facts ; yes, yes, l know them all;
	       And, spite of gloom,
	Of all the dust and science raised by thee,
	I saw my Lord was there Who smiled on me.
	
	Thou dost believe that, ah, so long ago
	 He lived, wrought marvels, and was crucified,
	Because that Holy Matthew tells thee so?
	       I, on my side,
	Know Him as Love; and Love could not pass by
	And leave men sinning -- therefore Love must die.
	
	Thou dost believe, because He rose again,
	 That Christ is very God? Yet I believe
	He rose because I see Him walk with men,
	       Sinners receive,
	Loose stammering tongues, open the blindest eyes.
	And none but God doth so; and God must rise.
	
	“Nay, but I serve Him,” is thy claim, “for yet
	 The faith of some rests all on evidence.
	Men will remember me, while they forget
	       Thine eloquence,
	And set it by for solid argument;
	Let me serve such, and I am well content.”
	
	Each to his own: yet surely I have read
	 How of two sisters (each to Him was dear),
	One listened but to what the Saviour said, --
	       Thought to be near
	The Lord Himself were best: -- the other ran
	Laid plates, clashed dishes, filled and set the can;
	
	And all to serve Him. Yet the Lord preferred
	 A quiet face, and that turned up to read
	The reason of His silence or His word;
	       And said indeed
	Somewhat, I fancy, of a better part
	Near to His Feet, but nearer to His Heart.
	
	Choose thou, then, Martha, if thou wilt; perchance
	 The joy of serving is enough for thee.
	Let me choose Mary; yea, love’s arrogance
	       Is all for me:
	Nay, more than Mary -- let me seek His side
	And sit by Him in penitential pride.



2. A HALT

	Lie still, my soul, the Sun of Grace
	Is warm within this garden space
	Beneath tall kindly trees.
	The quiet light is green and fair;
	A fragrance fills the swooning air;
	Lie still, and take thine ease.
	
	This silent noon of Jesu’s love
	Is warm about thee and above--
	A tender Lord is He.
	Lie still an hour--this place is His.
	He has a thousand pleasaunces,
	And each all fair and fragrant is,
	And each is all for thee.
	
	Then, Jesu, for a little space
	I rest me in this garden place,
	All sweet to scent and sight.
	Here, from this high-road scarce withdrawn,
	I thrust my hot hands in the lawn
	Cool yet with dew of far-off dawn
	And saturate with light.
	
	But ah, dear Saviour, human-wise,
	I yearn to pierce all mysteries,
	To catch Thine Hands, and see Thine Eyes
	When evening sounds begin.
	There, in Thy white Robe, Thou wilt wait
	At dusk beside some orchard gate,
	And smile to see me come so late,
	And, smiling, call me in.



3. AN INVITATION

	Lord take Thine ease within my heart,
	Rest here and count Thyself at home
	Do as Thou wilt; rise, set, depart;
	My Master, not my guest, Thou art
	Come as Thou wilt, but come, Lord, come.
	
	Do Thine own pleasure. Surely, Lord,
	Thou art full free to come and go,
	To lift my sorrow by a word,
	Or pierce me with a sudden sword,
	And leave me sobbing in my woe.
	
	Come in broad day, for good or ill,
	In time of business or of prayer;
	Come in disguise, if so Thy Will
	Be better served, that I may still
	Wait on my Lord, though unaware.
	
	Come with the dawn, shine in on me
	And wake my soul with welcome light;
	Or let the twilight herald Thee,
	And falling dusk Thy shelter be
	To shroud Thy coming from my sight.
	
	Come by the way beneath the trees
	Where whispering heath and bracken stir
	There, where my spirit takes her ease,
	Let that pure scented evening breeze
	Waft me the aloes and the myrrh.
	
	Come, tender Lover, still and bright;
	Rose crowned and framed in gracious form
	Or come with terror, and by night,
	Thundrous and girt with vivid light,
	A giant striding with the storm.
	
	Come through the Cloister, past the lawn
	And laurels where the thin jet plays
	Where, from the wrangling world withdrawn,
	Waking to silence dawn by dawn,
	My soul comes forth to studious days.
	
	Come through the carven door, and bring
	A burst of Music through to me;
	One chord of organ-thundering
	And measured song of those that sing,
	Dear Saviour, to the praise of Thee.
	
	Or come by some forgotten way
	Untrodden long and overgrown;
	And on a sudden on a day
	Burst in; snap web and ivy spray
	That claim the entrance for their own.
	
	So many doors, and all divine,
	And every latch is loose to Thee;
	So many paths, and all are Thine
	That bring Thee to this heart of mine,
	And all are therefore dear to me!



4. LAUDA SION SALVATOREM

	Laud, O Sion, thy Salvation,
	Laud in songs of exultation
	This thy Shepherd and thy King:
	All thy might in triumph raising
	Praise Him who surpasses praising,
	Far beyond thine honouring.
	
	Be our theme of high thanksgiving
	Living Bread and source of living
	Set to-day before us here
	Broken at that Supper blessed,
	As by every mouth confessed,
	For the brethren gathered there.
	
	Laud be lifted, sweet and sounding,
	Ringing from an heart abounding,
	Rising into jubilee
	Laud in duteous celebration
	Of this Table’s consecration
	For such high solemnity.
	
	Lo, the King His Law revises;
	Newer truth from elder rises,
	Newer Law and Paschal rite.
	Ancient truths their room surrender,
	Glows the twilight into splendour,
	Darkness vanishes in light.
	
	That He wrought at supper lying
	In remembrance of His dying
	Christ hath bid His Church renew;
	We the ordinance obeying,
	Earthly bread and wine displaying,
	Consecrate the Victim due.
	
	Now the sacred truth receiving
	We, the Bread His Flesh believing
	And the Wine His Blood to be,
	What tho’ eye and mind be failing,
	Nature’s order countervailing
	Grasp by faith the mystery.
	
	Under diverse kinds concealed
	While to sense yet unrevealed
	Lies a wonder all-divine
	Flesh and Blood hath each its token
	Yet abides their Christ unbroken
	Hidden under either sign.
	
	Perfect to the priest who breaks it,
	Perfect in the hand that takes it,
	Christ is undivided there,
	One or thousands may receive Him
	Yet true hearts in truth believe Him
	Unconsumed everywhere.
	
	Good and bad alike partaking
	Each, by diverse lot, is making
	One to woe and one to weal,
	Each from each is set asunder:
	Mark the word of grace and wonder--
	One to hurt and one to heal.
	
	Thus the Lord His Presence hiding
	Dwells in many parts abiding,--
	Every soul in Him confiding
	Doubts not that the Whole is there.
	He the One remaineth ever
	Under every part: for never
	Aught can Christ from Christ dissever,
	Still abiding everywhere.



5. PATIENCE

	I
	
	waited for the Lord a little space.
	So little! in whose sight as yesterday
	Passes a thousand years:--I cried for grace,
	Impatient of delay.
	
	
	II
	
	He waited for me--ah so long! For He
	Sees in one single day a loss or gain
	That bears a fruit through all eternity:--
	My soul, did He complain?



6. VISIONS OF THE NIGHT

	_Libera me a terrore nocturno a negotio
	Perambulante in tenebris . . . custodi
	animam meam O Domine visitans me 
	visitatione sanctorum revela mihi animum 
	in visionibus noctis_
	
	Ere yet I slept, the summer night
	 Lay vague and mellow in the gloom
	Beyond the steady candlelight.
	 The moth came tapping on the pane,
	   Intent on doom.
	Then sank into the night again.
	
	Then, as I lie, the darkened walls
	 Grow dim; the sheets are turned to air,
	As fold on fold the slumber falls.
	 The ticking clock grows dumb with sleep
	   And everywhere
	About the soul slow pauses creep.
	
	The sense contracts from form and space --
	 Shrinks to a speck within the brain --
	Then opens on a wider place
	 That knows no law, no harmony; 
	   Till once again
	A newer world is born for me.
	
	My spirit moves in dark dismay
	 About a house of misty halls:
	I hear the shuddering branches sway
	 At gable-corners; on the floor
	   And on the walls
	The firelight glimmers through the door.
	
	I sit and talk beside the bed,
	 Grasp hands, and meet the living eyes,
	Of one whom I had fancied dead
	 Some ten years back “How strange,” I say
	   In glad surprise,
	“That we should meet again to-day!”
	
	He smiles for answer sudden then
	 I understand the mystery
	Of dying, for the sons of men
	 And wonder where the sadness lay
	   To see him die
	Last year -- or was it yesterday?
	
	All passes; -- down long corridors,
	 That lead about this wilderness,
	Fall footsteps tramping on the floors,
	 That come from nowhere and are gone
	   Yet none the less
	I run in panting terror on.
	
	Here is a lawn with beds and grass;
	 The birds sing shrilly in the air,
	While multitudes pass and re-pass,
	 Who fill me with unknown distress,
	   That holds me there
	To mark their swift unweariedness.
	
	And so with eyes that ache to close,
	 And feet that fly and flag in turn,
	About, about, my spirit goes.
	 In wondrous wise from deep to deep,
	   Before me burn
	The crumbling pageantries of sleep.
	
	O Lord of Light, who gav’st me breath,
	 And set’st my spirit ill at ease
	Within the body of this death,
	 What means this dreaming rush and rout --
	   These phantasies
	Born from within and seen without?
	
	Since ghost and devil, foe and friend
	 Throng -- shadows on this shadow-stage --
	Move from no source and seek no end --
	 Since all the passions born of fear
	   Terror and rage,
	As in a looking-glass appear;
	
	Why com’st Thou not Thyself, O Lord,
	 To still the tossing of the brain,
	And calm with one imperious word
	 This storm of fancy under Thee,
	   And yet again
	Bid peace, as once in Galilee?
	
	Come, Lord; and if through toilsome days
	 I pray in dumb perplexity,
	And strive to lift my wearied praise, --
	 Yet let me rest when night is deep,
	   And look on Thee
	The Lord of waking and of sleep.
