*** Jack Kerouac (1922 - 1969)

1. 149TH CHORUS

	I keep falling in love
	 with my mother,
	I dont want to hurt her
	--Of all people to hurt.
	
	Every time I see her
	 she’s grown older
	But her uniform always
	 amazes me
	For its Dutch simplicity
	And the Doll she is,
	The doll-like way
	 she stands
	Bowlegged in my dreams,
	Waiting to serve me.
	
	     And I am only an Apache
	     Smoking Hashi
	     In old Cabashy
	     By the Lamp.



2. THE BOTTOMS OF MY SHOES

	The bottoms of my shoes 
	    are clean 
	From walking in the rain



3. BUS EAST

	Society has good intentions Bureaucracy is like a friend
	5 
	years ago--other furies other losses--
	
	America’s 
	trying to control the uncontrollable Forest fires, Vice
	
	The 
	essential smile In the essential sleep Of the children Of the essential mind
	
	I’m 
	all thru playing the American 
	Now I’m going to live a good quiet life
	
	The 
	world should be built for foot walkers
	
	Oily 
	rivers Of spiney Nevady
	
	I 
	am Jake Cake 
	Rake 
	Write like Blake
	
	The 
	horse is not pleased Sight of his
	gorgeous finery 
	in the dust Its silken 
	nostrils 
	did disgust
	
	Cats 
	arent kind Kiddies anent sweet
	
	April 
	in Nevada--Investigating Dismal Cheyenne Where the war parties 
	In fields 
	of straw 
	Aimed over oxen At Indian Chiefs 
	In wild headdress Pouring thru 
	the gap 
	In Wyoming plain 
	To make the settlers 
	Eat more dust than dust 
	was eaten In the States From East at Seacoast Where wagons made up To dreadful 
	Plains 
	Of clazer vup
	
	Saltry 
	settlers 
	Anxious to masturbate The Mongol Sea (I’m too tired in Cheyenne--
	No sleep in 4 nights now, & 2 to go)



4. HOW TO MEDITATE

	--lights out--
	fall, hands a-clasped, into instantaneous 
	ecstasy like a shot of heroin or morphine, 
	the gland inside of my brain discharging 
	the good glad fluid (Holy Fluid) as 
	i hap-down and hold all my body parts 
	down to a deadstop trance-Healing 
	all my sicknesses-erasing all-not 
	even the shred of a ‘I-hope-you’ or a 
	Loony Balloon left in it, but the mind 
	blank, serene, thoughtless. When a thought 
	comes a-springing from afar with its held--
	forth figure of image, you spoof it out, 
	you spuff it off, you fake it, and 
	it fades, and thought never comes-and 
	with joy you realize for the first time 
	‘thinking’s just like not thinking--
	So I don’t have to think 
	any 
	more’



5. IN VAIN

	The stars in the sky
	In vain
	The tragedy of Hamlet
	  In vain
	The key in the lock
	     In vain
	The sleeping mother
	     In vain
	The lamp in the corner
	        In vain
	The lamp in the corner unlit
	           In vain
	Abraham Lincoln
	                       In vain
	The Aztec empire
	                          In vain
	The writing hand: in vain
	(The shoetrees in the shoes
	        In vain
	The windowshade string upon
	           the hand bible
	  In vain--
	  The glitter of the greenglass
	        ashtray
	In vain
	The bear in the woods
	        In vain
	The Life of Buddha
	        In vain)



6. NEBRASKA

	April doesnt hurt here
	Like it does in New England 
	The ground
	Vast and brown 
	Surrounds dry towns 
	Located in the dust 
	Of the coming locust
	Live for survival, not for “kicks”
	Be a bangtail describer, 
	like of shrouded traveler 
	in Textile tenement & the birds fighting in yr ears-like Burroughs exact to describe & gettin $
	The Angry Hunger
	(hunger is anger) 
	 who fears the 
	 hungry feareth 
	 the angry)
	And so I came home
	To Golden far away 
	Twas on the horizon 
	Every blessed day 
	As we rolled And we rolled
	From Donner tragic Pass 
	Thru April in Nevada And out Salt City Way Into the dry Nebraskas And sad Wyomings Where young girls And pretty lover boys 
	With Mickey Mantle eyes
	Wander under moons 
	Sawing in lost cradle 
	And Judge O Fasterc 
	Passes whiggling by To ask of young love: ,,Was it the same wind Of April Plains eve that ruffled the dress
	Of my lost love
	Louanna
	In the Western
	Far off night
	    Lost as the whistle
	    Of the passing Train
	    Everywhere West
	    Roams moaning
	 The deep basso
	--Vom! Vom!
	--Was it the same love 
	Notified my bones As mortify yrs now 
	Children of the soft 
	Wyoming April night?
	 Couldna been!
	 But was! But was!”
	And on the prairie 
	The wildflower blows 
	In the night For bees & birds And sleeping hidden Animals of life.
	The Chicago
	Spitters in the spotty street 
	Cheap beans, loop, Girls made eyes at me And I had 35 Cents in my jeans--
	Then Toledo 
	Springtime starry 
	Lover night Of hot rod boys And cool girls A wandering 
	A wandering
	In search of April pain A plash of rain 
	Will not dispel This fumigatin hell Of lover lane This park of roses Blue as bees
	In former airy poses 
	In aerial O Way hoses 
	No tamarand And figancine Can the musterand Be less kind
	    Sol--
	    Sol--
	Bring forth yr Ah Sunflower--Ah me Montana 
	Phosphorescent Rose 
	And bridge in
	    fairly land
	I’d understand it all--
