{"WATER": "It was a Maine lobster town\u2014-\neach morning boatloads of hands\npushed off for granite\nquarries on the islands,\n\nand left dozens of bleak \nwhite frame houses stuck\nlike oyster shells\non a hill of rock,\n\nand below us, the sea lapped\nthe raw little match-stick \nmazes of a weir,\nwhere the fish for bait were trapped.\n\nRemember?

In the latter part of May, \nHard on our Lord\u2019s Ascension, it began \nTo be more sensible. A gentleman \nOf more than common understanding, strict \nIn morals, pious in behavior, kicked \nAgainst our goad. A man of some renown, \nAn useful, honored person in the town, \nHe came of melancholy parents; prone \nTo secret spells, for years they kept alone\u2014 \nHis uncle, I believe, was killed of it: \nGood people, but of too much or little wit. \nI preached one Sabbath on a text from Kings; \nHe showed concernment for his soul. Some things \nIn his experience were hopeful. He \nWould sit and watch the wind knocking a tree \nAnd praise this countryside our Lord has made. \nOnce when a poor man\u2019s heifer died, he laid \nA shilling on the doorsill; though a thirst \nFor loving shook him like a snake, he durst \nNot entertain much hope of his estate \nIn heaven. Once we saw him sitting late \nBehind his attic window by a light \nThat guttered on his Bible; through that night \nHe meditated terror, and he seemed \nBeyond advice or reason, for he dreamed \nThat he was called to trumpet Judgment Day \nTo Concord. In the latter part of May \nHe cut his throat. And though the coroner \nJudged him delirious, soon a noisome stir \nPalsied our village. At Jehovah\u2019s nod \nSatan seemed more let loose amongst us: God \nAbandoned us to Satan, and he pressed \nUs hard, until we thought we could not rest \nTill we had done with life. Content was gone. \nAll the good work was quashed. We were undone. \nThe breath of God had carried out a planned \nAnd sensible withdrawal from this land; \nThe multitude, once unconcerned with doubt, \nOnce neither callous, curious nor devout, \nJumped at broad noon, as though some peddler groaned \nAt it in its familiar twang: \u201cMy friend, \nCut your own throat. Cut your own throat. Now!
