{"FAREWELL AND THANKSGIVING": "Whatever I have left unsaid\nWhen I am dead\nO'muse forgive me.\nYou were always there,\nlike light, like air.\nThose great good things\nof which the least bird sings,\nSo why not I?\nYet thank you even then,\nSweet muse, Amen.", "MORNING WORSHIP": "I wake and hearing it raining.\nWere I dead, what would I give\nLazily to lie here,\nLike this, and live?\n\nOr better yet: birdsong,\nBrightening and spreading --\nHow far would I come then\nTo be at the world's wedding?\n\nNow that I lie, though,\nListening, living,\n(Oh, but not forever,\nOh, end arriving)\n\nHow shall I praise them:\nAll the sweet beings\nEternally that outlive\nMe and my dying?\n\nMountains, I mean; wind, water, air;\nGrass, and huge trees; clouds, flowers,\nAnd thunder, and night.\n\nTurtles, I mean, and toads; hawks, herons, owls;\nGraveyards, and towns, and trout; roads, gardens,\nRed berries, and deer.\n\nLightning, I mean, and eagles; fences; snow;\nSunrise, and ferns; waterfalls, serpents,\nGreen islands, and sleep.\n\nHorses, I mean; butterflies, whales;\nMosses, and stars and gravelly\nRivers, and fruit.\n\nOceans, I mean; black valleys; corn;\nBrambles, and cliffs; rock, dirt, dust, ice;\nAnd warnings of flood.\n\nHow shall I name them?\nAnd in what order?\nEach would be first.\nOmission is murder.\n\nMaidens, I mean, and apples; needles; leaves;\nWorms, and planers, and clover; whirlwinds; dew;\nBulls; geese --\n\nStop. Lie still.\nYou will never be done.\nLeave them all there.\nOld lover. Live on.", "AFTER LONG DROUGHT": "After long drought, commotion in the sky;\nAfter dead silence, thunder. Then it comes,\nThe rain. It slashes leaves, and doubly drums\nOn tin and shingle; beats and bends awry\nThe flower heads; puddles dust, and with a sigh\nLike love sinks into grasses, where it hums\nAs bees did once, among chrysanthemums\nAnd asters when the summer thought to die.\n\nThe whole world dreamed of this, and has it now.\nNor was the waking easy. The dull root\nIs jealous of its death; the sleepy brow\nSmiles in its slumber; and a heart can fear\nThe very flood it longed for, roaring near.\nThe spirit best remembers being mute.", "HE LOVES ME": "That God should love me is more wonderful\nThan that I so imperfectly love him.\nMy reason is mortality, and dim\nSenses; his--oh, insupportable--\nIs that he sees me. Even when I pull\nDark thoughts about my head, each vein and limb\nDelights him, though remembrance in him, grim\nWith my worst crimes, should prove me horrible.\n\nAnd he has terrors that he can release.\nBut when he looks he loves me; which is why\nI wonder; and my wonder must increase\nTill more of it shall slay me. Yet I live,\nI live; and he has never ceased to give\nThis glance at me that sweetens the whole sky.", "SPRING THUNDER": "Listen, The wind is still,\nAnd far away in the night--\nSee! The uplands fill\nWith a running light.\n\nOpen the doors. It is warm;\nAnd where the sky was clear--\nLook! The head of a storm\nThat marches here!\n\nCome under the trembling hedge--\nFast, although you fumble...\nThere! Did you hear the edge\nof winter crumble", "metadata": "doren|Mark Van Doren|1894|1972|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Van_Doren"}
