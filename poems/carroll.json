{"THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER": "\"The sun was shining on the sea,\n      Shining with all his might:\nHe did his very best to make\n      The billows smooth and bright--\nAnd this was odd, because it was\n      The middle of the night.\n\nThe moon was shining sulkily,\n      Because she thought the sun\nHad got no business to be there\n      After the day was done \u2014\n\"It's very rude of him,\" she said,\n      \"To come and spoil the fun.\"\n\nThe sea was wet as wet could be,\n      The sands were dry as dry.\nYou could not see a cloud, because\n      No cloud was in the sky:\nNo birds were flying overhead--\n      There were no birds to fly.\n\nThe Walrus and the Carpenter\n      Were walking close at hand;\nThey wept like anything to see\n      Such quantities of sand:\nIf this were only cleared away,'\n      They said, it would be grand!'\n\nIf seven maids with seven mops\n      Swept it for half a year,\nDo you suppose,' the Walrus said,\n      That they could get it clear?'\nI doubt it,' said the Carpenter,\n      And shed a bitter tear.\n\nO Oysters, come and walk with us!'\n      The Walrus did beseech.\nA pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,\n      Along the briny beach:\nWe cannot do with more than four,\n      To give a hand to each.'\n\nThe eldest Oyster looked at him,\n      But never a word he said:\nThe eldest Oyster winked his eye,\n      And shook his heavy head--\nMeaning to say he did not choose\n      To leave the oyster-bed.\n\nBut four young Oysters hurried up,\n      All eager for the treat:\nTheir coats were brushed, their faces washed,\n      Their shoes were clean and neat--\nAnd this was odd, because, you know,\n      They hadn't any feet.\n\nFour other Oysters followed them,\n      And yet another four;\nAnd thick and fast they came at last,\n      And more, and more, and more \u2014\nAll hopping through the frothy waves,\n      And scrambling to the shore.\n\nThe Walrus and the Carpenter\n      Walked on a mile or so,\nAnd then they rested on a rock\n      Conveniently low:\nAnd all the little Oysters stood\n      And waited in a row.\n\nThe time has come,' the Walrus said,\n      To talk of many things:\nOf shoes -- and ships -- and sealing-wax--\n      Of cabbages -- and kings--\nAnd why the sea is boiling hot--\n      And whether pigs have wings.'\n\nBut wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,\n      Before we have our chat;\nFor some of us are out of breath,\n      And all of us are fat!'\nNo hurry!' said the Carpenter.\n      They thanked him much for that.\n\nA loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,\n      Is what we chiefly need:\nPepper and vinegar besides\n      Are very good indeed--\nNow if you're ready, Oysters dear,\n      We can begin to feed.'\n\nBut not on us!' the Oysters cried,\n      Turning a little blue.\nAfter such kindness, that would be\n      A dismal thing to do!'\nThe night is fine,' the Walrus said.\n      Do you admire the view?\n\nIt was so kind of you to come!\n      And you are very nice!'\nThe Carpenter said nothing but\n      Cut us another slice:\nI wish you were not quite so deaf--\n      I've had to ask you twice!'\n\nIt seems a shame,' the Walrus said,\n      To play them such a trick,\nAfter we've brought them out so far,\n      And made them trot so quick!'\nThe Carpenter said nothing but\n      The butter's spread too thick!'\n\nI weep for you,' the Walrus said:\n      I deeply sympathize.'\nWith sobs and tears he sorted out\n      Those of the largest size,\nHolding his pocket-handkerchief\n      Before his streaming eyes.\n\nO Oysters,' said the Carpenter,\n      You've had a pleasant run!\nShall we be trotting home again?'\n      But answer came there none --\nAnd this was scarcely odd, because\n      They'd eaten every one.\"", "A BOAT BENEATH A SUNNY SKY": "A boat beneath a sunny sky,\nLingering onward dreamily\nIn an evening of July--\n\nChildren three that nestle near,\nEager eye and willing ear,\nPleased a simple tale to hear--\n\nLong has paled that sunny sky:\nEchoes fade and memories die:\nAutumn frosts have slain July.\n\nStill she haunts me, phantomwise,\nAlice moving under skies\nNever seen by waking eyes.\n\nChildren yet, the tale to hear,\nEager eye and willing ear,\nLovingly shall nestle near.\n\nIn a Wonderland they lie,\nDreaming as the days go by,\nDreaming as the summers die:\n\nEver drifting down the stream--\nLingering in the golden gleam--\nLife, what is it but a dream?", "A SEA DIRGE": "   THERE are certain things--as, a spider, a ghost,\n      The income-tax, gout, an umbrella for three--\n   That I hate, but the thing that I hate the most\n      Is a thing they call the Sea.\n\n   Pour some salt water over the floor--\n      Ugly I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll allow it to be:\n   Suppose it

_That_ would be like the Sea.\n\n   I had a vision of nursery-maids;\n      Tens of thousands passed by me--\n   All leading children with wooden spades,\n      And this was by the Sea.\n\n   Who invented those spades of wood?\n      Who was it cut them out of the tree?\n   None, I think, but an idiot could--\n      Or one that loved the Sea.\n\n   It is pleasant and dreamy, no doubt, to float\n      With \u2018thoughts as boundless, and souls as free\u2019:\n   But, suppose you are very unwell in the boat,\n      How do you like the Sea?\n\n   There is an insect that people avoid\n      (Whence is derived the verb \u2018to flee\u2019).\n   Where have you been by it most annoyed?\n      In lodgings by the Sea.\n\n   If you like your coffee with sand for dregs,\n      A decided hint of salt in your tea,\n   And a fishy taste in the very eggs--\n      By all means choose the Sea.\n\n   And if, with these dainties to drink and eat,\n      You prefer not a vestige of grass or tree,\n   And a chronic state of wet in your feet,\n      Then\u2014I recommend the Sea.\n\n   For _I_ have friends who dwell by the coast--\n      Pleasant friends they are to me!\n   It is when I am with them I wonder most\n      That anyone likes the Sea.\n\n   They take me a walk: though tired and stiff,\n      To climb the heights I madly agree;\n   And, after a tumble or so from the cliff,\n      They kindly suggest the Sea.\n\n   I try the rocks, and I think it cool\n      That they laugh with such an excess of glee,\n   As I heavily slip into every pool\n      That skirts the cold cold
