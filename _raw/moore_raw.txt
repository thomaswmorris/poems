CRITICS AND CONNOISSEURS.

There is a great amount of poetry in unconscious 
    fastidiousness.  Certain Ming 
        products, imperial floor coverings of coach- 
    wheel yellow, are well enough in their way but I have seen something 
            that I like better--a 
                mere childish attempt to make an imperfectly bal- 
                        lasted animal stand up, 
                similar determination to make a pup 
                    eat his meat from the plate.

I remember a swan under the willows of Oxford, 
    with flamingo-colored, maple- 
        leaflike feet.  It reconnoitered like a battle- 
    ship.  Disbelief and conscious fastidiousness were 
            ingredients in its 
                disinclination to move.  Finally its hardihood was 
                        not proof against its 
                proclivity to more fully appreciate such bits 
                    of food as the stream

bore counter to it; it made away with what I gave it 
    to eat.  I have seen this swan and 
        I have seen you; I have seen ambition without 
    understanding it in a variety of forms.  Happening to stand 
            by an ant-hill, I have 
                seen a fastidious ant carrying a stick north, south, 
                        east, west, till it turned on 
                itself, struck out from the flower bed into the lawn, 
                    and returned to the point

From which it had started.  Then abandoning the stick as 
    useless and overtaxing its 
        jaws with a particle of whitewash--pill-like but 
    heavy--it again went throught the same course of procedure. 
                        What is 
            there in being able 
                to say that one has dominated the stream in an attitude of 
                        self-defense; 
                in proving that one has had the experience 
                    of carrying a stick?


THE FISH.

wade
through black jade.
       Of the crow-blue mussel-shells, one keeps
       adjusting the ash-heaps;
              opening and shutting itself like

an
injured fan.
       The barnacles which encrust the side
       of the wave, cannot hide
              there for the submerged shafts of the

sun,
split like spun
       glass, move themselves with spotlight swiftness
       into the crevices—
              in and out, illuminating

the
turquoise sea
       of bodies. The water drives a wedge
       of iron through the iron edge
              of the cliff; whereupon the stars,

pink
rice-grains, ink-
       bespattered jelly fish, crabs like green
       lilies, and submarine
              toadstools, slide each on the other.

All
external
       marks of abuse are present on this
       defiant edifice—
              all the physical features of

ac-
cident—lack
       of cornice, dynamite grooves, burns, and
       hatchet strokes, these things stand
              out on it; the chasm-side is

dead.
Repeated
       evidence has proved that it can live
       on what can not revive
              its youth. The sea grows old in it.



TO A CHAMELEON.

Hid by the august foliage and fruit of the grape-vine
twine
your anatomy
round the pruned and polished stem,
Chameleon.
Fire laid upon
an emerald as long as
the Dark King's massy
one,
could not snap the spectrum up for food as you have done.


TO A STEAM ROLLER.

The illustration
is nothing to you without the application.
   You lack half wit. You crush all the particles down
      into close conformity, and then walk back and forth 
         on them.

Sparkling chips of rock
are crushed down to the level of the parent block.
   Were not 'impersonal judgment in aesthetic
      matters, a metaphysical impossibility,' you

might fairly achieve
It. As for butterflies, I can hardly conceive
   of one's attending upon you, but to question
      the congruence of the complement is vain, if it exists.



A JELLY-FISH.

Visible, invisible,
A fluctuating charm,
An amber-colored amethyst
Inhabits it; your arm
Approaches, and
It opens and
It closes;
You have meant
To catch it,
And it shrivels;
You abandon
Your intent—
It opens, and it
Closes and you
Reach for it—
The blue
Surrounding it
Grows cloudy, and
It floats away
From you.


THE MIND IS AN ENCHANTING THING.

is an enchanted thing
    like the glaze on a
katydid-wing
        subdivided by sun
        till the nettings are legion.
Like Gieseking playing Scarlatti;

like the apteryx-awl
    as a beak, or the
kiwi’s rain-shawl
        of haired feathers, the mind
        feeling its way as though blind,
walks along with its eyes on the ground.

It has memory’s ear
    that can hear without
having to hear.
        Like the gyroscope’s fall,
        truly unequivocal
because trued by regnant certainty,

it is a power of
    strong enchantment. It
is like the dove-
        neck animated by
        sun; it is memory’s eye;
it’s conscientious inconsistency.

It tears off the veil, tears
    the temptation, the
mist the heart wears,
        from its eyes—if the heart
        has a face; it takes apart
dejection. It’s fire in the dove-neck’s

iridescence; in the
    inconsistencies
of Scarlatti.
        Unconfusion submits
        its confusion to proof; it’s
not a Herod’s oath that cannot change.



NO SWAN SO FINE.

"No water so still as the 
dead fountains of Versailles." No swan, 
with swart blind look askance 
and gondoliering legs, so fine 
as the chinz china one with fawn- 
brown eyes and toothed gold 
collar on to show whose bird it was. 

Lodged in the Louis Fifteenth 
candelabrum-tree of cockscomb- 
tinted buttons, dahlias, 
sea-urchins, and everlastings, 
it perches on the branching foam 
of polished sculptured 
flowers--at ease and tall. The king is dead.



POETRY.

I too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle.
   Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers that there is in
   it after all, a place for the genuine.
      Hands that can grasp, eyes
      that can dilate, hair that can rise
         if it must, these things are important not because a

high-sounding interpretation can be put upon them but because they are
   useful; when they become so derivative as to become unintelligible, the
   same thing may be said for all of us—that we
      do not admire what
      we cannot understand. The bat,
         holding on upside down or in quest of something to

eat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless wolf under
   a tree, the immovable critic twinkling his skin like a horse that feels a flea, the base—
   ball fan, the statistician—case after case
      could be cited did
      one wish it; nor is it valid
         to discriminate against “business documents and

school-books”; all these phenomena are important. One must make a distinction
   however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not poetry,
   nor till the autocrats among us can be
     “literalists of
      the imagination”—above
         insolence and triviality and can present

for inspection, imaginary gardens with real toads in them, shall we have
   it. In the meantime, if you demand on the one hand, in defiance of their opinion—
   the raw material of poetry in
      all its rawness, and
      that which is on the other hand,
         genuine, then you are interested in poetry.



GEORGE MOORE.

In speaking of ‘aspiration,’ 
From the recesses of a pen more dolorous than blackness 
itself, 
Were you presenting us with one more form of imperturbable 
French drollery, 
Or was it self directed banter? 
Habitual ennui 
Took from you, your invisible, hot helmet of anaemia— 
While you were filling your “little glass” from the 
decanter 
Of a transparent-murky, would-be-truthful “hobohemia”— 
And then facetiously 
Went off with it? Your soul’s supplanter, 
The spirit of good narrative, flatters you, convinced that 
in reporting briefly 
One choice incident, you have known beauty other than that 
of stys, on 
Which to fix your admiration. 

_So far as the future is concerned, 
“Shall not one say, with the Russian philosopher, 
‘How is one to know what one doesn’t know?’” 
So far as the present is concerned,_

If external action is effete 
And rhyme is outmoded, 
I shall revert to you, 
Habakkuk, as on a recent occasion I was goaded 
Into doing, by XY, who was speaking of unrhymed 
verse. 
This man said—I think that I repeat 
His identical words: 
“Hebrew poetry is 
Prose with a sort of heightened consciousness. ‘Ecstacy 
affords 
The occasion and expediency determines the form.’” 


A GRAVEYARD.

Man looking into the sea,
taking the view from those who have as much right to it as you have to yourself,
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing,
but you cannot stand in the middle of this;
the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave.
The firs stand in a procession, each with an emerald turkey-foot at the top,
reserved as their contours, saying nothing;
repression, however, is not the most obvious characteristic of the sea;
the sea is a collector, quick to return a rapacious look.
There are others besides you who have worn that look—
whose expression is no longer a protest; the fish no longer investigate them
for their bones have not lasted:
men lower nets, unconscious of the fact that they are desecrating a grave,
and row quickly away—the blades of the oars
moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were no such thing as death.
The wrinkles progress among themselves in a phalanx—beautiful under networks of foam,
and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the seaweed;
the birds swim through the air at top speed, emitting cat-calls as heretofore—
the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion beneath them;
and the ocean, under the pulsation of lighthouses and noise of bellbuoys,
advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which dropped things are bound to sink—
in which if they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor consciousness.
