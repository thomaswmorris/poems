   SONGS OF INNOCENCE

   Piping down the valleys wild,
     Piping songs of pleasant glee,
   On a cloud I saw a child,
     And he laughing said to me:

   "Pipe a song about a Lamb!"
     So I piped with merry cheer.
   "Piper, pipe that song again;"
     So I piped: he wept to hear.

   "Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;
     Sing thy songs of happy cheer!"
   So I sang the same again,
     While he wept with joy to hear.

   "Piper, sit thee down and write
     In a book, that all may read."
   So he vanish'd from my sight;
     And I pluck'd a hollow reed,

   And I made a rural pen,
     And I stain'd the water clear,
   And I wrote my happy songs
     Every child may joy to hear.


   THE SHEPHERD

   How sweet is the Shepherd's sweet lot!
   From the morn to the evening he stays;
   He shall follow his sheep all the day,
   And his tongue shall be filled with praise.

   For he hears the lambs' innocent call,
   And he hears the ewes' tender reply;
   He is watching while they are in peace,
   For they know when their Shepherd is nigh.


   THE ECHOING GREEN

   The sun does arise,
   And make happy the skies;
   The merry bells ring
   To welcome the Spring;
   The skylark and thrush,
   The birds of the bush,
   Sing louder around
   To the bells' cheerful sound;
   While our sports shall be seen
   On the echoing Green.

   Old John, with white hair,
   Does laugh away care,
   Sitting under the oak,
   Among the old folk.
   They laugh at our play,
   And soon they all say,
   "Such, such were the joys
   When we all--girls and boys--
   In our youth-time were seen
   On the echoing Green."

   Till the little ones, weary,
   No more can be merry:
   The sun does descend,
   And our sports have an end.
   Round the laps of their mothers
   Many sisters and brothers,
   Like birds in their nest,
   Are ready for rest,
   And sport no more seen
   On the darkening green.


   THE LAMB

     Little Lamb, who made thee
     Dost thou know who made thee,
   Gave thee life, and bid thee feed
   By the stream and o'er the mead;
   Gave thee clothing of delight,
   Softest clothing, woolly, bright;
   Gave thee such a tender voice,
   Making all the vales rejoice?
     Little Lamb, who made thee?
     Dost thou know who made thee?

     Little Lamb, I'll tell thee;
     Little Lamb, I'll tell thee:
   He is called by thy name,
   For He calls Himself a Lamb
   He is meek, and He is mild,
   He became a little child.
   I a child, and thou a lamb,
   We are called by His name.
     Little Lamb, God bless thee!
     Little Lamb, God bless thee!


   THE LITTLE BLACK BOY

   My mother bore me in the southern wild,
     And I  am black, but oh my soul is white!
   White as an angel is the English child,
     But I am black, as if bereaved of light.

   My mother taught me underneath a tree,
     And, sitting down before the heat of day,
   She took me on her lap and kissed me,
     And, pointed to the east, began to say:

   "Look on the rising sun: there God does live,
     And gives His light, and gives His heat away,
   And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive
     Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.

   "And we are put on earth a little space,
     That we may learn to bear the beams of love
   And these black bodies and this sunburnt face
     Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.

   "For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,
     The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,
   Saying, 'Come out from the grove, my love and care
     And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice',"

   Thus did my mother say, and kissed me;
   And thus I say to little English boy.
   When I from black and he from white cloud free,
   And round the tent of God like lambs we joy

   I'll shade him from the heat till he can bear
   To lean in joy upon our Father's knee;
   And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,
   And be like him, and he will then love me.


   THE BLOSSOM

   Merry, merry sparrow!
   Under leaves so green
   A happy blossom
   Sees you, swift as arrow,
   Seek your cradle narrow,
   Near my bosom.
   Pretty, pretty robin!
   Under leaves so green
   A happy blossom
   Hears you sobbing, sobbing,
   Pretty, pretty robin,
   Near my bosom.


   THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER

   When my mother died I was very young,
   And my father sold me while yet my tongue
   Could scarcely cry "Weep! weep! weep! weep!"
   So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.

   There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,
   That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved; so I said,
   "Hush, Tom! never mind it, for, when your head's bare,
   You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair."

   And so he was quiet, and that very night,
   As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight!--
   That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,
   Were all of them locked up in coffins of black.

   And by came an angel, who had a bright key,
   And he opened the coffins, and let them all free;
   Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run,
   And wash in a river, and shine in the sun.

   Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,
   They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind;
   And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,
   He'd have God for his father, and never want joy.

   And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark,
   And got with our bags and our brushes to work.
   Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm:
   So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.


   THE LITTLE BOY LOST

   "Father, father, where are you going?
     Oh do not walk so fast!
   Speak, father, speak to your little boy,
     Or else I shall be lost."

   The night was dark, no father was there,
     The child was wet with dew;
   The mire was deep, and the child did weep,
     And away the vapour flew.


   THE LITTLE BOY FOUND

   The little boy lost in the lonely fen,
     Led by the wandering light,
   Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,
     Appeared like his father, in white.

   He kissed the child, and by the hand led,
     And to his mother brought,
   Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,
     The little boy weeping sought.


   LAUGHING SONG

   When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,
   And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;
   When the air does laugh with our merry wit,
   And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;

   when the meadows laugh with lively green,
   And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,
   When Mary and Susan and Emily
   With their sweet round mouths sing "Ha, ha he!"

   When the painted birds laugh in the shade,
   Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:
   Come live, and be merry, and join with me,
   To sing the sweet chorus of "Ha, ha, he!"


   A  SONG

   Sweet dreams, form a shade
   O'er my lovely infant's head!
   Sweet dreams of pleasant streams
   By happy, silent, moony beams!

   Sweet Sleep, with soft down
   Weave thy brows an infant crown
   Sweet Sleep, angel mild,
   Hover o'er my happy child!

   Sweet smiles, in the night
   Hover over my delight!
   Sweet smiles, mother's smile,
   All the livelong night beguile.

   Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,
   Chase not slumber from thine eyes!
   Sweet moan, sweeter smile,
   All the dovelike moans beguile.

   Sleep, sleep, happy child!
   All creation slept and smiled.
   Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,
   While o'er thee doth mother weep.

   Sweet babe, in thy face
   Holy image I can trace;
   Sweet babe, once like thee
   Thy Maker lay, and wept for me:

   Wept for me, for thee, for all,
   When He was an infant small.
   Thou His image ever see,
   Heavenly face that smiles on thee!

   Smiles on thee, on me, on all,
   Who became an infant small;
   Infant smiles are his own smiles;
   Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.


   DIVINE IMAGE

   To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
     All pray in their distress,
   And to these virtues of delight
     Return their thankfulness.

   For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
     Is God our Father dear;
   And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
     Is man, his child and care.

   For Mercy has a human heart
     Pity, a human face;
   And Love, the human form divine;
     And Peace, the human dress.

   Then every man, of every clime,
     That prays in his distress,
   Prays to the human form divine:
     Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.

   And all must love the human form,
     In heathen, Turk, or Jew.
   Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell,
     There God is dwelling too.


   HOLY THURSDAY

   'Twas on a Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,
   Came children walking two and two, in read, and blue, and green:
   Grey-headed beadles walked before, with wands as white as snow,
   Till into the high dome of Paul's they like Thames waters flow.

   Oh what a multitude they seemed, these flowers of London town!
   Seated in companies they sit, with radiance all their own.
   The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,
   Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands.

   Now like a mighty wild they raise to heaven the voice of song,
   Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among:
   Beneath them sit the aged man, wise guardians of the poor.
   Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.


   NIGHT

   The sun descending in the west,
   The evening star does shine;
   The birds are silent in their nest,
   And I must seek for mine.
     The moon, like a flower
     In heaven's high bower,
     With silent delight,
     Sits and smiles on the night.

   Farewell, green fields and happy grove,
   Where flocks have ta'en delight.
   Where lambs have nibbled, silent move
   The feet of angels bright;
     Unseen they pour blessing,
     And joy without ceasing,
     On each bud and blossom,
     And each sleeping bosom.

   They look in every thoughtless nest
   Where birds are covered warm;
   They visit caves of every beast,
   To keep them all from harm:
     If they see any weeping
     That should have been sleeping,
     They pour sleep on their head,
     And sit down by their bed.

   When wolves and tigers howl for prey,
   They pitying stand and weep;
   Seeking to drive their thirst away,
   And keep them from the sheep.
     But, if they rush dreadful,
     The angels, most heedful,
     Receive each mild spirit,
     New worlds to inherit.


   And there the lion's ruddy eyes
   Shall flow with tears of gold:
   And pitying the tender cries,
   And walking round the fold:
     Saying: "Wrath by His meekness,
     And, by His health, sickness,
     Are driven away
     From our immortal day.

   "And now beside thee, bleating lamb,
   I can lie down and sleep,
   Or think on Him who bore thy name,
   Graze after thee, and weep.
     For, washed in life's river,
     My bright mane for ever
     Shall shine like the gold,
     As I guard o'er the fold."


   SPRING

        Sound the flute!
        Now it's mute!
        Bird's delight,
        Day and night,
        Nightingale,
        In the dale,
        Lark in sky,--
        Merrily,
   Merrily merrily, to welcome in the year.

        Little boy,
        Full of joy;
        Little girl,
        Sweet and small;
        Cock does crow,
        So do you;
        Merry voice,
        Infant noise;
   Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.

        Little lamb,
        Here I am;
        Come and lick
        My white neck;
        Let me pull
        Your soft wool;
        Let me kiss
        Your soft face;
   Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.


   NURSE'S SONG

   When the voices of children are heard on the green,
     And laughing is heard on the hill,
   My heart is at rest within my breast,
     And everything else is still.
   "Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
     And the dews of night arise;
   Come, come, leave off play, and let us away,
     Till the morning appears in the skies."

   "No, no, let us play, for it is yet day,
     And we cannot go to sleep;
   Besides, in the sky the little birds fly,
     And the hills are all covered with sheep."
   "Well, well, go and play till the light fades away,
     And then go home to bed."
   The little ones leaped, and shouted, and laughed,
     And all the hills echoed.


   INFANT JOY

   "I have no name;
   I am but two days old."
   What shall I call thee?
   "I happy am,
   Joy is my name."
   Sweet joy befall thee!

   Pretty joy!
   Sweet joy, but two days old.
   Sweet Joy I call thee:
   Thou dost smile,
   I sing the while;
   Sweet joy befall thee!


   A DREAM

   Once a dream did weave a shade
   O'er my angel-guarded bed,
   That an emmet lost its way
   Where on grass methought I lay.

   Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,
   Dark, benighted, travel-worn,
   Over many a tangle spray,
   All heart-broke, I heard her say:

   "Oh my children! do they cry,
   Do they hear their father sigh?
   Now they look abroad to see,
   Now return and weep for me."

   Pitying, I dropped a tear:
   But I saw a glow-worm near,
   Who replied, "What wailing wight
   Calls the watchman of the night?

   "I am set to light the ground,
   While the beetle goes his round:
   Follow now the beetle's hum;
   Little wanderer, hie thee home!"


   ON ANOTHER'S SORROW

   Can I see another's woe,
   And not be in sorrow too?
   Can I see another's grief,
   And not seek for kind relief?

   Can I see a falling tear,
   And not feel my sorrow's share?
   Can a father see his child
   Weep, nor be with sorrow filled?

   Can a mother sit and hear
   An infant groan, an infant fear?
   No, no!  never can it be!
   Never, never can it be!

   And can He who smiles on all
   Hear the wren with sorrows small,
   Hear the small bird's grief and care,
   Hear the woes that infants bear--

   And not sit beside the next,
   Pouring pity in their breast,
   And not sit the cradle near,
   Weeping tear on infant's tear?

   And not sit both night and day,
   Wiping all our tears away?
   Oh no! never can it be!
   Never, never can it be!

   He doth give his joy to all:
   He becomes an infant small,
   He becomes a man of woe,
   He doth feel the sorrow too.

   Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,
   And thy Maker is not by:
   Think not thou canst weep a tear,
   And thy Maker is not near.

   Oh He gives to us his joy,
   That our grief He may destroy:
   Till our grief is fled an gone
   He doth sit by us and moan.


   SONGS OF EXPERIENCE

   Hear the voice of the Bard,
   Who present, past, and future, sees;
   Whose ears have heard
   The Holy Word
   That walked among the ancient tree;

   Calling the lapsed soul,
   And weeping in the evening dew;
   That might control
   The starry pole,
   And fallen, fallen light renew!

   "O Earth, O Earth, return!
   Arise from out the dewy grass!
   Night is worn,
   And the morn
   Rises from the slumbrous mass.

   "Turn away no more;
   Why wilt thou turn away?
   The starry floor,
   The watery shore,
   Are given thee till the break of day."


   EARTH'S ANSWER

   Earth raised up her head
   From the darkness dread and drear,
   Her light fled,
   Stony, dread,
   And her locks covered with grey despair.

   "Prisoned on watery shore,
   Starry jealousy does keep my den
   Cold and hoar;
   Weeping o'er,
   I hear the father of the ancient men.

   "Selfish father of men!
   Cruel, jealous, selfish fear!
   Can delight,
   Chained in night,
   The virgins of youth and morning bear?

   "Does spring hide its joy,
   When buds and blossoms grow?
   Does the sower
   Sow by night,
   Or the plowman in darkness plough?

   "Break this heavy chain,
   That does freeze my bones around!
   Selfish, vain,
   Eternal bane,
   That free love with bondage bound."


   THE CLOD AND THE PEBBLE

   "Love seeketh not itself to please,
     Nor for itself hath any care,
   But for another gives it ease,
     And builds a heaven in hell's despair."

   So sang a little clod of clay,
     Trodden with the cattle's feet,
   But a pebble of the brook
     Warbled out these metres meet:

   "Love seeketh only Self to please,
     To bind another to its delight,
   Joys in another's loss of ease,
     And builds a hell in heaven's despite."


   HOLY THURSDAY

   Is this a holy thing to see
     In a rich and fruitful land,--
   Babes reduced to misery,
     Fed with cold and usurous hand?

   Is that trembling cry a song?
     Can it be a song of joy?
   And so many children poor?
     It is a land of poverty!

   And their son does never shine,
     And their fields are bleak and bare,
   And their ways are filled with thorns:
     It is eternal winter there.

   For where'er the sun does shine,
     And where'er the rain does fall,
   Babes should never hunger there,
     Nor poverty the mind appall.


   THE LITTLE GIRL LOST

   In futurity
   I prophetic see
   That the earth from sleep
   (Grave the sentence deep)

   Shall arise, and seek
   for her Maker meek;
   And the desert wild
   Become a garden mild.

   In the southern clime,
   Where the summer's prime
   Never fades away,
   Lovely Lyca lay.

   Seven summers old
   Lovely Lyca told.
   She had wandered long,
   Hearing wild birds' song.

   "Sweet sleep, come to me
   Underneath this tree;
   Do father, mother, weep?
   Where can Lyca sleep?

   "Lost in desert wild
   Is your little child.
   How can Lyca sleep
   If her mother weep?

   "If her heart does ache,
   Then let Lyca wake;
   If my mother sleep,
   Lyca shall not weep.

   "Frowning, frowning night,
   O'er this desert bright
   Let thy moon arise,
   While I close my eyes."

   Sleeping Lyca lay
   While the beasts of prey,
   Come from caverns deep,
   Viewed the maid asleep.

   The kingly lion stood,
   And the virgin viewed:
   Then he gambolled round
   O'er the hallowed ground.

   Leopards, tigers, play
   Round her as she lay;
   While the lion old
   Bowed his mane of gold,

   And her breast did lick
   And upon her neck,
   From his eyes of flame,
   Ruby tears there came;

   While the lioness
   Loosed her slender dress,
   And naked they conveyed
   To caves the sleeping maid.


   THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND

   All the night in woe
   Lyca's parents go
   Over valleys deep,
   While the deserts weep.

   Tired and woe-begone,
   Hoarse with making moan,
   Arm in arm, seven days
   They traced the desert ways.

   Seven nights they sleep
   Among shadows deep,
   And dream they see their child
   Starved in desert wild.

   Pale through pathless ways
   The fancied image strays,
   Famished, weeping, weak,
   With hollow piteous shriek.

   Rising from unrest,
   The trembling woman pressed
   With feet of weary woe;
   She could no further go.

   In his arms he bore
   Her, armed with sorrow sore;
   Till before their way
   A couching lion lay.

   Turning back was vain:
   Soon his heavy mane
   Bore them to the ground,
   Then he stalked around,

   Smelling to his prey;
   But their fears allay
   When he licks their hands,
   And silent by them stands.

   They look upon his eyes,
   Filled with deep surprise;
   And wondering behold
   A spirit armed in gold.

   On his head a crown,
   On his shoulders down
   Flowed his golden hair.
   Gone was all their care.

   "Follow me," he said;
   "Weep not for the maid;
   In my palace deep,
   Lyca lies asleep."

   Then they followed
   Where the vision led,
   And saw their sleeping child
   Among tigers wild.

   To this day they dwell
   In a lonely dell,
   Nor fear the wolvish howl
   Nor the lion's growl.


   THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER

   A little black thing in the snow,
   Crying "weep! weep!" in notes of woe!
   "Where are thy father and mother? Say!"--
   "They are both gone up to the church to pray.

   "Because I was happy upon the heath,
   And smiled among the winter's snow,
   They clothed me in the clothes of death,
   And taught me to sing the notes of woe.

   "And because I am happy and dance and sing,
   They think they have done me no injury,
   And are gone to praise God and his priest and king,
   Who make up a heaven of our misery."


   NURSE'S SONG

   When voices of children are heard on the green,
   And whisperings are in the dale,
   The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind,
   My face turns green and pale.

   Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
   And the dews of night arise;
   Your spring and your day are wasted in play,
   And your winter and night in disguise.


   THE SICK ROSE

   O rose, thou art sick!
     The invisible worm,
   That flies in the night,
     In the howling storm,

   Has found out thy bed
     Of crimson joy,
   And his dark secret love
     Does thy life destroy.


   THE FLY

   Little Fly,
   Thy summer's play
   My thoughtless hand
   Has brushed away.

   Am not I
   A fly like thee?
   Or art not thou
   A man like me?

   For I dance
   And drink, and sing,
   Till some blind hand
   Shall brush my wing.

   If thought is life
   And strength and breath
   And the want
   Of thought is death;

   Then am I
   A happy fly,
   If I live,
   Or if I die.


   THE ANGEL

   I dreamt a dream!  What can it mean?
   And that I was a maiden Queen
   Guarded by an Angel mild:
   Witless woe was ne'er beguiled!

   And I wept both night and day,
   And he wiped my tears away;
   And I wept both day and night,
   And hid from him my heart's delight.

   So he took his wings, and fled;
   Then the morn blushed rosy red.
   I dried my tears, and armed my fears
   With ten-thousand shields and spears.

   Soon my Angel came again;
   I was armed, he came in vain;
   For the time of youth was fled,
   And grey hairs were on my head.


   THE TYGER

   Tyger, tyger, burning bright
   In the forests of the night,
   What immortal hand or eye
   Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

   In what distant deeps or skies
   Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
   On what wings dare he aspire?
   What the hand dare seize the fire?

   And what shoulder and what art
   Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
   And, when thy heart began to beat,
   What dread hand and what dread feet?

   What the hammer?  what the chain?
   In what furnace was thy brain?
   What the anvil? what dread grasp
   Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

   When the stars threw down their spears,
   And watered heaven with their tears,
   Did he smile his work to see?
   Did he who made the lamb make thee?

   Tyger, tyger, burning bright
   In the forests of the night,
   What immortal hand or eye
   Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?


   MY PRETTY ROSE TREE

   A flower was offered to me,
     Such a flower as May never bore;
   But I said "I've a pretty rose tree,"
     And I passed the sweet flower o'er.

   Then I went to my pretty rose tree,
     To tend her by day and by night;
   But my rose turned away with jealousy,
     And her thorns were my only delight.


   AH SUNFLOWER

   Ah Sunflower, weary of time,
     Who countest the steps of the sun;
   Seeking after that sweet golden clime
     Where the traveller's journey is done;

   Where the Youth pined away with desire,
     And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,
   Arise from their graves, and aspire
     Where my Sunflower wishes to go!


   THE LILY

   The modest Rose puts forth a thorn,
   The humble sheep a threat'ning horn:
   While the Lily white shall in love delight,
   Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright.


   THE GARDEN OF LOVE

   I laid me down upon a bank,
     Where Love lay sleeping;
   I heard among the rushes dank
     Weeping, weeping.

   Then I went to the heath and the wild,
     To the thistles and thorns of the waste;
   And they told me how they were beguiled,
     Driven out, and compelled to the chaste.

   I went to the Garden of Love,
     And saw what I never had seen;
   A Chapel was built in the midst,
     Where I used to play on the green.

   And the gates of this Chapel were shut
     And "Thou shalt not," writ over the door;
   So I turned to the Garden of Love
     That so many sweet flowers bore.

   And I saw it was filled with graves,
     And tombstones where flowers should be;
   And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,
     And binding with briars my joys and desires.


   THE LITTLE VAGABOND

   Dear mother, dear mother, the Church is cold;
   But the Alehouse is healthy, and pleasant, and warm.
   Besides, I can tell where I am used well;
   The poor parsons with wind like a blown bladder swell.

   But, if at the Church they would give us some ale,
   And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,
   We'd sing and we'd pray all the livelong day,
   Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray.

   Then the Parson might preach, and drink, and sing,
   And we'd be as happy as birds in the spring;
   And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church,
   Would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch.

   And God, like a father, rejoicing to see
   His children as pleasant and happy as he,
   Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel,
   But kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel.


   LONDON

   I wandered through each chartered street,
     Near where the chartered Thames does flow,
   A mark in every face I meet,
     Marks of weakness, marks of woe.

   In every cry of every man,
     In every infant's cry of fear,
   In every voice, in every ban,
     The mind-forged manacles I hear:

   How the chimney-sweeper's cry
     Every blackening church appalls,
   And the hapless soldier's sigh
     Runs in blood down palace-walls.

   But most, through midnight streets I hear
     How the youthful harlot's curse
   Blasts the new-born infant's tear,
     And blights with plagues the marriage-hearse.


   THE HUMAN ABSTRACT

   Pity would be no more
   If we did not make somebody poor,
   And Mercy no more could be
   If all were as happy as we.

   And mutual fear brings Peace,
   Till the selfish loves increase;
   Then Cruelty knits a snare,
   And spreads his baits with care.

   He sits down with his holy fears,
   And waters the ground with tears;
   Then Humility takes its root
   Underneath his foot.

   Soon spreads the dismal shade
   Of Mystery over his head,
   And the caterpillar and fly
   Feed on the Mystery.

   And it bears the fruit of Deceit,
   Ruddy and sweet to eat,
   And the raven his nest has made
   In its thickest shade.

   The gods of the earth and sea
   Sought through nature to find this tree,
   But their search was all in vain:
   There grows one in the human Brain.


   INFANT SORROW

   My mother groaned, my father wept:
   Into the dangerous world I leapt,
   Helpless, naked, piping loud,
   Like a fiend hid in a cloud.

   Struggling in my father's hands,
   Striving against my swaddling-bands,
   Bound and weary, I thought best
   To sulk upon my mother's breast.


   A POISON TREE

   I was angry with my friend:
   I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
   I was angry with my foe:
   I told it not, my wrath did grow.

   And I watered it in fears
   Night and morning with my tears,
   And I sunned it with smiles
   And with soft deceitful wiles.

   And it grew both day and night,
   Till it bore an apple bright,
   And my foe beheld it shine,
   and he knew that it was mine,--

   And into my garden stole
   When the night had veiled the pole;
   In the morning, glad, I see
   My foe outstretched beneath the tree.


   A LITTLE BOY LOST

   "Nought loves another as itself,
     Nor venerates another so,
   Nor is it possible to thought
     A greater than itself to know.

   "And, father, how can I love you
     Or any of my brothers more?
   I love you like the little bird
     That picks up crumbs around the door."

   The Priest sat by and heard the child;
     In trembling zeal he seized his hair,
   He led him by his little coat,
     And all admired the priestly care.

   And standing on the altar high,
     "Lo, what a fiend is here!" said he:
   "One who sets reason up for judge
     Of our most holy mystery."

   The weeping child could not be heard,
     The weeping parents wept in vain:
   They stripped him to his little shirt,
     And bound him in an iron chain,

   And burned him in a holy place
     Where many had been burned before;
   The weeping parents wept in vain.
     Are such thing done on Albion's shore?


   A LITTLE GIRL LOST

   Children of the future age,
   Reading this indignant page,
   Know that in a former time
   Love, sweet love, was thought a crime.

   In the age of gold,
   Free from winter's cold,
   Youth and maiden bright,
   To the holy light,
   Naked in the sunny beams delight.

   Once a youthful pair,
   Filled with softest care,
   Met in garden bright
   Where the holy light
   Had just removed the curtains of the night.

   Then, in rising day,
   On the grass they play;
   Parents were afar,
   Strangers came not near,
   And the maiden soon forgot her fear.

   Tired with kisses sweet,
   They agree to meet
   When the silent sleep
   Waves o'er heaven's deep,
   And the weary tired wanderers weep.

   To her father white
   Came the maiden bright;
   But his loving look,
   Like the holy book
   All her tender limbs with terror shook.

   "Ona, pale and weak,
   To thy father speak!
   Oh the trembling fear!
   Oh the dismal care
   That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair!"


   THE SCHOOLBOY

   I love to rise on a summer morn,
     When birds are singing on every tree;
   The distant huntsman winds his horn,
     And the skylark sings with me:
     Oh what sweet company!

   But to go to school in a summer morn,--
     Oh it drives all joy away!
   Under a cruel eye outworn,
     The little ones spend the day
     In sighing and dismay.

   Ah then at times I drooping sit,
     And spend many an anxious hour;
   Nor in my book can I take delight,
     Nor sit in learning's bower,
     Worn through with the dreary shower.

   How can the bird that is born for joy
     Sit in a cage and sing?
   How can a child, when fears annoy,
     But droop his tender wing,
     And forget his youthful spring?

   Oh father and mother, if buds are nipped,
     And blossoms blown away;
   And if the tender plants are stripped
     Of their joy in the springing day,
     By sorrow and care's dismay,--

   How shall the summer arise in joy,
     Or the summer fruits appear?
   Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,
     Or bless the mellowing year,
     When the blasts of winter appear?


   TO TIRZAH

   Whate'er is born of mortal birth
   Must be consumed with the earth,
   To rise from generation free:
   Then what have I to do with thee?
   The sexes sprang from shame and pride,
   Blown in the morn, in evening died;
   But mercy changed death into sleep;
   The sexes rose to work and weep.

   Thou, mother of my mortal part,
   With cruelty didst mould my heart,
   And with false self-deceiving tears
   Didst bind my nostrils, eyes, and ears,

   Didst close my tongue in senseless clay,
   And me to mortal life betray.
   The death of Jesus set me free:
   Then what have I to do with thee?


   THE VOICE OF THE ANCIENT BARD

   Youth of delight!  come hither
   And see the opening morn,
   Image of Truth new-born.
   Doubt is fled, and clouds of reason,
   Dark disputes and artful teazing.
   Folly is an endless maze;
   Tangled roots perplex her ways;
   How many have fallen there!
   They stumble all night over bones of the dead;
   And feel--they know not what but care;
   And wish to lead others, when they should be led.


   A DIVINE IMAGE

   Cruelty has a human heart,
     And Jealousy a human face;
   Terror the human form divine,
     And Secresy the human dress.

   The human dress is forged iron,
     The human form a fiery forge,
   The human face a furnace sealed,
     The human heart its hungry gorge.


  THEL'S MOTTO

  Does the Eagle know what is in the pit?
  Or wilt thou go ask the Mole:
  Can Wisdom be put in a silver rod?
  Or Love in a golden bowl?


  THEL

  I

  The daughters of Mne Seraphim led round their sunny flocks,
  All but the youngest: she in paleness sought the secret air.
  To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day:
  Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard;
  And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew.

  O life of this our spring!  why fades the lotus of the water?
  Why fade these children of the spring? born but to smile & fall.
  Ah! Thel is like a watry bow, and like a parting cloud,
  Like a reflection in a glass: like shadows in the water
  Like dreams of infants, like a smile upon an infants face.
  Like the doves voice, like transient day, like music in the air:
  Ah! gentle may I lay me down and gentle rest my head.
  And gentle sleep the sleep of death, and gently hear the voice
  Of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time.

  The Lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass
  Answerd the lovely maid and said: I am a watry weed,
  And I am very small and love to dwell in lowly vales:
  So weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head
  Yet I am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all
  Walks in the valley, and each morn over me spreads his hand
  Saying, rejoice thou humble grass, thou new-born lily flower.
  Thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks:
  For thou shall be clothed in light, and fed with morning manna:
  Till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs
  To flourish in eternal vales: they why should Thel complain.
  Why should the mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh.

  She ceasd & smild in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine.

  Thel answerd, O thou little virgin of the peaceful valley.
  Giving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the o'er tired
  The breath doth nourish the innocent lamb, he smells the milky garments
  He crops thy flowers while thou sittest smiling in his face,
  Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints.
  Thy wine doth purify the golden honey; thy perfume.
  Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs
  Revives the milked cow, & tames the fire-breathing steed.
  But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun:
  I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place.

  Queen of the vales the Lily answered, ask the tender cloud,
  And it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky.
  And why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air.
  Descend O little cloud & hover before the eyes of Thel.

  The Cloud descended and the Lily bowd her modest head:
  And went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass.


  II.

  O little Cloud the virgin said, I charge thee to tell me
  Why thou complainest now when in one hour thou fade away:
  Then we shall seek thee but not find: ah Thel is like to thee.
  I pass away, yet I complain, and no one hears my voice.

  The Cloud then shewd his golden head & his bright form emerg'd.
  Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel.

  O virgin know'st thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs
  Where Luvah doth renew his horses: lookst thou on my youth.
  And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more.
  Nothing remains; O maid I tell thee, when I pass away.
  It is to tenfold life, to love, to peace, and raptures holy:
  Unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers:
  And court the fair eyed dew, to take me to her shining tent
  The weeping virgin, trembling kneels before the risen sun.
  Till we arise link'd in a golden band and never part:
  But walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers.

  Dost thou O little cloud?  I fear that I am not like thee:
  For I walk through the vales of Har, and smell the sweetest flowers:
  But I feed not the little flowers: I hear the warbling birds,
  But I feed not the warbling birds, they fly and seek their food:
  But Thel delights in these no more because I fade away
  And all shall say, without a use this shining women liv'd,
  Or did she only live to be at death the food of worms.

  The Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answerd thus.

  Then if thou art the food of worms, O virgin of the skies,
  How great thy use, how great thy blessing, every thing that lives.
  Lives not alone nor or itself: fear not and I will call,
  The weak worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its voice.
  Come forth worm and the silent valley, to thy pensive queen.

  The helpless worm arose and sat upon the Lillys leaf,
  And the bright Cloud saild on, to find his partner in the vale.


  III.

  Then Thel astonish'd view'd the Worm upon its dewy bed.

  Art thou a Worm?  image of weakness,  art thou but a Worm?
  I see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lillys leaf;
  Ah weep not little voice, thou can'st not speak, but thou can'st weep:
  Is this a Worm?  I see they lay helpless & naked: weeping
  And none to answer, none to cherish thee with mothers smiles.

  The Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice & rais'd her pitying head:
  She bowd over the weeping infant, and her life exhald
  In milky fondness, then on Thel she fix'd her humble eyes;

  O beauty of the vales of Har, we live not for ourselves,
  Thou seest me the meanest thing, and so I am indeed:
  My bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is dark,

  But he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head
  And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast.
  And says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee
  And I have given thee a crown that none can take away.
  But how this is sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know
  I ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love.

  The daughter of beauty wip'd her pitying tears with her white veil,
  And said, Alas!  I knew not this, and therefore did I weep:
  That God would love a Worm I knew, and punish the evil foot
  That wilful bruis'd its helpless form: but that he cherish'd it
  With milk and oil I never knew, and therefore did I weep,
  And I complaind in the mild air, because I fade away.
  And lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot.

  Queen of the vales, the matron Clay answered: I heard thy sighs.
  And all thy moans flew o'er my roof, but I have call'd them down:
  Wilt thou O Queen enter my house, tis given thee to enter,
  And to return: fear nothing, enter with thy virgin feet.


  IV.

  The eternal gates terrific porter lifted the northern bar:
  Thel enter'd in & saw the secrets of the land unknown;
  She saw the couches of the dead, & where the fibrous roots
  Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists:
  A land of sorrows & of tears where never smile was seen.

  She wandered in the land of clouds thro' valleys dark, listning
  Dolors & lamentations: waiting oft beside the dewy grave
  She stood in silence, listning to the voices of the ground,
  Till to her own grave plot she came, & there she sat down.
  And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.

  Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction?
  Or the glistening Eye to the poison of a smile!
  Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn,
  Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie!
  Or an Eye of gifts & graces showring fruits & coined gold!

  Why a Tongue impress'd with honey from every wind?
  Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?
  Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling & affright
  Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy?
  Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?

  The Virgin started from her seat, & with a shriek,
  Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har.



THE ARGUMENT


    Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burden'd air,
    Hungry clouds swag on the deep.

    Once meek, and in a perilous path
    The just man kept his course along
    The Vale of Death.
    Roses are planted where thorns grow,
    And on the barren heath
    Sing the honey bees.

    Then the perilous path was planted,
    And a river and a spring
    On every cliff and tomb;
    And on the bleached bones
    Red clay brought forth:
    Till the villain left the paths of ease
    To walk in perilous paths, and drive
    The just man into barren climes.

    Now the sneaking serpent walks
    In mild humility;
    And the just man rages in the wilds
    Where lions roam.

    Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burden'd air,
    Hungry clouds swag on the deep.



THE VOICE OF THE DEVIL


All Bibles or sacred codes have been the cause of the following
errors:--

1. That man has two real existing principles, viz., a Body and a Soul.

2. That Energy, called Evil, is alone from the Body; and that Reason,
called Good, is alone from the Soul.

3. That God will torment man in Eternity for following his Energies.

But the following contraries to these are true:--

1. Man has no Body distinct from his Soul. For that called Body is a
portion of Soul discerned by the five senses, the chief inlets of Soul
in this age.

2. Energy is the only life, and is from the Body; and Reason is the
bound or outward circumference of Energy.

3. Energy is Eternal Delight.

Those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be
restrained; and the restrainer or reason usurps its place and governs
the unwilling.

And being restrained, it by degrees becomes passive, till it is only
the shadow of desire.

The history of this is written in Paradise Lost, and the Governor or
Reason is called Messiah.

And the original Archangel or possessor of the command of the heavenly
host is called the Devil, or Satan, and his children are called Sin and
Death.

But in the book of Job, Milton's Messiah is called Satan.

For this history has been adopted by both parties.

It indeed appeared to Reason as if desire was cast out, but the
Devil's account is, that the Messiah fell, and formed a heaven of what
he stole from the abyss.

This is shown in the Gospel, where he prays to the Father to send the
Comforter or desire that Reason may have ideas to build on, the Jehovah
of the Bible being no other than he who dwells in flaming fire. Know
that after Christ's death he became Jehovah.

But in Milton, the Father is Destiny, the Son a ratio of the five
senses, and the Holy Ghost vacuum!





A MEMORABLE FANCY


As I was walking among the fires of Hell, delighted with the enjoyments
of Genius, which to Angels look like torment and insanity, I collected
some of their proverbs, thinking that as the sayings used in a nation
mark its character, so the proverbs of Hell show the nature of infernal
wisdom better than any description of buildings or garments.

When I came home, on the abyss of the five senses, where a flat-sided
steep frowns over the present world, I saw a mighty Devil folded in
black clouds hovering on the sides of the rock; with corroding fires
he wrote the following sentence now perceived by the minds of men, and
read by them on earth:--

    "How do you know but every bird
        that cuts the airy way
    Is an immense world of delight,
        closed by your senses five?"

A MEMORABLE FANCY


The Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel dined with me, and I asked them how
they dared so roundly to assert that God spoke to them, and whether
they did not think at the time that they would be misunderstood, and so
be the cause of imposition.

Isaiah answered: "I saw no God, nor heard any, in a finite organical
perception: but my senses discovered the infinite in everything; and as
I was then persuaded, and remained confirmed, that the voice of honest
indignation is the voice of God, I cared not for consequences, but
wrote."

Then I asked: "Does a firm persuasion that a thing is so, make it so?"

He replied: "All poets believe that it does, and in ages of imagination
this firm persuasion removed mountains; but many are not capable of a
firm persuasion of anything."

Then Ezekiel said: "The philosophy of the East taught the first
principles of human perception; some nations held one principle for
the origin, and some another. We of Israel taught that the Poetic
Genius (as you now call it) was the first principle, and all the others
merely derivative, which was the cause of our despising the Priests and
Philosophers of other countries, and prophesying that all Gods would
at last be proved to originate in ours, and to be the tributaries of
the Poetic Genius. It was this that our great poet King David desired
so fervently, and invokes so pathetically, saying by this he conquers
enemies and governs kingdoms; and we so loved our God that we cursed
in His name all the deities of surrounding nations, and asserted that
they had rebelled. From these opinions the vulgar came to think that
all nations would at last be subject to the Jews.

"This," said he, "like all firm persuasions, is come to pass, for all
nations believe the Jews' code, and worship the Jews' God; and what
greater subjection can be?"

I heard this with some wonder, and must confess my own conviction.
After dinner I asked Isaiah to favour the world with his lost works; he
said none of equal value was lost. Ezekiel said the same of his.

I also asked Isaiah what made him go naked and barefoot three years. He
answered: "The same that made our friend Diogenes the Grecian."

I then asked Ezekiel why he ate dung, and lay so long on his right
and left side. He answered: "The desire of raising other men into a
perception of the infinite. This the North American tribes practise.
And is he honest who resists his genius or conscience, only for the
sake of present ease or gratification?"

       *       *       *       *       *

The ancient tradition that the world will be consumed in fire at the
end of six thousand years is true, as I have heard from Hell.

For the cherub with his flaming sword is hereby commanded to leave his
guard at [the] tree of life, and when he does, the whole creation will
be consumed and appear infinite and holy, whereas it now appears finite
and corrupt.

This will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment.

But first the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul is
to be expunged; this I shall do by printing in the infernal method by
corrosives, which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent
surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.

If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man
as it is, infinite.

For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things through narrow
chinks of his cavern.




A MEMORABLE FANCY


I was in a printing-house in Hell, and saw the method in which
knowledge is transmitted from generation to generation.

In the first chamber was a dragon-man, clearing away the rubbish from a
cave's mouth; within, a number of dragons were hollowing the cave.

In the second chamber was a viper folding round the rock and the cave,
and others adorning it with gold, silver, and precious stones.

In the third chamber was an eagle with wings and feathers of air; he
caused the inside of the cave to be infinite; around were numbers of
eagle-like men, who built palaces in the immense cliffs.

In the fourth chamber were lions of flaming fire raging around and
melting the metals into living fluids.

In the fifth chamber were unnamed forms, which cast the metals into the
expanse.

There they were received by men who occupied the sixth chamber, and
took the forms of books, and were arranged in libraries.

The Giants who formed this world into its sensual existence and now
seem to live in it in chains are in truth the causes of its life and
the sources of all activity, but the chains are the cunning of weak
and tame minds, which have power to resist energy, according to the
proverb, "The weak in courage is strong in cunning."

Thus one portion of being is the Prolific, the other the Devouring. To
the devourer it seems as if the producer was in his chains; but it is
not so, he only takes portions of existence, and fancies that the whole.

But the Prolific would cease to be prolific unless the Devourer as a
sea received the excess of his delights.

Some will say, "Is not God alone the Prolific?" I answer: "God only
acts and is in existing beings or men."

These two classes of men are always upon earth, and they should be
enemies: whoever tries to reconcile them seeks to destroy existence.

Religion is an endeavour to reconcile the two.




Messiah, or Satan, or Tempter, was formerly thought to be one of the
antediluvians who are our Energies.




A MEMORABLE FANCY


An Angel came to me and said: "O pitiable foolish young man! O
horrible, O dreadful state! Consider the hot burning dungeon thou art
preparing for thyself to all Eternity, to which thou art going in such
career."

I said: "Perhaps you will be willing to show me my eternal lot, and we
will contemplate together upon it, and see whether your lot or mine is
most desirable."

So he took me through a stable, and through a church, and down into
the church vault, at the end of which was a mill; through the mill we
went, and came to a cave; down the winding cavern we groped our tedious
way, till a void boundless as a nether sky appeared beneath us, and we
held by the roots of trees, and hung over this immensity; but I said:
"If you please, we will commit ourselves to this void, and see whether
Providence is here also; if you will not, I will." But he answered: "Do
not presume, O young man; but as we here remain, behold thy lot, which
will soon appear when the darkness passes away."

So I remained with him sitting in the twisted root of an oak; he was
suspended in a fungus, which hung with the head downward into the deep.

By degrees we beheld the infinite abyss, fiery as the smoke of a
burning city; beneath us at an immense distance was the sun, black but
shining; round it were fiery tracks on which revolved vast spiders,
crawling after their prey, which flew, or rather swum, in the infinite
deep, in the most terrific shapes of animals sprung from corruption;
and the air was full of them, and seemed composed of them. These are
Devils, and are called powers of the air. I now asked my companion
which was my eternal lot. He said: "Between the black and white
spiders."

But now, from between the black and white spiders, a cloud and fire
burst and rolled through the deep, blackening all beneath so that the
nether deep grew black as a sea, and rolled with a terrible noise.
Beneath us was nothing now to be seen but a black tempest, till looking
East between the clouds and the waves, we saw a cataract of blood mixed
with fire, and not many stones' throw from us appeared and sunk again
the scaly fold of a monstrous serpent. At last to the East, distant
about three degrees, appeared a fiery crest above the waves; slowly
it reared like a ridge of golden rocks, till we discovered two globes
of crimson fire, from which the sea fled away in clouds of smoke; and
now we saw it was the head of Leviathan. His forehead was divided into
streaks of green and purple, like those on a tiger's forehead; soon we
saw his mouth and red gills hang just above the raging foam, tinging
the black deeps with beams of blood, advancing toward us with all the
fury of a spiritual existence.

My friend the Angel climbed up from his station into the mill. I
remained alone, and then this appearance was no more; but I found
myself sitting on a pleasant bank beside a river by moonlight, hearing
a harper who sung to the harp; and his theme was: "The man who never
alters his opinion is like standing water, and breeds reptiles of the
mind."

But I arose, and sought for the mill, and there I found my Angel, who,
surprised, asked me how I escaped.

I answered: "All that we saw was owing to your metaphysics; for when
you ran away, I found myself on a bank by moonlight, hearing a harper.
But now we have seen my eternal lot, shall I show you yours?" He
laughed at my proposal; but I by force suddenly caught him in my arms,
and flew Westerly through the night, till we were elevated above the
earth's shadow; then I flung myself with him directly into the body
of the sun; here I clothed myself in white, and taking in my hand
Swedenborg's volumes, sunk from the glorious clime, and passed all the
planets till we came to Saturn. Here I stayed to rest, and then leaped
into the void between Saturn and the fixed stars.

"Here," said I, "is your lot; in this space, if space it may be
called." Soon we saw the stable and the church, and I took him to the
altar and opened the Bible, and lo! it was a deep pit, into which I
descended, driving the Angel before me. Soon we saw seven houses of
brick. One we entered. In it were a number of monkeys, baboons, and
all of that species, chained by the middle, grinning and snatching at
one another, but withheld by the shortness of their chains. However, I
saw that they sometimes grew numerous, and then the weak were caught
by the strong, and with a grinning aspect, first coupled with and then
devoured by plucking off first one limb and then another till the body
was left a helpless trunk; this, after grinning and kissing it with
seeming fondness, they devoured too. And here and there I saw one
savourily picking the flesh off his own tail. As the stench terribly
annoyed us both, we went into the mill; and I in my hand brought the
skeleton of a body, which in the mill was Aristotle's Analytics.

So the Angel said: "Thy phantasy has imposed upon me, and thou oughtest
to be ashamed."

I answered: "We impose on one another, and it is but lost time to
converse with you whose works are only Analytics."

       *       *       *       *       *

"I have always found that Angels have the vanity to speak of themselves
as the only wise; this they do with a confident insolence sprouting
from systematic reasoning.

"Thus Swedenborg boasts that what he writes is new; though it is only
the contents or index of already published books.

"A man carried a monkey about for a show, and because he was a little
wiser than the monkey, grew vain, and conceived himself as much
wiser than seven men. It is so with Swedenborg; he shows the folly
of churches, and exposes hypocrites, till he imagines that all are
religious, and himself the single one on earth that ever broke a net.

"Now hear a plain fact: Swedenborg has not written one new truth. Now
hear another: he has written all the old falsehoods.

"And now hear the reason: he conversed with Angels who are all
religious, and conversed not with Devils who all hate religion, for he
was incapable through his conceited notions.

"Thus Swedenborg's writings are a recapitulation of all superficial
opinions, and an analysis of the more sublime, but no further.

"Have now another plain fact: any man of mechanical talents may from
the writings of Paracelsus or Jacob Behmen produce ten thousand
volumes of equal value with Swedenborg's, and from those of Dante or
Shakespeare an infinite number.

"But when he has done this, let him not say that he knows better than
his master, for he only holds a candle in sunshine."




A MEMORABLE FANCY


Once I saw a Devil in a flame of fire, who arose before an Angel that
sat on a cloud, and the Devil uttered these words: "The worship of God
is, honouring His gifts in other men each according to his genius, and
loving the greatest men best. Those who envy or calumniate great men
hate God, for there is no other God."

The Angel hearing this became almost blue, but mastering himself he
grew yellow, and at last white-pink and smiling, and then replied:
"Thou idolater, is not God One? and is not He visible in Jesus
Christ? and has not Jesus Christ given His sanction to the law of ten
commandments? and are not all other men fools, sinners, and nothings?"

The Devil answered: "Bray a fool in a mortar with wheat, yet shall not
his folly be beaten out of him. If Jesus Christ is the greatest man,
you ought to love Him in the greatest degree. Now hear how He has given
His sanction to the law of ten commandments. Did He not mock at the
Sabbath, and so mock the Sabbath's God? murder those who were murdered
because of Him? turn away the law from the woman taken in adultery,
steal the labour of others to support Him? bear false witness when
He omitted making a defence before Pilate? covet when He prayed for
His disciples, and when He bid them shake off the dust of their feet
against such as refused to lodge them? I tell you, no virtue can exist
without breaking these ten commandments. Jesus was all virtue, and
acted from impulse, not from rules."

When he had so spoken, I beheld the Angel, who stretched out his arms
embracing the flame of fire, and he was consumed, and arose as Elijah.



I have also the Bible of Hell, which the world shall have whether they
will or no.

One law for the lion and ox is Oppression.




A SONG OF LIBERTY


1. The Eternal Female groan'd; it was heard over all the earth:

2. Albion's coast is sick silent; the American meadows faint.

3. Shadows of prophecy shiver along by the lakes and the rivers, and
mutter across the ocean. France, rend down thy dungeon!

4. Golden Spain, burst the barriers of old Rome!

5. Cast thy keys, O Rome, into the deep--down falling, even to eternity
down falling;

6. And weep!

7. In her trembling hands she took the new-born terror, howling.

8. On those infinite mountains of light now barr'd out by the Atlantic
sea, the new-born fire stood before the starry king.

9. Flagg'd with grey-brow'd snows and thunderous visages, the jealous
wings wav'd over the deep.

10. The speary hand burn'd aloft; unbuckled was the shield; forth went
the hand of jealousy among the flaming hair, and hurl'd the new-born
wonder through the starry night.

11. The fire, the fire is falling!

12. Look up! look up! O citizen of London, enlarge thy countenance! O
Jew, leave counting gold; return to thy oil and wine! O African, black
African! (Go, winged thought, widen his forehead.)

13. The fiery limbs, the flaming hair shot like the sinking sun into
the Western sea.

14. Wak'd from his eternal sleep, the hoary element roaring fled away.

15. Down rush'd, beating his wings in vain, the jealous king, his
grey-brow'd councillors, thunderous warriors, curl'd veterans, among
helms and shields, and chariots, horses, elephants, banners, castles,
slings, and rocks.

16. Falling, rushing, ruining; buried in the ruins, on Urthona's dens.

17. All night beneath the ruins; then their sullen flames, faded,
emerge round the gloomy king.

18. With thunder and fire, leading his starry hosts through the waste
wilderness, he promulgates his ten commandments, glancing his beamy
eyelids over the deep in dark dismay.

19. Where the Son of Fire in his Eastern cloud, while the Morning
plumes her golden breast,

20. Spurning the clouds written with curses, stamps the stony law
to dust, loosing the eternal horses from the dens of night, crying:
"Empire is no more! and now the lion and wolf shall cease."




CHORUS


Let the Priests of the Raven of Dawn, no longer in deadly black, with
hoarse note curse the Sons of Joy. Nor his accepted brethren whom,
tyrant, he calls free, lay the bound or build the roof. Nor pale
religious lechery call that virginity that wishes, but acts not!

For everything that lives is holy.
