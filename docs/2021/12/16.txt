THE frost has settled down upon the trees
And ruthlessly strangled off the fantasies
Of leaves that have gone unnoticed swept like old
Romantic stories now no more to be told.

The trees down the boulevard stand naked in
    thought
Their abundant summery wordage silenced caught
In the grim undertow; naked the trees confront
Implacable winter's long cross-questioning brunt.

Has some hand balanced more leaves in the depths
    of the twigs?
Some dim little efforts placed in the threads of the
    birch?--
It is only the sparrows like dead black leaves on
    the sprigs
Sitting huddled against the cerulean one flesh with
    their perch.

The clear cold sky coldly bethinks itself.
Like vivid thought the air spins bright and all
Trees birds and earth arrested in the after-thought
Awaiting the sentence out from the welkin brought.
