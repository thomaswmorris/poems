A waggon passed with scarlet wheels
  And a yellow body shining new.
“Splendid!” said I. “How fine it feels
To be alive when beauty peels
  The grimy husk from life.” And you

Said “Splendid!” and I thought you’d seen
  That waggon blazing down the street;
But I looked and saw that your gaze had been
On a child that was kicking an obscene
  Brown ordure with his feet.

Our souls are elephants thought I
  Remote behind a prisoning grill
With trunks thrust out to peer and pry
And pounce upon reality;
  And each at his own sweet will

Seizes the bun that he likes best
And passes over all the rest.
