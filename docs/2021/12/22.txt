_For Aline_


Homer, they tell us, was blind and could not see the beautiful faces
 Looking up into his own and reflecting the joy of his dream,
 Yet did he seem
Gifted with eyes that could follow the gods to their holiest places.

I have no vision of gods, not of Eros with love-arrows laden,
 Jupiter thundering death or of Juno his white-breasted queen,
 Yet have I seen
All of the joy of the world in the innocent heart of a maiden.
