Oh come again to Astolat!
I will not ask you to be kind.
And you may go when you will go
And I will stay behind.

I will not say how dear you are
Or ask you if you hold me dear
Or trouble you with things for you
The way I did last year.

So still the orchard Lancelot
So very still the lake shall be
You could not guess--though you should guess--
What is become of me.

So wide shall be the garden-walk
The garden-seat so very wide
You needs must think--if you should think--
The lily maid had died.

Save that a little way away
Iâ€™d watch you for a little while
To see you speak the way you speak
And smile--if you should smile.
