No brigadier throughout the year
So civic as the jay.
A neighbor and a warrior too
With shrill felicity

Pursuing winds that censure us
A February day
The brother of the universe
Was never blown away.

The snow and he are intimate;
I 've often seen them play
When heaven looked upon us all
With such severity

I felt apology were due
To an insulted sky
Whose pompous frown was nutriment
To their temerity.

The pillow of this daring head
Is pungent evergreens;
His larder -- terse and militant --
Unknown refreshing things;

His character a tonic
His future a dispute;
Unfair an immortality
That leaves this neighbor out.
