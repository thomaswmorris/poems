I had a chair at every hearth
When no one turned to see
With "Look at that old fellow there
"And who may he be?"
And therefore do I wander now
And the fret lies on me.

The road-side trees keep murmuring
Ah wherefore murmur ye
As in the old days long gone by
Green oak and poplar tree?
The well-known faces are all gone
And the fret lies on me.
