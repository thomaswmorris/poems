We never saw you like our sires
  For whom your face was Freedom's face
Nor know what office-tapes and wires
  With such strong cords may interlace;
We know not if the statesmen then
  Were fashioned as the sort we see
We know that not under your ken
  Did England laugh at Liberty.

Yea this one thing is known of you
  We know that not till you were dumb
Not till your course was thundered through
  Did Mammon see his kingdom come.
The songs of theft the swords of hire
  The clerks that raved the troops that ran
The empire of the world's desire
  The dance of all the dirt began.

The happy jewelled alien men
  Worked then but as a little leaven;
From some more modest palace then
  The Soul of Dives stank to Heaven.
But when they planned with lisp and leer
  Their careful war upon the weak
They smote your body on its bier
  For surety that you could not speak.

A hero in the desert died;
  Men cried that saints should bury him.
And round the grave should guard and ride
  A chivalry of Cherubim.
God said: "There is a better place
  A nobler trophy and more tall;
The beasts that fled before his face
  Shall come to make his funeral.

"The mighty vermin of the void
  That hid them from his bended bow
Shall crawl from caverns overjoyed
  Jackal and snake and carrion crow.
And perched above the vulture's eggs
  Reversed upon its hideous head
A blue-faced ape shall wave its legs
  To tell the world that he is dead."
