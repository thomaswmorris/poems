History has to live with what was here, 
clutching and close to fumbling all we had-- 
it is so dull and gruesome how we die, 
unlike writing, life never finishes. 
Abel was finished; death is not remote, 
a flash-in-the-pan electrifies the skeptic, 
his cows crowding like skulls against high-voltage wire, 
his baby crying all night like a new machine. 
As in our Bibles, white-faced, predatory, 
the beautiful, mist-drunken hunter's moon ascends-- 
a child could give it a face: two holes, two holes, 
my eyes, my mouth, between them a skull's no-nose-- 
O there's a terrifying innocence in my face 
drenched with the silver salvage of the mornfrost.
