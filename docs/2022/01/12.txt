ALL that I serve will die, all my delights, 
the flesh kindled from my flesh, garden and field, 
the silent lilies standing in the woods, 
the woods, the hill, the whole earth, all 
will burn in man's evil, or dwindle 
in its own age. Let the world bring on me 
the sleep of darkness without stars, so I may know 
my little light taken from me into the seed 
of the beginning and the end, so I may bow 
to mystery, and take my stand on the earth 
like a tree in a field, passing without haste 
or regret toward what will be, my life 
a patient willing descent into the grass.
