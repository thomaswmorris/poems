New Year met me somewhat sad:
  Old Year leaves me tired
Stripped of favorite things I had
  Balked of much desired:
Yet farther on my road to-day
God willing farther on my way.

New Year coming on apace
  What have you to give me?
Bring you scathe or bring you grace
Face me with an honest face;
  You shall not deceive me:
Be it good or ill be it what you will
It needs shall help me on my road
My rugged way to heaven please God.

Watch with me men women and children dear
You whom I love for whom I hope and fear
Watch with me this last vigil of the year.
Some hug their business some their pleasure-scheme;
Some seize the vacant hour to sleep or dream;
Heart locked in heart some kneel and watch apart.

Watch with me blessed spirits who delight
All through the holy night to walk in white
Or take your ease after the long-drawn fight.
I know not if they watch with me: I know
They count this eve of resurrection slow
And cry "How long?" with urgent utterance strong.

Watch with me Jesus in my loneliness:
Though others say me nay yet say Thou yes;
Though others pass me by stop Thou to bless.
Yea Thou dost stop with me this vigil night;
To-night of pain to-morrow of delight:
I Love am Thine; Thou Lord my God art mine.

Passing away saith the World passing away:
Chances beauty and youth sapped day by day:
Thy life never continueth in one stay.
Is the eye waxen dim is the dark hair changing to gray
That hath won neither laurel nor bay?
I shall clothe myself in Spring and bud in May:
Thou root-stricken shalt not rebuild thy decay
On my bosom for aye.
Then I answered: Yea.

Passing away saith my Soul passing away:
With its burden of fear and hope of labor and play;
Hearken what the past doth witness and say:
Rust in thy gold a moth is in thine array
A canker is in thy bud thy leaf must decay.
At midnight at cock-crow at morning one certain day
Lo the Bridegroom shall come and shall not delay:
Watch thou and pray.
Then I answered: Yea.

Passing away saith my God passing away:
Winter passeth after the long delay:
New grapes on the vine new figs on the tender spray
Turtle calleth turtle in Heaven's May.
Though I tarry wait for Me trust Me watch and pray.
Arise come away night is past and lo it is day
My love My sister My spouse thou shalt hear Me say.
Then I answered: Yea.
