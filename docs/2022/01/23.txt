The sky is blue with summer and the sun
The woods are brown as autumn with the tan
It might as well be Tropics and be done
I might as well be born a copper Khan;
I fashion me an oriental fan
Made of the wholly unreceipted bills
Brought by the ice-man sleeping in his van
(A storm is coming on the Chiltern Hills).

I read the Young Philosophers for fun
--Fresh as our sorrow for the late Queen Anne--
The Dionysians whom a pint would stun
The Pantheists who never heard of Pan.
--But through my hair electric needles ran
And on my book a gout of water spills
And on the skirts of heaven the guns began
(A storm is coming on the Chiltern Hills).

O fields of England cracked and dry and dun
O soul of England sick of words and wan!--
The clouds grow dark;--the down-rush has begun.
--It comes it comes as holy darkness can
Black as with banners ban and arriere-ban;
A falling laughter all the valley fills
Deep as God's thunder and the thirst of man:
(A storm is coming on the Chiltern Hills).

Envoi:

Prince Prince-Elective on the modern plan
Fulfilling such a lot of People's Wills
You take the Chiltern Hundreds while you can--
A storm is coming on the Chiltern Hills.
