As I lay with my head in your lap camerado
The confession I made I resume what I said to you and the open air
I resume
I know I am restless and make others so
I know my words are weapons full of danger full of death
For I confront peace security and all the settled laws to
unsettle them
I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever have
been had all accepted me
I heed not and have never heeded either experience cautions
majorities nor ridicule
And the threat of what is call’d hell is little or nothing to me
And the lure of what is call’d heaven is little or nothing to me;
Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me and still
urge you without the least idea what is our destination
Or whether we shall be victorious or utterly quell’d and defeated.
