Tempt me no more; for I
Have known the lightning's hour,
The poet's inward pride,
The certainty of power.
Bayonets are closing round.
I shrink; yet I must wring
A living from despair
And out of steel a song.
Though song, though breath be short,
I'll share not the disgrace
Of those that ran away
Or never left the base.
Comrades, my tongue can speak
No comfortable words,
Calls to a for lorn hope,
Gives work and not rewards.
Oh keep the sickle sharp
And follow still the plough:
Others may reap, though some
See not the winter through.
Father, who endest all,
Pity our broken sleep;
For we lie down with tears
And waken but to weep.
And if our blood alone
Will melt this iron earth,
Take it. It is well spent
Easing a saviour 's birth
