Was it something I said \nthat bound me to you, some mere promise \nor, worse, the fear of loneliness and death? \nA man lost in the woods in the dark, I stood \nstill and said nothing. And then there rose in me, \nlike the earth\u2019s empowering brew rising \nin root and branch, the words of a dream of you \nI did not know I had dreamed. I was a wanderer \nwho feels the solace of his native land \nunder his feet again and moving in his blood. \nI went on, blind and faithful. Where I stepped \nmy track was there to steady me. It was no abyss \nthat lay before me, but only the level ground. \n\n\n\tIII.\n\nSometimes our life reminds me \nof a forest in which there is a graceful clearing \nand in that opening a house, \nan orchard and garden, \ncomfortable shades, and flowers \nred and yellow in the sun, a pattern \nmade in the light for the light to return to. \nThe forest is mostly dark, its ways \nto be made anew day after day, the dark \nricher than the light and more blessed, \nprovided we stay brave \nenough to keep on going in. \n\n\n\tIV.\n\nHow many times have I come to you out of my head \nwith joy, if ever a man was, \nfor to approach you I have given up the light \nand all directions.

The sunshine on my path\nWas to me as a friend. The swelling hills,\nThe quiet dells retiring far between,\nWith gentle invitation to explore\nTheir windings, were a calm society\nThat talked with me and soothed me. Then the chant\nOf birds, and chime of brooks, and soft caress\nOf the fresh sylvan air, made me forget\nThe thoughts that broke my peace, and I began\nTo gather simples by the fountain\u2019s brink,\nAnd lose myself in day-dreams. While I stood\nIn nature\u2019s loneliness, I was with one\nWith whom I early grew familiar, one\nWho never had a frown for me, whose voice\nNever rebuked me for the hours I stole\nFrom cares I loved not, but of which the world\nDeems highest, to converse with her. When shrieked\nThe bleak November winds, and smote the woods,\nAnd the brown fields were herbless, and the shades,\nThat met above the merry rivulet,\nWere spoiled, I sought, I loved them still,--they seemed\nLike old companions in adversity.\nStill there was beauty in my walks; the brook,\nBordered with sparkling frost-work, was as gay\nAs with its fringe of summer flowers. Afar,\nThe village with its spires, the path of streams,\nAnd dim receding valleys, hid before\nBy interposing trees, lay visible\nThrough the bare grove, and my familiar haunts\nSeemed new to me. Nor was I slow to come\nAmong them, when the clouds, from their still skirts,\nHad shaken down on earth the feathery snow,\nAnd all was white. The pure keen air abroad,\nAlbeit it breathed no scent of herb, nor heard\nLove-call of bird, nor merry hum of bee,\nWas not the air of death. Bright mosses crept\nOver the spotted trunks, and the close buds,\nThat lay along the boughs, instinct with life,\nPatient, and waiting the soft breath of Spring,\nFeared not the piercing spirit of the North.\nThe snow-bird twittered on the beechen bough,\nAnd \u2018neath the hemlock, whose thick branches bent\nBeneath its bright cold burden, and kept dry\nA circle, on the earth, of withered leaves,\nThe partridge found a shelter. Through the snow\nThe rabbit sprang away. The lighter track\nOf fox, and the racoon\u2019s broad path, were there,\nCrossing each other. From his hollow tree,\nThe squirrel was abroad, gathering the nuts\nJust fallen, that asked the winter cold and sway\nOf winter blast, to shake them from their hold.\n\n  But Winter has yet brighter scenes,--he boasts\nSplendours beyond what gorgeous Summer knows;\nOr Autumn with his many fruits, and woods\nAll flushed with many hues. Come when the rains\nHave glazed the snow, and clothed the trees with ice;\nWhile the slant sun of February pours\nInto the bowers a flood of light. Approach!\nThe incrusted surface shall upbear thy steps,\nAnd the broad arching portals of the grove\nWelcome thy entering. Look! the massy trunks\nAre cased in the pure crystal; each light spray,\nNodding and tinkling in the breath of heaven,\nIs studded with its trembling water-drops,\nThat stream with rainbow radiance as they move.\nBut round the parent stem the long low boughs\nBend, in a glittering ring, and arbours hide\nThe glassy floor. Oh! you might deem the spot\nThe spacious cavern of some virgin mine,\nDeep in the womb of earth--where the gems grow,\nAnd diamonds put forth radiant rods and bud\nWith amethyst and topaz--and the place\nLit up, most royally, with the pure beam\nThat dwells in them. Or haply the vast hall\nOf fairy palace, that outlasts the night,\nAnd fades not in the glory of the sun;--\nWhere crystal columns send forth slender shafts\nAnd crossing arches; and fantastic aisles\nWind from the sight in brightness, and are lost\nAmong the crowded pillars. Raise thine eye,--\nThou seest no cavern roof, no palace vault;\nThere the blue sky and the white drifting cloud\nLook in. Again the wildered fancy dreams\nOf spouting fountains, frozen as they rose,\nAnd fixed, with all their branching jets, in air,\nAnd all their sluices sealed. All, all is light;\nLight without shade. But all shall pass away\nWith the next sun. From numberless vast trunks,\nLoosened, the crashing ice shall make a sound\nLike the far roar of rivers, and the eve\nShall close o\u2019er the brown woods as it was wont.\n\n  And it is pleasant, when the noisy streams\nAre just set free, and milder suns melt off\nThe plashy snow, save only the firm drift\nIn the deep glen or the close shade of pines,--\n\u2018Tis pleasant to behold the wreaths of smoke\nRoll up among the maples of the hill,\nWhere the shrill sound of youthful voices wakes\nThe shriller echo, as the clear pure lymph,\nThat from the wounded trees, in twinkling drops,\nFalls, mid the golden brightness of the morn,\nIs gathered in with brimming pails, and oft,\nWielded by sturdy hands, the stroke of axe\nMakes the woods ring. Along the quiet air,\nCome and float calmly off the soft light clouds,\nSuch as you see in summer, and the winds\nScarce stir the branches. Lodged in sunny cleft,\nWhere the cold breezes come not, blooms alone\nThe little wind-flower, whose just opened eye\nIs blue as the spring heaven it gazes at--\nStartling the loiterer in the naked groves\nWith unexpected beauty, for the time\nOf blossoms and green leaves is yet afar.\nAnd ere it comes, the encountering winds shall oft\nMuster their wrath again, and rapid clouds\nShade heaven, and bounding on the frozen earth\nShall fall their volleyed stores rounded like hail,\nAnd white like snow, and the loud North again\nShall buffet the vexed forest in his rage.", "keywords": ["winter"]}, "THE WEST WIND": {"body": "Beneath the forest\u2019s skirts I rest,\n  Whose branching pines rise dark and high,\nAnd hear the breezes of the West\n  Among the threaded foliage sigh.\n\nSweet Zephyr! why that sound of woe?\n  Is not thy home among the flowers?\nDo not the bright June roses blow,\n  To meet thy kiss at morning hours?\n\nAnd lo! thy glorious realm outspread--\n  Yon stretching valleys, green and gay,\nAnd yon free hill-tops, o\u2019er whose head\n  The loose white clouds are borne away.\n\nAnd there the full broad river runs,\n  And many a fount wells fresh and sweet,\nTo cool thee when the mid-day suns\n  Have made thee faint beneath their heat.\n\nThou wind of joy, and youth, and love;\n  Spirit of the new-wakened year!\nThe sun in his blue realm above\n  Smooths a bright path when thou art here.\n\nIn lawns the murmuring bee is heard,\n  The wooing ring-dove in the shade;\nOn thy soft breath, the new-fledged bird\n  Takes wing, half happy, half afraid.\n\nAh! thou art like our wayward race;--\n  When not a shade of pain or ill\nDims the bright smile of Nature\u2019s face,\n  Thou lovest to sigh and murmur still.", "keywords": []}, "THE BURIAL-PLACE": {"body": "  Erewhile, on England\u2019s pleasant shores, our sires\nLeft not their churchyards unadorned with shades\nOr blossoms; and indulgent to the strong\nAnd natural dread of man\u2019s last home, the grave,\nIts frost and silence--they disposed around,\nTo soothe the melancholy spirit that dwelt\nToo sadly on life\u2019s close, the forms and hues\nOf vegetable beauty.--There the yew,\nGreen even amid the snows of winter, told\nOf immortality, and gracefully\nThe willow, a perpetual mourner, drooped;\nAnd there the gadding woodbine crept about,\nAnd there the ancient ivy.

Shouting boys, let loose\nFor a wild holiday, have quaintly shaped\nInto a cup the folded linden leaf,\nAnd dipped thy sliding crystal.

low:\nAnd all the little Oysters stood\n      And waited in a row.\n\nThe time has come,\u2018 the Walrus said,\n      To talk of many things:\nOf shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--\n      Of

little blue.\nAfter such kindness, that would be\n      A dismal thing to do!\u2019\nThe night is fine,\u2018 the Walrus said.\n      Do you admire the view?\n\nIt was so kind of you to come!\n      And you are very nice!\u2019\nThe Carpenter said nothing but\n      Cut us another slice:\nI wish you were not quite so deaf--\n      I\u2019ve had to ask you twice!\u2019\n\nIt seems a shame,\u2018 the Walrus said,\n      To play them such a trick,\nAfter we\u2019ve brought them out so far,\n      And made them trot so quick!\u2019\nThe Carpenter said nothing but\n      The butter\u2019s spread

 Before his streaming eyes.\n\nO Oysters,\u2018 said the Carpenter,\n      You\u2019ve had a pleasant run!\nShall we be trotting home again?\u2019\n      But answer came there none--\nAnd this was

\nBut joys which soothe, and not distract the ears, \nThat one at leisure meets \nIn the green woods, and meadows summer-shorn, \nOr fields, where bee-fly greets \nThe ear with mellow horn. \n\nThe green-swathed grasshopper, on treble pipe, \nSings there, and dances, in mad-hearted pranks; \nThere bees go courting every flower that\u2019s ripe, \nOn baulks and sunny banks; \nAnd droning dragon-fly, on rude bassoon, \nAttempts to give God thanks \nIn no discordant tune. \n\nThe speckled thrush, by self-delight embued, \nThere sings unto himself for joy\u2019s amends, \nAnd drinks the honey dew of solitude. \nThere Happiness attends \nWith inbred Joy until the heart o\u2019erflow, \nOf which the world\u2019s rude friends, \nNought heeding, nothing know. \n\nThere the gay river, laughing as it goes, \nPlashes with easy wave its flaggy sides, \nAnd to the calm of heart, in calmness shows \nWhat pleasure there abides, \nTo trace its sedgy banks, from trouble free: \nSpots Solitude provides \nTo muse, and happy be. \n\nThere ruminating \u2018neath some pleasant bush, \nOn sweet silk grass I stretch me at mine ease, \nWhere I can pillow on the yielding rush; \nAnd, acting as I please, \nDrop into pleasant dreams; or musing lie, \nMark the wind-shaken trees, \nAnd cloud-betravelled sky. \n\nThere think me how some barter joy for care, \nAnd waste life\u2019s summer-health in riot rude, \nOf nature, nor of nature\u2019s sweets aware. \nWhen passions vain intrude, \nThese, by calm musings, softened are and still; \nAnd the heart\u2019s better mood \nFeels sick of doing ill. \n\nThere I can live, and at my leisure seek \nJoys far from cold restraints--not fearing pride-- \nFree as the winds, that breathe upon my cheek \nRude health, so long denied. \nHere poor Integrity can sit at ease, \nAnd list self-satisfied \nThe song of honey-bees. \n\nThe green lane now I traverse, where it goes \nNought guessing, till some sudden turn espies \nRude batter\u2019d finger post, that stooping shows \nWhere the snug mystery lies;

\nThe gay convolvulus, wreathing round the thorn, \nAgape for honey showers; \nAnd slender kingcup, burnished with the dew \nOf morning\u2019s early hours, \nLike gold yminted new. \n\nAnd mark by rustic bridge, o\u2019er shallow stream, \nCow-tending boy, to toil unreconciled, \nAbsorbed as in some vagrant summer dream; \nWho now, in gestures wild, \nStarts dancing to his shadow on the wall, \nFeeling self-gratified, \nNor fearing human thrall. \n\nOr thread the sunny valley laced with streams, \nOr forests rude, and the o\u2019ershadow\u2019d brims \nOf simple ponds, where idle shepherd dreams, \nStretching his listless limbs; \nOr trace hay-scented meadows, smooth and long, \nWhere joy\u2019s wild impulse swims \nIn one continued song. \n\nI love at early morn, from new mown swath, \nTo see the startled frog his route pursue; \nTo mark while, leaping o\u2019er the dripping path, \nHis bright sides scatter dew, \nThe early lark that from its bustle flies, \nTo hail his matin new; \nAnd watch him to the skies. \n\nTo note on hedgerow baulks, in moisture sprent, \nThe jetty snail creep from the mossy thorn, \nWith earnest heed, and tremulous intent, \nFrail brother of the morn, \nThat from the tiny bent\u2019s dew-misted leaves \nWithdraws his timid horn, \nAnd fearful vision weaves. \n\nOr swallow heed on smoke-tanned chimney top, \nWont to be first unsealing Morning\u2019s eye, \nEre yet the bee hath gleaned one wayward drop \nOf honey on his thigh; \nTo see him seek morn\u2019s airy couch to sing, \nUntil the golden sky \nBepaint his russet wing. \n\nOr sauntering boy by tanning corn to spy, \nWith clapping noise to startle birds away, \nAnd hear him bawl to every passer by \nTo know the hour of day; \nWhile the uncradled breezes, fresh and strong, \nWith waking blossoms play, \nAnd breathe \u00c6olian song. \n\nI love the south-west wind, or low or loud, \nAnd not the less when sudden drops of rain \nMoisten my glowing cheek from ebon cloud, \nThreatening soft showers again, \nThat over lands new ploughed and meadow grounds, \nSummer\u2019s sweet breath unchain, \nAnd wake harmonious sounds. \n\nRich music breathes in Summer\u2019s every sound; \nAnd in her harmony of varied greens, \nWoods, meadows, hedge-rows, corn-fields, all around \nMuch beauty intervenes, \nFilling with harmony the ear and eye; \nWhile o\u2019er the mingling scenes \nFar spreads the laughing sky. \n\nSee, how the wind-enamoured aspen leaves \nTurn up their silver lining to the sun! \nAnd hark! the rustling noise, that oft deceives, \nAnd makes the sheep-boy run: \nThe sound so mimics fast-approaching showers, \nHe thinks the rain\u2019s begun, \nAnd hastes to sheltering bowers. \n\nBut now the evening curdles dank and grey, \nChanging her watchet hue for sombre weed; \nAnd moping owls, to close the lids of day, \nOn drowsy wing proceed; \nWhile chickering crickets, tremulous and long, \nLight\u2019s farewell inly heed, \nAnd give it parting song. \n\nThe pranking bat its flighty circlet makes; \nThe glow-worm burnishes its lamp anew; \nO\u2019er meadows dew-besprent, the beetle wakes \nInquiries ever new, \nTeazing each passing ear with murmurs vain, \nAs wanting to pursue \nHis homeward path again. \n\nHark! \u2018tis the melody of distant bells \nThat on the wind with pleasing hum rebounds \nBy fitful starts, then musically swells \nO\u2019er the dim stilly grounds; \nWhile on the meadow-bridge the pausing boy \nListens the mellow sounds, \nAnd hums in vacant joy. \n\nNow homeward-bound, the hedger bundles round \nHis evening faggot, and with every stride \nHis leathern doublet leaves a rustling sound, \nTill silly sheep beside \nHis path start tremulous, and once again \nLook back dissatisfied, \nAnd scour the dewy plain. \n\nHow sweet the soothing calmness that distills \nO\u2019er the heart\u2019s every sense its opiate dews, \nIn meek-eyed moods and ever balmy trills! \nThat softens and subdues, \nWith gentle Quiet\u2019s bland and sober train, \nWhich dreamy eve renews \nIn many a mellow strain! \n\nI love to walk the fields, they are to me \nA legacy no evil can destroy; \nThey, like a spell, set every rapture free \nThat cheer\u2019d me when a boy. \nPlay--pastime--all Time\u2019s blotting pen conceal\u2019d, \nComes like a new-born joy, \nTo greet me in the field. \n\nFor Nature\u2019s objects ever harmonize \nWith emulous Taste, that vulgar deed annoys;

Though they mean only good,\nFamilies can become a sort of burden.\nI\u2019ve only got my father, and he won\u2019t come,\nPoor man, because it would be too much for him.\nAnd for me, too, so it\u2019s best the way it is.\nHe knows, you see, that I will predecease him,\nWhich is hard enough. It would take a callous man\nTo come and stand around and watch me failing.\n(Now don\u2019t you fuss; we both know the plain facts.)\nBut for him it\u2019s even harder. He loved my mother.\nThey say she looked like me; I suppose she may have.\nOr rather, as I grew older I came to look\nMore and more like she must one time have looked,\nAnd so the prospect for my father now\nOf losing me is like having to lose her twice.\nI know he frets about me.

One by one,\nThey stand there like magnificent enlargements\nOf the vascular system of the human brain.\nI see them there like huge discarnate minds,\nLost in their meditative silences.\nThe trunks, branches and twigs compose the vessels\nThat feed and nourish vast immortal thoughts.\nSo I\u2019ve assigned them names.

One year her parents gave her\nA birthday toy called \u201cThe Transparent Man.\u201d\nIt was made of plastic, with different colored organs,\nAnd the circulatory system all mapped out\nIn rivers of red and blue. She\u2019d ask me over\nAnd the two of us would sit and study him\nTogether, and do a powerful lot of giggling.\nI figure he\u2019s most likely the only man\nEither of us would ever get to know\nIntimately, because Mary Beth became\nA Sister of Mercy when she was old enough.\nShe must be thirty-one; she was a year\nOlder than I, and about four inches taller.\nI used to envy both those advantages\nBack in those days. Anyway, I was struck\nRight from the start by the sea-weed intricacy,\nThe fine-haired, silken-threaded filiations\nThat wove, like Belgian lace, throughout the head.\nBut this last week it seems I have found myself\nLooking beyond, or through, individual trees\nAt the dense, clustered woodland just behind them,\nWhere those great, nameless crowds patiently stand.\nIt\u2019s become a sort of complex, ultimate puzzle\nAnd keeps me fascinated. My eyes are twenty-twenty,\nOr used to be, but of course I can\u2019t unravel\nThe tousled snarl of intersecting limbs,\nThat mackled, cinder grayness.

be wrong;\nAnd so with troubled heart yet stout\nShe plans how ever to get out\n  With meditations long.\n\nThe bank is higher than her head\nAnd slippery too as I have said;\n  And what to do with baby?\nFor even the monkey when he goes\nNeeds both his fingers and his toes.--\n  She is perplexed as may be.\n\nBut all her puzzling was no good\nThough staring up the bank she stood\n  Which as she sunk grew higher;\nUntil invaded with dismay\nLest baby\u2019s patience should give way\n  She frees her from the mire.\n\nAnd up and down the ditch not glad\nBut patient she did promenade;\n  Splash!

the moss \nLeering at each other \nBrother with queer brother; \nSignalling each other \nBrother with sly brother. \nOne set his basket down \nOne rear\u2019d his plate; \nOne began to weave a crown \nOf tendrils leaves and rough nuts brown \n(Men sell not such in any town); \nOne heav\u2019d the golden weight \nOf dish and fruit to offer her: \n\u201cCome buy come buy\u201d was still their cry. \nLaura stared but did not stir \nLong\u2019d but had no money: \nThe whisk-tail\u2019d merchant bade her taste \nIn tones as smooth as honey \nThe cat-faced purr\u2019d \nThe rat-faced spoke a word

sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste: \n\u201cGood folk I have no coin; \nTo take were to purloin: \nI have no copper in my purse \nI have no silver either \nAnd all my gold is on the furze \nThat shakes in windy weather \nAbove the rusty heather.\u201d \n\u201cYou have much gold upon your head\u201d \nThey answer\u2019d all together: \n\u201cBuy from us with a golden curl.\u201d \nShe clipp\u2019d a

than water flow\u2019d that juice; \nShe never tasted such before \nHow should it cloy with length of use? \nShe suck\u2019d and suck\u2019d and suck\u2019d the more \nFruits which that unknown orchard bore; \nShe suck\u2019d until her lips were sore; \nThen flung the emptied rinds away \nBut gather\u2019d up one kernel stone \nAnd knew not was it night or day \nAs she turn\u2019d home alone. \n\nLizzie met her at the gate \nFull of wise upbraidings: \n\u201cDear you should not stay so late \nTwilight is not good for maidens; \nShould not loiter in the glen \nIn the haunts of goblin

at all hours? \nBut ever in the noonlight \nShe pined and pined away; \nSought them by night and day \nFound them no more but dwindled and grew grey; \nThen fell with the first snow \nWhile to this day no grass will grow \nWhere she lies low: \nI planted daisies there a year ago \nThat never blow. \nYou should not loiter so.\u201d \n\u201cNay hush\u201d said Laura: \n\u201cNay hush my sister:

their mother twigs \nCherries worth getting; \nYou cannot think what figs \nMy teeth have met in \nWhat melons icy-cold \nPiled on a dish of gold \nToo huge for me to hold \nWhat peaches with a velvet nap \nPellucid grapes without one seed: \nOdorous indeed must be the mead \nWhereon they grow and pure the wave they drink \nWith lilies at the brink \nAnd sugar-sweet their sap.\u201d \n\nGolden head by golden head \nLike two pigeons in one nest \nFolded in each other\u2019s wings \nThey lay down in their curtain\u2019d bed: \nLike two blossoms on one stem \nLike two flakes of new-fall\u2019n snow \nLike two wands of ivory \nTipp\u2019d with gold for awful kings. \nMoon and stars gaz\u2019d in at them \nWind sang to them lullaby \nLumbering owls forbore to fly \nNot a bat flapp\u2019d to and fro \nRound their rest: \nCheek to cheek and breast to breast \nLock\u2019d together in one nest. \n\nEarly in the morning \nWhen the first cock crow\u2019d his warning \nNeat like bees as sweet and busy \nLaura rose with Lizzie: \nFetch\u2019d in honey milk\u2019d the cows \nAir\u2019d and set to rights the house \nKneaded cakes of whitest wheat \nCakes for dainty mouths to eat \nNext churn\u2019d butter whipp\u2019d up cream \nFed their poultry sat and sew\u2019d; \nTalk\u2019d as modest maidens should: \nLizzie with an open heart \nLaura in an absent dream \nOne content one sick in part; \nOne warbling for the mere bright day\u2019s delight \nOne longing for the night. \n\nAt length slow evening came: \nThey went with pitchers to the reedy brook; \nLizzie most placid in her look \nLaura most like a leaping flame. \nThey drew the gurgling water from its deep; \nLizzie pluck\u2019d purple and rich golden flags \nThen turning homeward said: \u201cThe sunset flushes \nThose furthest loftiest crags; \nCome Laura not another maiden lags. \nNo wilful squirrel wags \nThe beasts and birds are fast asleep.\u201d \nBut Laura loiter\u2019d still among the rushes \nAnd said the bank was steep. \n\nAnd said the hour was early still \nThe dew not fall\u2019n the wind not chill; \nListening ever but not catching \nThe customary cry \n\u201cCome buy come buy\u201d \nWith its iterated jingle \nOf sugar-baited words: \nNot for all her watching \nOnce discerning even one goblin \nRacing whisking tumbling hobbling; \nLet alone the herds \nThat used to tramp along the glen \nIn groups or single \nOf brisk fruit-merchant men. \n\nTill Lizzie urged \u201cO Laura come; \nI hear the fruit-call but I dare not look: \nYou should not loiter longer at this brook: \nCome with me home. \nThe stars rise the moon bends her arc \nEach glowworm winks her spark \nLet us get home before the night grows dark: \nFor clouds may gather \nThough this is summer weather \nPut out the lights and drench us through; \nThen if we lost our way what should we do?\u201d \n\nLaura turn\u2019d cold as stone \nTo find her sister heard that cry alone \nThat goblin cry \n\u201cCome buy our fruits come buy.\u201d \nMust she then buy no more such dainty fruit? \nMust she no more such succous pasture find \nGone deaf and blind? \nHer tree of life droop\u2019d from the root: \nShe said not one word in her heart\u2019s sore ache; \nBut peering thro\u2019 the dimness nought discerning \nTrudg\u2019d home her pitcher dripping all the way; \nSo crept to bed and lay \nSilent till Lizzie slept; \nThen sat up in a passionate yearning \nAnd gnash\u2019d her teeth for baulk\u2019d desire and wept \nAs if her heart would break. \n\nDay after day night after night \nLaura kept watch in vain \nIn sullen silence of exceeding pain. \nShe never caught again the goblin cry: \n\u201cCome buy come buy;\u201d\u2014 \nShe never spied the goblin men \nHawking their fruits along the glen: \nBut when the noon wax\u2019d bright \nHer hair grew thin and grey; \nShe dwindled as the fair full moon doth turn \nTo swift decay and burn \nHer fire away. \n\nOne day remembering her kernel-stone \nShe set it by a wall that faced the south; \nDew\u2019d it with tears hoped for a root \nWatch\u2019d for a waxing shoot \nBut there came none; \nIt never saw the sun \nIt never felt the trickling moisture run: \nWhile with sunk eyes and faded mouth \nShe dream\u2019d of melons as a traveller sees \nFalse waves in desert drouth \nWith shade of leaf-crown\u2019d trees \nAnd burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze. \n\nShe no more swept the house \nTended the fowls or cows \nFetch\u2019d honey kneaded cakes of wheat \nBrought water from the brook: \nBut sat down listless in the chimney-nook \nAnd would not eat. \n\nTender Lizzie could not bear \nTo watch her sister\u2019s cankerous care \nYet not to share. \nShe night and morning \nCaught the goblins\u2019 cry: \n\u201cCome buy our orchard fruits \nCome buy come buy;\u201d\u2014 \nBeside the brook along the glen \nShe heard the tramp of goblin men \nThe yoke and stir \nPoor Laura could not hear; \nLong\u2019d to buy fruit to comfort her \nBut fear\u2019d to pay too dear. \nShe thought of Jeanie in her grave \nWho should have been a bride; \nBut who for joys brides hope to have \nFell sick and died \nIn her gay prime \nIn earliest winter time \nWith the first glazing rime \nWith the first snow-fall of crisp winter time. \n\nTill Laura dwindling \nSeem\u2019d knocking at Death\u2019s door: \nThen Lizzie weigh\u2019d no more \nBetter and worse; \nBut put a silver penny in her purse \nKiss\u2019d Laura cross\u2019d the heath with clumps of furze \nAt twilight halted by the brook: \nAnd for the first time in her life \nBegan to listen and look. \n\nLaugh\u2019d every goblin \nWhen they spied her peeping: \nCame towards her hobbling \nFlying running leaping \nPuffing and blowing \nChuckling clapping crowing \nClucking and gobbling \nMopping and mowing \nFull of airs and graces \nPulling wry faces \nDemure grimaces \nCat-like and rat-like \nRatel- and wombat-like \nSnail-paced in a hurry \nParrot-voiced and whistler \nHelter skelter hurry skurry \nChattering like magpies \nFluttering like pigeons \nGliding like fishes\u2014 \nHugg\u2019d her and kiss\u2019d her: \nSqueez\u2019d and caress\u2019d her: \nStretch\u2019d up their dishes \nPanniers and plates: \n\u201cLook at our apples \nRusset and dun \nBob at our cherries \nBite at our peaches \nCitrons and dates \nGrapes for the asking \nPears red with basking \nOut in the sun \nPlums on their twigs; \nPluck them and suck them \nPomegranates figs.\u201d\u2014 \n\n\u201cGood folk\u201d said Lizzie \nMindful of Jeanie: \n\u201cGive me much and many: \u2014 \nHeld out her apron \nToss\u2019d them her penny. \n\u201cNay take a seat with us \nHonour and eat with us\u201d \nThey answer\u2019d grinning: \n\u201cOur feast is but beginning. \nNight yet is early \nWarm and dew-pearly \nWakeful and starry: \nSuch fruits as these \nNo man can carry: \nHalf their bloom would fly \nHalf their dew would dry \nHalf their flavour would pass by. \nSit down and feast with us \nBe welcome guest with us \nCheer you and rest with us.\u201d\u2014 \n\u201cThank you\u201d said Lizzie: \u201cBut one waits \nAt home alone for me: \nSo without further parleying \nIf you will not sell me any \nOf your fruits though much and many \nGive me back my silver penny \nI toss\u2019d you for a fee.\u201d\u2014 \nThey began to scratch their pates \nNo longer wagging purring \nBut visibly demurring \nGrunting and snarling. \nOne call\u2019d her proud \nCross-grain\u2019d uncivil; \nTheir tones wax\u2019d loud \nTheir looks were evil. \nLashing their tails \nThey trod and hustled her \nElbow\u2019d and jostled her \nClaw\u2019d with their nails \nBarking mewing hissing mocking \nTore her gown and soil\u2019d her stocking \nTwitch\u2019d her hair out by the roots \nStamp\u2019d upon her tender feet \nHeld her hands and squeez\u2019d their fruits \nAgainst her mouth to make her eat. \n\nWhite and golden Lizzie stood \nLike a lily in a flood\u2014 \nLike a rock of blue-vein\u2019d stone \nLash\u2019d by tides obstreperously\u2014 \nLike a beacon left alone \nIn a hoary roaring sea \nSending up a golden fire\u2014 \nLike a fruit-crown\u2019d orange-tree \nWhite with blossoms honey-sweet \nSore beset by wasp and bee\u2014 \nLike a royal virgin town \nTopp\u2019d with gilded dome and spire \nClose beleaguer\u2019d by a fleet \nMad to tug her standard down. \n\nOne may lead a horse to water \nTwenty cannot make him drink. \nThough the goblins cuff\u2019d and caught her \nCoax\u2019d and fought her \nBullied and besought her \nScratch\u2019d her pinch\u2019d her black as ink \nKick\u2019d and knock\u2019d her \nMaul\u2019d and mock\u2019d her \nLizzie utter\u2019d not a word; \nWould not open lip from lip \nLest they should cram a mouthful in: \nBut laugh\u2019d in heart to feel the drip \nOf juice that syrupp\u2019d all her face \nAnd lodg\u2019d in dimples of her chin \nAnd streak\u2019d her neck which quaked like curd. \nAt last the evil people \nWorn out by her resistance \nFlung back her penny kick\u2019d their fruit \nAlong whichever road they took \nNot leaving root or stone or shoot; \nSome writh\u2019d into the ground \nSome div\u2019d into the brook \nWith ring and ripple \nSome scudded on the gale without a sound \nSome vanish\u2019d in the distance. \n\nIn a smart ache tingle \nLizzie went her way; \nKnew not was it night or day; \nSprang up the bank tore thro\u2019 the furze \nThreaded copse and dingle \nAnd heard her penny jingle \nBouncing in her purse\u2014 \nIts bounce was music to her ear. \nShe ran and ran \nAs if she fear\u2019d some goblin man \nDogg\u2019d her with gibe or curse \nOr something worse: \nBut not one goblin scurried after \nNor was she prick\u2019d by fear; \nThe kind heart made her windy-paced \nThat urged her home quite out of breath with haste \nAnd inward laughter. \n\nShe cried \u201cLaura\u201d up the garden \n\u201cDid you miss me? \nCome and kiss me. \nNever mind my bruises \nHug me kiss me suck my juices \nSqueez\u2019d from goblin fruits for you \nGoblin pulp and goblin dew. \nEat me drink me love me; \nLaura make much of me; \nFor your sake I have braved the glen \nAnd had to do with goblin merchant men.\u201d \n\nLaura started from her chair \nFlung her arms up in the air \nClutch\u2019d her hair: \n\u201cLizzie Lizzie have you tasted \nFor my sake the fruit forbidden? \nMust your light like mine be hidden \nYour young life like mine be wasted \nUndone in mine undoing \nAnd ruin\u2019d in my ruin \nThirsty canker\u2019d goblin-ridden?\u201d\u2014 \nShe clung about her sister \nKiss\u2019d and kiss\u2019d and kiss\u2019d her: \nTears once again \nRefresh\u2019d her shrunken eyes \nDropping like rain \nAfter long sultry drouth; \nShaking with aguish fear and pain \nShe kiss\u2019d and kiss\u2019d her with a hungry mouth. \n\nHer lips began to scorch \nThat juice was wormwood to her tongue \nShe loath\u2019d the feast: \nWrithing as one possess\u2019d she leap\u2019d and sung \nRent all her robe and wrung \nHer hands in lamentable haste \nAnd beat her breast. \nHer locks stream\u2019d like the torch \nBorne by a racer at full speed \nOr like the mane of horses in their flight \nOr like an eagle when she stems the light \nStraight toward the sun \nOr like a caged thing freed \nOr like a flying flag when armies run. \n\nSwift fire spread through her veins knock\u2019d at her heart \nMet the fire smouldering there \nAnd overbore its lesser flame; \nShe gorged on bitterness without a name: \nAh! fool to choose such part \nOf soul-consuming care! \nSense fail\u2019d in the mortal strife: \nLike the watch-tower of a town \nWhich an earthquake shatters down \nLike a lightning-stricken mast \nLike a wind-uprooted tree \nSpun about \nLike a foam-topp\u2019d waterspout \nCast down headlong in the sea \nShe fell at last; \nPleasure past and anguish past \nIs it death or is it life? \n\nLife out of death. \nThat night long Lizzie watch\u2019d by her \nCounted her pulse\u2019s flagging stir \nFelt for her breath \nHeld water to her lips and cool\u2019d her face \nWith tears and fanning leaves: \nBut when the first birds chirp\u2019d about their eaves \nAnd early reapers plodded to the place \nOf golden sheaves \nAnd dew-wet grass \nBow\u2019d in the morning winds so brisk to pass \nAnd new buds with new day \nOpen\u2019d of cup-like lilies on the stream \nLaura awoke as from a dream \nLaugh\u2019d in the innocent old way \nHugg\u2019d Lizzie but not twice or thrice; \nHer gleaming locks show\u2019d not one thread of grey \nHer breath was sweet as May \nAnd light danced in her eyes. \n\nDays weeks months years \nAfterwards when both were wives \nWith children of their own; \nTheir mother-hearts beset with fears \nTheir lives bound up in tender lives; \nLaura would call the little ones \nAnd tell them of her early prime \nThose pleasant days long gone \nOf not-returning time: \nWould talk about the haunted glen \nThe wicked quaint fruit-merchant men \nTheir fruits like honey to the throat \nBut poison in the blood; \n(Men sell not such in any town): \nWould tell them how her sister stood \nIn deadly peril to do her good \nAnd win the fiery antidote: \nThen joining hands to little hands \nWould bid them cling together \n\u201cFor there

waking dreams;\n    What seems is not always as it seems.\n\n    I looked out of my window in the sweet new morning\n    And there I saw three barges of manifold adorning\n    Went sailing toward the East:\n    The first had sails like fire\n    The next like glittering wire\n    But sackcloth were the sails of the least;\n    And all the crews made music and two had spread a feast.\n\n    The first choir breathed in flutes\n    And fingered soft guitars;\n    The second won from lutes\n    Harmonious chords and jars\n    With drums for stormy bars:\n    But the third was all of harpers and scarlet trumpeters;\n    Notes of triumph then\n    An alarm again\n    As for onset as for victory rallies stirs\n    Peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.\n\n    The first barge showed for figurehead a Love with wings;\n    The second showed for figurehead a Worm with stings;\n    The third a Lily tangled to a Rose which clings.\n    The first bore for freight gold and spice and down;\n    The second bore a sword a sceptre and a crown;\n    The third a heap of earth gone to dust and brown.\n    Winged Love meseemed like Folly in the face;\n    Stinged Worm meseemed loathly in his place;\n    Lily and Rose were flowers of grace.\n\n    Merry went the revel of the fire-sailed crew\n    Singing feasting dancing to and fro:\n    Pleasures ever changing ever graceful ever new;\n    Sighs but scarce of woe;\n    All the sighing\n    Wooed such sweet replying;\n    All the sighing sweet and low\n    Used to come and go\n    For more pleasure merely so.\n    Yet at intervals some one grew tired\n    Of everything desired\n    And sank I knew not whither in sorry plight\n    Out of sight.\n\n    The second crew seemed ever\n    Wider-visioned graver\n    More distinct of purpose more sustained of will;\n    With heads erect and proud\n    And voices sometimes loud;\n    With endless tacking counter-tacking\n    All things grasping all things lacking\n    It would seem;\n    Ever shifting helm or sail or shroud\n    Drifting on as in a dream.\n    Hoarding to their utmost bent\n    Feasting to their fill\n    Yet gnawed by discontent\n    Envy hatred malice on their road they went.\n    Their freight was not a treasure\n    Their music not a pleasure;\n    The sword flashed cleaving through their bands\n    Sceptre and crown changed hands.\n\n    The third crew as they went\n    Seemed mostly different;\n    They toiled in rowing for to them the wind was contrary\n    As all the world might see.\n    They labored at the oar\n    While on their heads they bore\n    The fiery stress of sunshine more and more.\n    They labored at the oar hand-sore\n    Till rain went splashing\n    And spray went dashing\n    Down on them and up on them more and more.\n    Their sails were patched and rent\n    Their masts were bent\n    In peril of their lives they worked and went.\n    For them no feast was spread\n    No soft luxurious bed\n    Scented and white\n    No crown or sceptre hung in sight;\n    In weariness and painfulness\n    In thirst and sore distress\n    They rowed and steered from left to right\n    With all their might.\n    Their trumpeters and harpers round about\n    Incessantly played out\n    And sometimes they made answer with a shout;\n    But oftener they groaned or wept\n    And seldom paused to eat and seldom slept.\n    I wept for pity watching them but more\n    I wept heart-sore\n    Once and again to see\n    Some weary man plunge overboard and swim\n    To Love or Worm ship floating buoyantly:\n    And there all welcomed him.\n\n    The ships steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other\n    Yet all the crews were interchangeable;\n    Now one man now another\n    --Like bloodless spectres some some flushed by health--\n    Changed openly or changed by stealth\n    Scaling a slippery side and scaled it well.\n    The most left Love ship hauling wealth\n    Up Worm ship\u2019s side;\n    While some few hollow-eyed\n    Left either for the sack-sailed boat;\n    But this though not remote\n    Was worst to mount and whoso left it once\n    Scarce ever came again\n    But seemed to loathe his erst companions\n    And wish and work them bane.\n\n    Then I knew (I know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread\n    Rocks and reefs and whirlpools in the water-bed\n    Whence a waterspout\n    Instantaneously leaped out\n    Roaring as it reared its head.\n\n    Soon I spied a something dim\n    Many-handed grim\n    That went flitting to and fro the first and second ship;\n    It puffed their sails full out\n    With puffs of smoky breath\n    From a smouldering lip\n    And cleared the waterspout\n    Which reeled roaring round about\n    Threatening death.\n    With a horny hand it steered\n    And a horn appeared\n    On its sneering head upreared\n    Haughty and high\n    Against the blackening lowering sky.\n    With a hoof it swayed the waves;\n    They opened here and there\n    Till I spied deep ocean graves\n    Full of skeletons\n    That were men and women once\n    Foul or fair;\n    Full of things that creep\n    And fester in the deep\n    And never breathe the clean life-nurturing air.\n\n    The third bark held aloof\n    From the Monster with the hoof\n    Despite his urgent beck\n    And fraught with guile\n    Abominable his smile;\n    Till I saw him take a flying leap on to that deck.\n    Then full of awe\n    With these same eyes I saw\n    His head incredible retract its horn\n    Rounding like babe\u2019s new born\n    While silvery phosphorescence played\n    About his dis-horned head.\n    The sneer smoothed from his lip\n    He beamed blandly on the ship;\n    All winds sank to a moan\n    All waves to a monotone\n    (For all these seemed his realm)\n    While he laid a strong caressing hand upon the helm.\n\n    Then a cry well nigh of despair\n    Shrieked to heaven a clamor of desperate prayer.\n    The harpers harped no more\n    While the trumpeters sounded sore\n    An alarm to wake the dead from their bed:\n    To the rescue to the rescue now or never\n    To the rescue O ye living O ye dead\n    Or no more help or hope for ever!--\n    The planks strained as though they must part asunder\n    The masts bent as though they must dip under\n    And the winds and the waves at length\n    Girt up their strength\n    And the depths were laid bare\n    And heaven flashed fire and volleyed thunder\n    Through the rain-choked air\n    And sea and sky seemed to kiss\n    In the horror and the hiss\n    Of the whole world shuddering everywhere.\n\n    Lo! a Flyer swooping down\n    With wings to span the globe\n    And splendor for his robe\n    And splendor for his crown.\n    He lighted on the helm with a foot of fire\n    And spun the Monster overboard:\n    And that monstrous thing abhorred\n    Gnashing with balked desire\n    Wriggled like a worm infirm\n    Up the Worm\n    Of the loathly figurehead.\n    There he crouched and gnashed;\n    And his head re-horned and gashed\n    From the other\u2019s grapple dripped bloody red.\n\n    I saw that thing accurst\n    Wreak his worst\n    On the first and second crew:\n    Some with baited hook\n    He angled for and took\n    Some dragged overboard in a net he threw\n    Some he did to death\n    With hoof or horn or blasting breath.\n\n    I heard a voice of wailing\n    Where the ships went sailing\n    A sorrowful voice prevailing\n    Above the sound of the sea\n    Above the singers\u2019 voices\n    And musical merry noises;\n    All songs had turned to sighing\n    The light was failing\n    The day was dying--\n    Ah me\n    That such a sorrow should be!\n\n    There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land\n    When Love ship went down by the bottomless quicksand\n    To its grave in the bitter wave.\n    There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land\n    When Worm ship went to pieces on the rock-bound strand\n    And the bitter wave was its grave.\n    But land and sea waxed hoary\n    In whiteness of a glory\n    Never told in story\n    Nor seen by mortal eye\n    When the third ship crossed the bar\n    Where whirls and breakers are\n    And steered into the splendors of the sky;\n    That third bark and that least\n    Which had never seemed to feast\n    Yet kept high festival

infuriated bees\njealous kisses swarm down upon\nthe sweetness of the female body\nand an impatient hand grasps\nwhatever it can reach,\nand desire does not flag.\nEven death might be without terror\nat the moment of exultation.\n\nBut who has ever calculated\nhow much love goes\ninto one pair of open arms!\n\nLetters to women\nI always sent by pigeon post.\nMy conscience is clear.\nI never entrusted them to sparrowhawks\nor goshawks.\n\nUnder my pen the verses dance no longer\nand like a tear in the corner of an eye\nthe word hangs back.\nAnd all my life, at its end,\nis now only a fast journey on a train:\n\nI\u2019m standing by the window of the carriage\nand day after day\nspeeds back into yesterday\nto join the black mists of sorrow.\nAt times I helplessly catch hold\nof the emergency brake.\n\nPerhaps I shall once more catch sight\nof a woman\u2019s smile,\ntrapped like a torn-off flower\non the lashes of her eyes.\nPerhaps I may still be allowed\nto send those eyes at least one kiss\nbefore they\u2019re lost to me in the dark.\n\nPerhaps once more I shall even see\na slender ankle\nchiselled like a gem\nout of warm tenderness,\nso that I might once more\nhalf choke with longing.\n\nHow much is there that man must leave behind\nas the train inexorably approaches\nLethe Station\nwith its plantations of shimmering asphodels\namidst whose perfume everything is forgotten.\nIncluding human love.\n\nThat is the final stop:\nthe train goes no further.", "keywords": []}, "STRUGGLE WITH THE ANGEL": {"body": "God knows who first thought up\nthat gloomy image\nand spoke of the dead\nas living shades\nstraying about amongst us.\n\nAnd yet those shades are really here--\nyou can\u2019t miss them.\nOver the years I\u2019ve gathered around me\na numerous cluster.\nBut it is I amidst them all\nwho is straying.\n\nThey\u2019re dark\nand their muteness keeps time\nwith my muteness\nwhen the evening\u2019s closing in\nand I\u2019m alone.\nNow and again they stay my writing hand\nwhen I\u2019m not right,\nand blow away an evil thought\nthat\u2019s painful.\n\nSome of them are so dim\nand faded\nI\u2019m losing sight of them in the distance.\nOne of the shades, however, is rose-red\nand weeps.\nIn every person\u2019s life\nthere comes a moment\nwhen everything suddenly goes black before his eyes\nand he longs passionately to take in his hands\na smiling head.\nHis heart wants to be tied\nto another heart,\neven by deep stitches,\nwhile his lips desire nothing more\nthan to touch down on the spots where\nthe midnight raven settled on Pallas Athene\nwhen uninvited it flew in to visit\na melancholy poet.\n\nIt is called love.\nAll right,\nperhaps that\u2019s what it is!\nBut only rarely does it last for long,\nlet alone unto death\nas in the case of swans.\nOften loves succeed each other\nlike suits of cards in your hand.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s just a tremor of delight,\nmore often long and bitter pain.\nAt other times all sighs and tears.\nAnd sometimes even boredom.\nThat\u2019s the saddest kind.\n\nSome time in the past I saw a rose-red shade.\nIt stood by the entrance to a house\nfacing Prague\u2019s railway station,\neternally swathed in smoke.\n\nWe used to sit there by the window.\nI held her delicate hands\nand talked of love.\nI\u2019m good at that!\nShe\u2019s long been dead.\nThe red lights were winking\ndown by the track.\n\nAs soon as the wind sprang up a little\nit blew away the grey veil\nand the rails glistened\nlike the strings of some monstrous piano.\nAt times you could also hear the whistle of steam\nand the puffing of engines\nas they carried off people\u2019s wretched longings\nfrom the grimy platforms\nto all possible destinations.\nSometimes they also carried away the dead\nreturning to their homes\nand to their cemeteries.\n\nNow I know why it hurts so\nto tear hand from hand,\nlips from lips,\nwhen the stitches tear\nand the guard slams shut\nthe last carriage door.\n\nLove\u2019s an eternal struggle with the angel.\nFrom dawn to night.\nWithout mercy.\nThe opponent is often stronger.\nBut woe to him\nwho doesn\u2019t realize\nthat his angel has no wings\nand will not bless.", "keywords": []}}, "metadata": {"tag": "seifert", "name": "Jaroslav Seifert", "birth": "1901", "death": "1986", "nationality": "czech", "link":

A cold wind chills the beach. \nThe long lines of it grow longer, emptier, \nA darkness gathers though it does not fall \n\nAnd the whiteness grows less vivid on the wall. \nThe man who is walking turns blankly on the sand. \nHe observes how the north is always enlarging the change, \n\nWith its frigid brilliances, its blue-red sweeps \nAnd gusts of great enkindlings, its polar green, \nThe color of ice and fire and solitude. \n\n\n\tIII.\n\nFarewell to an idea . . . The mother\u2019s face, \nThe purpose of the poem, fills the room. \nThey are together, here, and it is warm, \n\nWith none of the prescience of oncoming dreams. \nIt is evening. The house is evening, half dissolved. \nOnly the half they can never possess remains, \n\nStill-starred. It is the mother they possess, \nWho gives transparence to their present peace. \nShe makes that gentler that can gentle be. \n\nAnd yet she too is dissolved, she is destroyed. \nShe gives transparence. But she has grown old. \nThe necklace is a carving not a kiss. \n\nThe soft hands are a motion not a touch. \nThe house will crumble and the books will burn. \nThey are at ease in a shelter of the mind \n\nAnd the house is of the mind and they and time, \nTogether, all together. Boreal night \nWill look like frost as it approaches them \n\nAnd to the mother as she falls asleep \nAnd as they say good-night, good-night. Upstairs \nThe windows will be lighted, not the rooms. \n\nA wind will spread its windy grandeurs round \nAnd knock like a rifle-butt against the door. \nThe wind will command them with invincible sound. \n\n\n\tIV.\n\nFarewell to an idea . . . The cancellings, \nThe negations are never final. The father sits \nIn space, wherever he sits, of bleak regard, \n\nAs one that is strong in the bushes of his eyes. \nHe says no to no and yes to yes. He says yes \nTo no; and in saying yes he says farewell. \n\nHe measures the velocities of change. \nHe leaps from heaven to heaven more rapidly \nThan bad angels leap from heaven to hell in flames. \n\nBut now he sits in quiet and green-a-day. \nHe assumes the great speeds of space and flutters them \nFrom cloud to cloudless, cloudless to keen clear \n\nIn flights of eye and ear, the highest eye \nAnd the lowest ear, the deep ear that discerns, \nAt evening, things that attend it until it hears \n\nThe supernatural preludes of its own, \nAt the moment when the angelic eye defines \nIts actors approaching, in company, in their masks. \n\nMaster O master seated by the fire \nAnd yet in space and motionless and yet \nOf motion the ever-brightening origin, \n\nProfound, and yet the king and yet the crown, \nLook at this present throne. What company, \nIn masks, can choir it with the naked wind? \n\n\n\tV. \n\nThe mother invites humanity to her house \nAnd table. The father fetches tellers of tales \nAnd musicians who mute much, muse much, on the tales. \n\nThe father fetches negresses to dance, \nAmong the children, like curious ripenesses \nOf pattern in the dance\u2019s ripening. \n\nFor these the musicians make insidious tones, \nClawing the sing-song of their instruments. \nThe children laugh and jangle a tinny time. \n\nThe father fetches pageants out of air, \nScenes of the theatre, vistas and blocks of woods \nAnd curtains like a naive pretence of sleep. \n\nAmong these the musicians strike the instinctive poem. \nThe father fetches his unherded herds, \nOf barbarous tongue, slavered and panting halves \n\nOf breath, obedient to his trumpet\u2019s touch. \nThis then is Chatillon or as you please. \nWe stand in the tumult of a festival. \n\nWhat festival? This loud, disordered mooch? \nThese hospitaliers? These brute-like guests? \nThese musicians dubbing at a tragedy, \n\nA-dub, a-dub, which is made up of this: \nThat there are no lines to speak? There is no play. \nOr, the persons act one merely by being here. \n\n\n\tVI.\n\nIt is a theatre floating through the clouds, \nItself a cloud, although of misted rock \nAnd mountains running like water, wave on wave, \n\nThrough waves of light. It is of cloud transformed \nTo cloud transformed again, idly, the way \nA season changes color to no end, \n\nExcept the lavishing of itself in change, \nAs light changes yellow into gold and gold \nTo its opal elements and fire\u2019s delight, \n\nSplashed wide-wise because it likes magnificence \nAnd the solemn pleasures of magnificent space \nThe cloud drifts idly through half-thought-of forms. \n\nThe theatre is filled with flying birds, \nWild wedges, as of a volcano\u2019s smoke, palm-eyed \nAnd vanishing, a web in a corridor \n\nOr massive portico. A capitol, \nIt may be, is emerging or has just \nCollapsed. The denouement has to be postponed . . . \n\nThis is nothing until in a single man contained, \nNothing until this named thing nameless is \nAnd is destroyed. He opens the door of his house \n\nOn flames. The scholar of one candle sees \nAn Arctic effulgence flaring on the frame \nOf everything he is. And he feels afraid.\n\n\n\tVII.\n\nIs there an imagination that sits enthroned \nAs grim as it is benevolent, the just \nAnd the unjust, which in the midst of summer stops \n\nTo imagine winter? When the leaves are dead, \nDoes it take its place in the north and enfold itself, \nGoat-leaper, crystalled and luminous, sitting \n\nIn highest night? And do these heavens adorn \nAnd proclaim it, the white creator of black, jetted \nBy extinguishings, even of planets as may be, \n\nEven of earth, even of sight, in snow, \nExcept as needed by way of majesty, \nIn the sky, as crown and diamond cabala?\n\nIt leaps through us, through all our heavens leaps, \nExtinguishing our planets, one by one, \nLeaving, of where we were and looked, of where \n\nWe knew each other and of each other thought, \nA shivering residue, chilled and foregone, \nExcept for that crown and mystical cabala. \n\nBut it dare not leap by chance in its own dark. \nIt must change from destiny to slight caprice. \nAnd thus its jetted tragedy, its stele \n\nAnd shape and mournful making move to find \nWhat must unmake it and, at last, what can, \nSay, a flippant communication under the moon. \n\n\n\tVIII.\n\nThere may be always a time of innocence. \nThere is never a place. Or if there is no time, \nIf it is not a thing of time, nor of place, \n\nExisting in the idea of it, alone, \nIn the sense against calamity, it is not \nLess real. For the oldest and coldest philosopher, \n\nThere is or may be a time of innocence \nAs pure principle. Its nature is its end, \nThat it should be, and yet not be, a thing \n\nThat pinches the pity of the pitiful man, \nLike a book at evening beautiful but untrue, \nLike a book on rising beautiful and true. \n\n\nIt is like a thing of ether that exists \nAlmost as predicate. But it exists, \nIt exists, it is visible, it is, it is. \n\nSo, then, these lights are not a spell of light, \nA saying out of a cloud, but innocence. \nAn innocence of the earth and no false sign \n\nOr symbol of malice. That we partake thereof, \nLie down like children in this holiness, \nAs if, awake, we lay in the quiet of sleep, \n\nAs if the innocent mother sang in the dark \nOf the room and on an accordion, half-heard, \nCreated the time and place in which we breathed . . . \n\n\n\tIX.\n\nAnd of each other thought\u2014in the idiom \nOf the work, in the idiom of an innocent earth, \nNot of the enigma of the guilty dream. \n\nWe were as Danes in Denmark all day long \nAnd knew each other well, hale-hearted landsmen, \nFor whom the outlandish was another day \n\nOf the week, queerer than Sunday. We thought alike \nAnd that made brothers of us in a home \nIn which we fed on being brothers, fed \n\nAnd fattened as on a decorous honeycomb. \nThis drama that we live\u2014We lay sticky with sleep. \nThis sense of the activity of fate\u2014-\n\nThe rendezvous, when she came alone, \nBy her coming became a freedom of the two, \nAn isolation which only the two could share. \n\nShall we be found hanging in the trees next spring? \nOf what disaster in this the imminence: \nBare limbs, bare trees and a wind as sharp as salt? \n\nThe stars are putting on their glittering belts. \nThey throw around their shoulders cloaks that flash \nLike a great shadow\u2019s last embellishment. \n\nIt may come tomorrow in the simplest word, \nAlmost as part of innocence, almost, \nAlmost as the tenderest and the truest part. \n\n\n\tX.\n\nAn unhappy people in a happy world--\nRead, rabbi, the phases of this difference. \nAn unhappy people in an unhappy world--\n\nHere are too many mirrors for misery. \nA happy people in an unhappy world--\nIt cannot be. There\u2019s nothing there to roll \n\nOn the expressive tongue, the finding fang. \nA happy people in a happy world--\nBuffo! A ball, an opera, a bar. \n\nTurn back to where we were when we began: \nAn unhappy people in a happy world. \nNow, solemnize the secretive syllables. \n\nRead to the congregation, for today \nAnd for tomorrow, this extremity, \nThis contrivance of the spectre of the spheres, \n\nContriving balance to contrive a whole, \nThe vital, the never-failing genius, \nFulfilling his meditations, great and small. \n\nIn these unhappy he meditates a whole, \nThe full of fortune and the full of fate, \nAs if he lived all lives, that he might know, \n\nIn hall harridan, not hushful paradise, \nTo a

decay;\n     Doubts to the world\u2019s child-heart unknown\n     Question us now from star and stone;\n     Too little or too much we know,\n     And sight is swift and faith is slow;\n     The power is lost to self-deceive\n     With shallow forms of make-believe.\n     W e walk at high noon, and the bells\n     Call to a thousand oracles,\n     But the sound deafens, and the light\n     Is stronger than our dazzled sight;\n     The letters of the sacred Book\n     Glimmer and swim beneath our look;\n     Still struggles in the Age\u2019s breast\n     With deepening agony of quest\n     The old entreaty: \u2018Art thou He,\n     Or look we for the Christ to be?\u2019\n\n     \u201cGod should be most where man is least\n     So, where is neither church nor priest,\n     And never rag of form or creed\n     To clothe the nakedness of need,--\n     Where farmer-folk in silence meet,--\n     I turn my bell-unsummoned feet;\u2019\n     I lay the critic\u2019s glass aside,\n     I tread upon my lettered pride,\n     And, lowest-seated, testify\n     To the oneness of humanity;\n     Confess the universal want,\n     And share whatever Heaven may grant.\n     He findeth not who seeks his own,\n     The soul is lost that\u2019s saved alone.\n     Not on one favored forehead fell\n     Of old the fire-tongued miracle,\n     But flamed o\u2019er all the thronging host\n     The baptism of the Holy Ghost;\n     Heart answers heart: in one desire\n     The blending lines of prayer aspire;\n     \u2018Where, in my name, meet two or three,\u2019\n     Our Lord hath said, \u2018I there will be!\u2019\n\n     \u201cSo sometimes comes to soul and sense\n     The feeling which is evidence\n     That very near about us lies\n     The realm of spiritual mysteries.\n     The sphere of the supernal powers\n     Impinges on this world of ours.\n     The low and dark horizon lifts,\n     To light the scenic terror shifts;\n     The breath of a diviner air\n     Blows down the answer of a prayer\n     That all our sorrow, pain, and doubt\n     A great compassion clasps about,\n     And law and goodness, love and force,\n     Are wedded fast beyond divorce.\n     Then duty leaves to love its task,\n     The beggar Self forgets to ask;\n     With smile of trust and folded hands,\n     The passive soul in waiting stands\n     To feel, as flowers the sun and dew,\n     The One true Life its own renew.\n\n     \u201cSo, to the calmly gathered thought\n     The innermost of truth is taught,\n     The mystery dimly understood,\n     That love of God is love of good,\n     And, chiefly, its divinest trace\n     In Him of Nazareth\u2019s holy face;\n     That to be saved is only this,--\n     Salvation from our selfishness,\n     From more than elemental fire,\n     The soul\u2019s unsanetified desire,\n     From sin itself, and not the pain\n     That warns us of its chafing chain;\n     That worship\u2019s deeper meaning lies\n     In mercy, and not sacrifice,\n     Not proud humilities of sense\n     And posturing of penitence,\n     But love\u2019s unforced obedience;\n     That Book and Church and Day are given\n     For man, not God,--for earth, not heaven,--\n     The blessed means to holiest ends,\n     Not masters, but benignant friends;\n     That the dear Christ dwells not afar,\n     The king of some remoter star,\n     Listening, at times, with flattered ear\n     To homage wrung from selfish fear,\n     But here, amidst the poor and blind,\n     The bound and suffering of our kind,\n     In works we do, in prayers we pray,\n     Life of our life, He lives to-day.\u201d", "keywords": []}, "THE CLEAR VISION": {"body": "     I did but dream.

Can prayer\n     Reach the shut ear of Fate, or move\n     Unpitying Energy to spare?\n     What doth the cosmic Vastness care?\n\n     In vain to this dread Unconcern\n     For the All-Father\u2019s love we look;\n     In vain, in quest of it, we turn\n     The storied leaves of Nature\u2019s book,\n     The prints her rocky tablets took.\n\n     I pray for faith, I long to trust;\n     I listen with my heart, and hear\n     A Voice without a sound: \u201cBe just,\n     Be true, be merciful, revere\n     The Word within thee: God is near!\n\n     \u201cA light to sky and earth unknown\n     Pales all their lights: a mightier force\n     Than theirs the powers of Nature own,\n     And, to its goal as at its source,\n     His Spirit moves the Universe.\n\n     \u201cBelieve and trust. Through stars and suns,\n     Through life and death, through soul and sense,\n     His wise, paternal purpose runs;\n     The darkness of His providence\n     Is star-lit with benign intents.\u201d\n\n     O joy supreme! I know the Voice,\n     Like none beside on earth or sea;\n     Yea, more, O soul of mine, rejoice,\n     By all that He requires of me,\n     I know what God himself must be.\n\n     No picture to my aid I call,\n     I shape no image in my prayer;\n     I only know in Him is all\n     Of life, light, beauty, everywhere,\n     Eternal Goodness here and there!\n\n     I know He is, and what He is,\n     Whose one great purpose is the good\n     Of all. I rest my soul on His\n     Immortal Love and Fatherhood;\n     And trust Him, as His children should.\n\n     I fear no more. The clouded face\n     Of Nature smiles; through all her things\n     Of time and space and sense I trace\n     The moving of the Spirit\u2019s wings,\n     And hear the song of hope she sings.\n\n     1886", "keywords": []}}, "metadata": {"tag": "whittier", "name": "John Greenleaf Whittier", "birth": "1807", "death": "1892", "nationality": "american", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Greenleaf_Whittier"}}, "wilbur": {"poems": {"ADVICE TO A PROPHET": {"body": "When you come, as you soon must, to the streets of our city,   \nMad-eyed from stating the obvious,\nNot proclaiming our fall but begging us\nIn God\u2019s name to have self-pity,\n\nSpare us all word of the weapons, their force and range,   \nThe long numbers that rocket the mind;\nOur slow, unreckoning hearts will be left behind,   \nUnable to fear what is too strange.\n\nNor shall you scare us with talk of the death of the race.   \nHow should we dream of this place without us?\u2014\nThe sun mere fire, the leaves untroubled about us,   \nA stone look on the stone\u2019s face?\n\nSpeak of the world\u2019s own change.

\n\nI thought of Chatterton, the marvellous Boy, \nThe sleepless Soul that perished in his pride; \nOf Him who walked in glory and in joy \nFollowing his plough, along the mountain-side: \nBy our own spirits are we deified: \nWe Poets in our youth begin in gladness; \nBut thereof come in the end despondency and madness. \n\nNow, whether it were by peculiar grace, \nA leading from above, a something given, \nYet it befell that, in this lonely place, \nWhen I with these untoward thoughts had striven, \nBeside a pool bare to the eye of heaven \nI saw a Man before me unawares: \nThe oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs. \n\nAs a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie \nCouched on the bald top of an eminence; \nWonder to all who do the same espy, \nBy what means it could thither come, and whence; \nSo that it seems a thing endued with sense: \nLike a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf \nOf rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself; \n\nSuch seemed this Man, not all alive nor dead, \nNor all asleep--in his extreme old age: \nHis body was bent double, feet and head \nComing together in life\u2019s pilgrimage; \nAs if some dire constraint of pain, or rage \nOf sickness felt by him in times long past, \nA more than human weight upon his frame had cast. \n\nHimself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face, \nUpon a long grey staff of shaven wood: \nAnd, still as I drew near with gentle pace, \nUpon the margin of that moorish flood \nMotionless as a cloud the old Man stood, \nThat heareth not the loud winds when they call, \nAnd moveth all together, if it move at all. \n\nAt length, himself unsettling, he the pond \nStirred with his staff, and fixedly did look \nUpon the muddy water, which he conned, \nAs if he had been reading in a book: \nAnd now a stranger\u2019s privilege I took; \nAnd, drawing to his side, to him did say, \n\u201cThis morning gives us promise of a glorious day.\u201c \n\nA gentle answer did the old Man make, \nIn courteous speech which forth he slowly drew: \nAnd him with further words I thus bespake, \n\u201cWhat occupation do you there pursue?
