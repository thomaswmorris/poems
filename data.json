Below\nThe iron ice stung like a goad,\nSlashing the torn shoes from my feet,\nAnd all the air was bitter sleet.\n\nAnd all the land was cramped with snow,\nSteel-strong and fierce and glimmering wan,\nLike pale plains of obsidian.\n--And yet I strove--and I was fire\nAnd ice--and fire and ice were one\nIn one vast hunger of desire.\nA dim desire, of pleasant places,\nAnd lush fields in the summer sun,\nAnd logs aflame, and walls, and faces,\n--And wine, and old ambrosial talk,\nA golden ball in fountains dancing,\nAnd unforgotten hands. (Ah, God,\nI trod them down where I have trod,\nAnd they remain, and they remain,\nEtched in unutterable pain,\nLoved lips and faces now apart,\nThat once were closer than my heart--\nIn agony, in agony,\nAnd horribly a part of me . . .\nFor Lethe is for no man set,\nAnd in Hell may no man forget.)\n\nAnd there were flowers, and jugs, bright-glancing,\nAnd old Italian swords--and looks,\nA moment\u2019s glance of fire, of fire,\nSpiring, leaping, flaming higher,\nInto the intense, the cloudless blue,\nUntil two souls were one, and flame,\nAnd very flesh, and yet the same!\nAs if all springs were crushed anew\nInto one globed drop of dew!\nBut for the most I thought of heat,\nDesiring greatly . . . Hot white sand\nThe lazy body lies at rest in,\nOr sun-dried, scented grass to nest in,\nAnd fires, innumerable fires,\nGreat fagots hurling golden gyres\nOf sparks far up, and the red heart\nIn sea-coals, crashing as they part\nTo tiny flares, and kindling snapping,\nBunched sticks that burst their string and wrapping\nAnd fall like jackstraws; green and blue\nThe evil flames of driftwood too,\nAnd heavy, sullen lumps of coke\nWith still, fierce heat and ugly smoke. . . .\n. . . And then the vision of his face,\nAnd theirs, all theirs, came like a sword,\nThrice, to the heart--and as I fell\nI thought I saw a light before.\n\nI woke. My hands were blue and sore,\nTorn on the ice. I scarcely felt\nThe frozen sleet begin to melt\nUpon my face as I breathed deeper,\nBut lay there warmly, like a sleeper\nWho shifts his arm once, and moans low,\nAnd then sinks back to night. Slow, slow,\nAnd still as Death, came Sleep and Death\nAnd looked at me with quiet breath.\nUnbending figures, black and stark\nAgainst the intense deeps of the dark.\nTall and like trees. Like sweet and fire\nRest crept and crept along my veins,\nGently. And there were no more pains . . .\n\nWas it not better so to lie?\nThe fight was done. Even gods tire\nOf fighting . . . My way was the wrong.\nNow I should drift and drift along\nTo endless quiet, golden peace . . .\nAnd let the tortured body cease.\n\nAnd then a light winked like an eye.\n. . . And very many miles away\nA girl stood at a warm, lit door,\nHolding a lamp. Ray upon ray\nIt cloaked the snow with perfect light.\nAnd where she was there was no night\nNor could be, ever. God is sure,\nAnd in his hands are things secure.\nIt is not given me to trace\nThe lovely laughter of that face,\nLike a clear brook most full of light,\nOr olives swaying on a height,\nSo silver they have wings, almost;\nLike a great word once known and lost\nAnd meaning all things.

So. Would it mend\nIf I shrank back before the end?\nAnd sank to death and cowardice?\nNo, the last lees must be drained up,\nBase wine from an ignoble cup;\n(Yet not so base as sleek content\nWhen I had shrunk from punishment)\nThe wretched body strain anew!\nLife was a storm to wander through.\nI took the wrong way. Good and well,\nAt least my feet sought out not Hell!\nThough night were one consuming flame\nI must go on for my base aim,\nAnd so, perhaps, make evil grow\nTo something clean by agony . . .\nAnd reach that light upon the snow . . .\nAnd touch her dress at last . . .\nSo, so,\nI crawled. I could not speak or see\nSave dimly. The ice glared like fire,\nA long bright Hell of choking cold,\nAnd each vein was a tautened wire,\nThrobbing with torture--and I crawled.\nMy hands were wounds.\nSo I attained\nThe second Hell. The snow was stained\nI thought, and shook my head at it\nHow red it was!

It was no abyss \nthat lay before me, but only the level ground. \n\n\n\tIII.\n\nSometimes our life reminds me \nof a forest in which there is a graceful clearing \nand in that opening a house, \nan orchard and garden, \ncomfortable shades, and flowers \nred and yellow in the sun, a pattern \nmade in the light for the light to return to. \nThe forest is mostly dark, its ways \nto be made anew day after day, the dark \nricher than the light and more blessed, \nprovided we stay brave \nenough to keep on going in. \n\n\n\tIV.\n\nHow many times have I come to you out of my head \nwith joy, if ever a man was, \nfor to approach you I have given up the light \nand all directions.

There was a maid,\nThe fairest of the Indian maids, bright-eyed,\nWith wealth of raven tresses, a light form,\nAnd a gay heart. About her cabin-door\nThe wide old woods resounded with her song\nAnd fairy laughter all the summer day.\nShe loved her cousin; such a love was deemed,\nBy the morality of those stern tribes,\nIncestuous, and she struggled hard and long\nAgainst her love, and reasoned with her heart,\nAs simple Indian maiden might. In vain.\nThen her eye lost its lustre, and her step\nIts lightness, and the gray-haired men that passed\nHer dwelling, wondered that they heard no more\nThe accustomed song and laugh of her, whose looks\nWere like the cheerful smile of Spring, they said,\nUpon the Winter of their age. She went\nTo weep where no eye saw, and was not found\nWhen all the merry girls were met to dance,\nAnd all the hunters of the tribe were out;\nNor when they gathered from the rustling husk\nThe shining ear; nor when, by the river\u2019s side,\nThay pulled the grape and startled the wild shades\nWith sounds of mirth. The keen-eyed Indian dames\nWould whisper to each other, as they saw\nHer wasting form, and say _the girl will die_.\n\n  One day into the bosom of a friend,\nA playmate of her young and innocent years,\nShe poured her griefs. \u201cThou know\u2019st, and thou alone,\u201d\nShe said, \u201cfor I have told thee, all my love,\nAnd guilt, and sorrow. I am sick of life.\nAll night I weep in darkness, and the morn\nGlares on me, as upon a thing accursed,\nThat has no business on the earth. I hate\nThe pastimes and the pleasant toils that once\nI loved; the cheerful voices of my friends\nHave an unnatural horror in mine ear.\nIn dreams my mother, from the land of souls,\nCalls me and chides me. All that look on me\nDo seem to know my shame; I cannot bear\nTheir eyes; I cannot from my heart root out\nThe love that wrings it so, and I must die.\u201d\n\n  It was a summer morning, and they went\nTo this old precipice. About the cliffs\nLay garlands, ears of maize, and shaggy skins\nOf wolf and bear, the offerings of the tribe\nHere made to the Great Spirit, for they deemed,\nLike worshippers of the elder time, that God\nDoth walk on the high places and affect\nThe earth-o\u2019erlooking mountains. She had on\nThe ornaments with which her father loved\nTo deck the beauty of his bright-eyed girl,\nAnd bade her wear when stranger warriors came\nTo be his guests.

Thenceforward all who passed,\nHunter, and dame, and virgin, laid a stone\nIn silence on the pile.

The sunshine on my path\nWas to me as a friend.

Nor was I slow to come\nAmong them, when the clouds, from their still skirts,\nHad shaken down on earth the feathery snow,\nAnd all was white. The pure keen air abroad,\nAlbeit it breathed no scent of herb, nor heard\nLove-call of bird, nor merry hum of bee,\nWas not the air of death.

The mighty woods\nAre still again, the frighted bird comes back\nAnd plumes her wings; but thy sweet waters run\nCrimson with blood. Then, as the sun goes down,\nAmid the deepening twilight I descry\nFigures of men that crouch and creep unheard,\nAnd bear away the dead. The next day\u2019s shower\nShall wash the tokens of the fight away.\n\n  I look again--a hunter\u2019s lodge is built,\nWith poles and boughs, beside thy crystal well,\nWhile the meek autumn stains the woods with gold,\nAnd sheds his golden sunshine. To the door\nThe red man slowly drags the enormous bear\nSlain in the chestnut thicket, or flings down\nThe deer from his strong shoulders. Shaggy fells\nOf wolf and cougar hang upon the walls,\nAnd loud the black-eyed Indian maidens laugh,\nThat gather, from the rustling heaps of leaves,\nThe hickory\u2019s white nuts, and the dark fruit\nThat falls from the gray butternut\u2019s long boughs.\n\n  So centuries passed by, and still the woods\nBlossomed in spring, and reddened when the year\nGrew chill, and glistened in the frozen rains\nOf winter, till the white man swung the axe\nBeside thee--signal of a mighty change.\nThen all around was heard the crash of trees,\nTrembling awhile and rushing to the ground,\nThe low of ox, and shouts of men who fired\nThe brushwood, or who tore the earth with ploughs.\nThe grain sprang thick and tall, and hid in green\nThe blackened hill-side; ranks of spiky maize\nRose like a host embattled; the buckwheat\nWhitened broad acres, sweetening with its flowers\nThe August wind. White cottages were seen\nWith rose-trees at the windows; barns from which\nCame loud and shrill the crowing of the cock;\nPastures where rolled and neighed the lordly horse,\nAnd white flocks browsed and bleated. A rich turf\nOf grasses brought from far o\u2019ercrept thy bank,\nSpotted with the white clover. Blue-eyed girls\nBrought pails, and dipped them in thy crystal pool;\nAnd children, ruddy-cheeked and flaxen-haired,\nGathered the glistening cowslip from thy edge.\n\n  Since then, what steps have trod thy border! Here\nOn thy green bank, the woodmann of the swamp\nHas laid his axe, the reaper of the hill\nHis sickle, as they stooped to taste thy stream.\nThe sportsman, tired with wandering in the still\nSeptember noon, has bathed his heated brow\nIn thy cool current. Shouting boys, let loose\nFor a wild holiday, have quaintly shaped\nInto a cup the folded linden leaf,\nAnd dipped thy sliding crystal. From the wars\nReturning, the plumed soldier by thy side\nHas sat, and mused how pleasant \u2018twere to dwell\nIn such a spot, and be as free as thou,\nAnd move for no man\u2019s bidding more. At eve,\nWhen thou wert crimson with the crimson sky,\nLovers have gazed upon thee, and have thought\nTheir mingled lives should flow as peacefully\nAnd brightly as thy waters. Here the sage,\nGazing into thy self-replenished depth,\nHas seen eternal order circumscribe\nAnd bind the motions of eternal change,\nAnd from the gushing of thy simple fount\nHas reasoned to the mighty universe.\n\n  Is there no other change for thee, that lurks\nAmong the future ages? Will not man\nSeek out strange arts to wither and deform\nThe pleasant landscape which thou makest green?\nOr shall the veins that feed thy constant stream\nBe choked in middle earth, and flow no more\nFor ever, that the water-plants along\nThy channel perish, and the bird in vain\nAlight to drink? Haply shall these green hills\nSink, with the lapse of years, into the gulf\nOf ocean waters, and thy source be lost\nAmidst the bitter brine?

Not in vain to them were sent\nSeed-time and harvest, or the vernal shower\nThat darkened the brown tilth, or snow that beat\nOn the white winter hills. Each brought, in turn,\nSome truth, some lesson on the life of man,\nOr recognition of the Eternal mind\nWho veils his glory with the elements.\n\n  One such I knew long since, a white-haired man,\nPithy of speech, and merry when he would;\nA genial optimist, who daily drew\nFrom what he saw his quaint moralities.\nKindly he held communion, though so old,\nWith me a dreaming boy, and taught me much\nThat books tell not, and I shall ne\u2019er forget.\n\n  The sun of May was bright in middle heaven,\nAnd steeped the sprouting forests, the green hills\nAnd emerald wheat-fields, in his yellow light.\nUpon the apple-tree, where rosy buds\nStood clustered, ready to burst forth in bloom,\nThe robin warbled forth his full clear note\nFor hours, and wearied not. Within the woods,\nWhose young and half transparent leaves scarce cast\nA shade, gay circles of anemones\nDanced on their stalks; the shadbush, white with flowers,\nBrightened the glens; the new-leaved butternut\nAnd quivering poplar to the roving breeze\nGave a balsamic fragrance. In the fields\nI saw the pulses of the gentle wind\nOn the young grass. My heart was touched with joy\nAt so much beauty, flushing every hour\nInto a fuller beauty; but my friend,\nThe thoughtful ancient, standing at my side,\nGazed on it mildly sad. I asked him why.\n\n  \u201cWell mayst thou join in gladness,\u201c he replied,\n\u201cWith the glad earth, her springing plants and flowers,\nAnd this soft wind, the herald of the green\nLuxuriant summer. Thou art young like them,\nAnd well mayst thou rejoice. But while the flight\nOf seasons fills and knits thy spreading frame,\nIt withers mine, and thins my hair, and dims\nThese eyes, whose fading light shall soon be quenched\nIn utter darkness. Hearest thou that bird?\u201d\n\n  I listened, and from midst the depth of woods\nHeard the love-signal of the grouse, that wears\nA sable ruff around his mottled neck;\nPartridge they call him by our northern streams,\nAnd pheasant by the Delaware. He beat\n\u2018Gainst his barred sides his speckled wings, and made\nA sound like distant thunder; slow the strokes\nAt first, then fast and faster, till at length\nThey passed into a murmur and were still.\n\n  \u201cThere hast thou,\u201c said my friend, \u201ca fitting type\nOf human life. \u2018Tis an old truth, I know,\nBut images like these revive the power\nOf long familiar truths. Slow pass our days\nIn childhood, and the hours of light are long\nBetwixt the morn and eve; with swifter lapse\nThey glide in manhood, and in age they fly;\nTill days and seasons flit before the mind\nAs flit the snow-flakes in a winter storm,\nSeen rather than distinguished. Ah! I seem\nAs if I sat within a helpless bark\nBy swiftly running waters hurried on\nTo shoot some mighty cliff. Along the banks\nGrove after grove, rock after frowning rock,\nBare sands and pleasant homes, and flowery nooks,\nAnd isles and whirlpools in the stream, appear\nEach after each, but the devoted skiff\nDarts by so swiftly that their images\nDwell not upon the mind, or only dwell\nIn dim confusion; faster yet I sweep\nBy other banks, and the great gulf is near.\n\n  \u201cWisely, my son, while yet thy days are long,\nAnd this fair change of seasons passes slow,\nGather and treasure up the good they yield--\nAll that they teach of virtue, of pure thoughts\nAnd kind affections, reverence for thy God\nAnd for thy brethren; so when thou shalt come\nInto these barren years, thou mayst not bring\nA mind unfurnished and a withered heart.\u201d\n\n  Long since that white-haired ancient slept--but still,\nWhen the red flower-buds crowd the orchard bough,\nAnd the ruffed grouse is drumming far within\nThe woods, his venerable form again\nIs at my side, his voice is in my ear.", "keywords": ["may"]}, "AN EVENING REVERY": {"body": "  The summer day is closed--the sun is set:\nWell they have done their office, those bright hours,\nThe latest of whose train goes softly out\nIn the red West.

\nAnd where the troubled dwell, \nThy witching charms wean them of half their cares; \nAnd from thy sunny spell, \nThey greet joy unawares. \n\nThen with thy sultry locks all loose and rude, \nAnd mantle laced with gems of garish light, \nCome as of wont;

\nBut joys which soothe, and not distract the ears, \nThat one at leisure meets \nIn the green woods, and meadows summer-shorn, \nOr fields, where bee-fly greets \nThe ear with mellow horn. \n\nThe green-swathed grasshopper, on treble pipe, \nSings there, and dances, in mad-hearted pranks; \nThere bees go courting every flower that\u2019s ripe, \nOn baulks and sunny banks; \nAnd droning dragon-fly, on rude bassoon, \nAttempts to give God thanks \nIn no discordant tune. \n\nThe speckled thrush, by self-delight embued, \nThere sings unto himself for joy\u2019s amends, \nAnd drinks the honey dew of solitude. \nThere Happiness attends \nWith inbred Joy until the heart o\u2019erflow, \nOf which the world\u2019s rude friends, \nNought heeding, nothing know. \n\nThere the gay river, laughing as it goes, \nPlashes with easy wave its flaggy sides, \nAnd to the calm of heart, in calmness shows \nWhat pleasure there abides, \nTo trace its sedgy banks, from trouble free: \nSpots Solitude provides \nTo muse, and happy be. \n\nThere ruminating \u2018neath some pleasant bush, \nOn sweet silk grass I stretch me at mine ease, \nWhere I can pillow on the yielding rush; \nAnd, acting as I please, \nDrop into pleasant dreams; or musing lie, \nMark the wind-shaken trees, \nAnd cloud-betravelled sky. \n\nThere think me how some barter joy for care, \nAnd waste life\u2019s summer-health in riot rude, \nOf nature, nor of nature\u2019s sweets aware. \nWhen passions vain intrude, \nThese, by calm musings, softened are and still; \nAnd the heart\u2019s better mood \nFeels sick of doing ill. \n\nThere I can live, and at my leisure seek \nJoys far from cold restraints--not fearing pride-- \nFree as the winds, that breathe upon my cheek \nRude health, so long denied. \nHere poor Integrity can sit at ease, \nAnd list self-satisfied \nThe song of honey-bees. \n\nThe green lane now I traverse, where it goes \nNought guessing, till some sudden turn espies \nRude batter\u2019d finger post, that stooping shows \nWhere the snug mystery lies; \nAnd then a mossy spire, with ivy crown, \nCheers up the short surprise, \nAnd shows a peeping town. \n\nI see the wild flowers, in their summer morn \nOf beauty, feeding on joy\u2019s luscious hours; \nThe gay convolvulus, wreathing round the thorn, \nAgape for honey showers; \nAnd slender kingcup, burnished with the dew \nOf morning\u2019s early hours, \nLike gold yminted new. \n\nAnd mark by rustic bridge, o\u2019er shallow stream, \nCow-tending boy, to toil unreconciled, \nAbsorbed as in some vagrant summer dream; \nWho now, in gestures wild, \nStarts dancing to his shadow on the wall, \nFeeling self-gratified, \nNor fearing human thrall. \n\nOr thread the sunny valley laced with streams, \nOr forests rude, and the o\u2019ershadow\u2019d brims \nOf simple ponds, where idle shepherd dreams, \nStretching his listless limbs; \nOr trace hay-scented meadows, smooth and long, \nWhere joy\u2019s wild impulse swims \nIn one continued song. \n\nI love at early morn, from new mown swath, \nTo see the startled frog his route pursue; \nTo mark while, leaping o\u2019er the dripping path, \nHis bright sides scatter dew, \nThe early lark that from its bustle flies, \nTo hail his matin new; \nAnd watch him to the skies. \n\nTo note on hedgerow baulks, in moisture sprent, \nThe jetty snail creep from the mossy thorn, \nWith earnest heed, and tremulous intent, \nFrail brother of the morn, \nThat from the tiny bent\u2019s dew-misted leaves \nWithdraws his timid horn, \nAnd fearful vision weaves. \n\nOr swallow heed on smoke-tanned chimney top, \nWont to be first unsealing Morning\u2019s eye, \nEre yet the bee hath gleaned one wayward drop \nOf honey on his thigh; \nTo see him seek morn\u2019s airy couch to sing, \nUntil the golden sky \nBepaint his russet wing. \n\nOr sauntering boy by tanning corn to spy, \nWith clapping noise to startle birds away, \nAnd hear him bawl to every passer by \nTo know the hour of day; \nWhile the uncradled breezes, fresh and strong, \nWith waking blossoms play, \nAnd breathe \u00c6olian song. \n\nI love the south-west wind, or low or loud, \nAnd not the less when sudden drops of rain \nMoisten my glowing cheek from ebon cloud, \nThreatening soft showers again, \nThat over lands new ploughed and meadow grounds, \nSummer\u2019s sweet breath unchain, \nAnd wake harmonious sounds. \n\nRich music breathes in Summer\u2019s every sound; \nAnd in her harmony of varied greens, \nWoods, meadows, hedge-rows, corn-fields, all around \nMuch beauty intervenes, \nFilling with harmony the ear and eye; \nWhile o\u2019er the mingling scenes \nFar spreads the laughing sky. \n\nSee, how the wind-enamoured aspen leaves \nTurn up their silver lining to the sun! \nAnd hark! the rustling noise, that oft deceives, \nAnd makes the sheep-boy run: \nThe sound so mimics fast-approaching showers, \nHe thinks the rain\u2019s begun, \nAnd hastes to sheltering bowers. \n\nBut now the evening curdles dank and grey, \nChanging her watchet hue for sombre weed; \nAnd moping owls, to close the lids of day, \nOn drowsy wing proceed; \nWhile chickering crickets, tremulous and long, \nLight\u2019s farewell inly heed, \nAnd give it parting song. \n\nThe pranking bat its flighty circlet makes; \nThe glow-worm burnishes its lamp anew; \nO\u2019er meadows dew-besprent, the beetle wakes \nInquiries ever new, \nTeazing each passing ear with murmurs vain, \nAs wanting to pursue \nHis homeward path again. \n\nHark! \u2018tis the melody of distant bells \nThat on the wind with pleasing hum rebounds \nBy fitful starts, then musically swells \nO\u2019er the dim stilly grounds; \nWhile on the meadow-bridge the pausing boy \nListens the mellow sounds, \nAnd hums in vacant joy. \n\nNow homeward-bound, the hedger bundles round \nHis evening faggot, and with every stride \nHis leathern doublet leaves a rustling sound, \nTill silly sheep beside \nHis path start tremulous, and once again \nLook back dissatisfied, \nAnd scour the dewy plain. \n\nHow sweet the soothing calmness that distills \nO\u2019er the heart\u2019s every sense its opiate dews, \nIn meek-eyed moods and ever balmy trills! \nThat softens and subdues, \nWith gentle Quiet\u2019s bland and sober train, \nWhich dreamy eve renews \nIn many a mellow strain! \n\nI love to walk the fields, they are to me \nA legacy no evil can destroy; \nThey, like a spell, set every rapture free \nThat cheer\u2019d me when a boy. \nPlay--pastime--all Time\u2019s blotting pen conceal\u2019d, \nComes like a new-born joy, \nTo greet me in the field. \n\nFor Nature\u2019s objects ever harmonize \nWith emulous Taste, that vulgar deed annoys;

Impenetrable.\nIf there is order in all that anarchy\nOf granite mezzotint, that wilderness,\nIt takes a better eye than mine to see it.\nIt set me on to wondering how to deal\nWith such a thickness of particulars,\nDeal with it faithfully, you understand,\nWithout blurring the issue. Of course I know\nThat within a month the sleeving snows will come\nWith cold, selective emphases, with massings\nAnd arbitrary contrasts, rendering things\nDeceptively simple, thickening the twigs\nTo frosty veins, bestowing epaulets\nAnd decorations on every birch and aspen.\nAnd the eye, self-satisfied, will be misled,\nThinking the puzzle solved, supposing at last\nIt can look forth and comprehend the world.\nThat\u2019s when you have to really watch yourself.\nSo I hope that you won\u2019t think me plain ungrateful\nFor not selecting one of your fine books,\nAnd I take it very kindly that you came\nAnd sat here and let me rattle on this way.", "keywords": []}, "BIRDWATCHERS OF AMERICA": {"body": "It\u2019s all very well to dream of a dove that saves,\nPicasso\u2019s or the Pope\u2019s,\nThe one that annually coos in Our Lady\u2019s ear\nHalf the world\u2019s hopes,\nAnd the other one that shall cunningly engineer\nThe retirement of all businessmen to their graves,\nAnd when this is brought about\nMake us the loving brothers of every lout-\nBut in our part of the country a false dusk\nLingers for hours; it steams\nFrom the soaked hay, wades in the cloudy woods,\nEngendering other dreams.\nFormless and soft beyond the fence it broods\nOr rises as a faint and rotten musk\nOut of a broken stalk.\nThere are some things of which we seldom talk;\nFor instance, the woman next door, whom we hear at night,\nClaims that when she was small\nShe found a man stone dead near the cedar trees\nAfter the first snowfall.\nThe air was clear.

dying\nA lonely shore in the midnight lying.\nHe lay as if he had laid him to sleep\nAnd the stars above him their watch did keep;\nAnd the mournful wind with the dreamy sigh\nThe homeless wanderer of the sky\nWas the only attendant whose gentle breath\nSoothed him yet on the couch of death;\nAnd the dying waves of the heedless sea\nFell at his feet most listlessly.\n\nBut he lay in peace with his solemn eye\nLooking far through the mists of futurity.\nA smile gleamed over the death-dew that lay\nOn his withered cheek as life ebbed away.\nA darkness lay on his forehead vast;\nBut the light of expectancy o\u2019er it was cast--\nA light that shone from the coming day\nTravelling unseen to the East away.\nIn his cloudy robes that lay shadowing wide\nI stretched myself motionless by his side;\nAnd his eyes with their calm unimpassioned power\nSoothing my heart like an evening shower\nLed in a spectral far-billowing train\nThe hours of the Past through my spirit again.\n\nThere were fears of evil whose stony eyes\nFroze joy in its gushing melodies.\nSome floated afar on thy tranquil wave\nAnd the heart looked up from its search for a grave;\nWhile others as guests to the bosom came\nAnd left its wild children more sorrow less shame;\nFor the death-look parts from their chilling brow\nAnd they bless the heads that before them bow;\nAnd floating away in the far-off gloom.\nThankfulness follows them to their tomb.\nThere were Hopes that found not a place to rest\nTheir foot \u2018mid the rush of all-ocean\u2019s breast;\nAnd home to the sickening heart flew back\nBut changed into sorrows upon their track;\nAnd through the moan of the darkening sea\nBearing no leaf from the olive-tree.\nThere were joys that looked forth with their maiden eyes\nAnd smiled and were gone with a sad surprise;\nAnd the Love of the Earthly whose beauteous form\nBeckoned me on through sunshine and storm;\nBut when the bounding heart sprang high\nMeeting her smile with a speechless sigh\nThe arms sunk home with a painful start\nClasping a vacancy to the heart.\n\nAnd the voice of the dying I seem to hear\nBut whether his breathing is in mine ear\nOr the sounds of the breaking billows roll\nThe lingering accents upon my soul\nI know not; but thus they seem to bear\nReproof to my soul for its faint despair:--\nBlame not life it is scarce begun;\nBlame not mankind thyself art one.\nAnd change is holy oh! blame it never;\nThy soul shall live by its changing ever;\nNot the bubbling change of a stagnant pool\nBut the change of a river flowing and full;\nWhere all that is noble and good will grow\nMightier still as the full tides flow;\nTill it joins the hidden the boundless sea\nRolling through depths of Eternity.\nBlame not thy thought that it cannot reach\nThat which the Infinite must teach;\nBless thy God that the Word came nigh\nTo guide thee home to thy native sky\nWhere all things are homely and glorious too\nAnd the children are wondering and glad and true.\n\nAnd he pointed away to an Eastern star\nThat gleamed through his robes o\u2019er the ocean afar;\nAnd I knew that a star had looked o\u2019er the rim\nOf my world that lay all dreary and dim;\nAnd was slowly dissolving the darkness deep\nWhich like evil nurse had soothed me to sleep;\nAnd rising higher and shining clearer\nWould draw the day-spring ever nearer\nTill the sunshine of God burst full on the morn\nAnd every hill and valley would start\nWith the joy of light and new gratitude born\nTo Him who had led me home to His heart;\nAnd all things that lived in my world within\nWith the gladness of tears to His feet come in;\nAnd the false Self be banished with fiends to dwell\nIn the gloomiest haunts of his native hell;\nAnd Pride that ruled like a god above\nBe trod \u2018neath the feet of triumphant Love.\n\nAnd again he pointed across the sea\nAnd another vision arose in me:\nAnd I knew I walked an ocean of fear\nYet of safety too for the Master was near;\nAnd every wave of sorrow or dread\nO\u2019er which strong faith should upraise my head\nWould show from the height of its troubled crest\nStill nearer and nearer the Land of Rest.\nAnd when the storm-spray on the wind should arise\nAnd with tears unbidden should blind mine eyes\nAnd hide from my vision the Home of Love\nI knew I must look to the star above\nAnd the mists of Passion would quickly flee\nAnd the storm would faint to serenity.\n\nAnd again it seemed as if words found scope\nThe sorrowing words of a farewell Hope:\n\u201cI will meet thee again in that deathless

fire_\n_Where crystal broke and dazzled shudderingly._\n_I check my swift pursuit: for see where lie_\n_Bruised being twins in love by languor sweet_\n_Two sleeping girls clasped at my very feet._\n_I seize and run with them nor part the pair_\n_Breaking this covert of frail petals where_\n_Roses drink scent of the sun and our light play_\n_\u2019Mid tumbled flowers shall match the death of day._\nI love that virginal fury--ah the wild\nThrill when a maiden body shrinks defiled\nShuddering like arctic light from lips that sear\nIts nakedness ... the flesh in secret fear!\nContagiously through my linked pair it flies\nWhere innocence in either struggling dies\nWet with fond tears or some less piteous dew.\n_Gay in the conquest of these fears I grew_\n_So rash that I must needs the sheaf divide_\n_Of ruffled kisses heaven itself had tied._\n_For as I leaned to stifle in the hair_\n_Of one my passionate laughter (taking care_\n_With a stretched finger that her innocence_\n_Might stain with her companion\u2019s kindling sense_\n_To touch the younger little one who lay_\n_Child-like unblushing) my ungrateful prey_\n_Slips from me freed by passion\u2019s sudden death_\n_Nor heeds the frenzy of my sobbing breath._\n\nLet it pass! others of their hair shall twist\nA rope to drag me to those joys I missed.\nSee how the ripe pomegranates bursting red\nTo quench the thirst of the mumbling bees have bled;\nSo too our blood kindled by some chance fire\nFlows for the swarming legions of desire.\nAt evening when the woodland green turns gold\nAnd ashen grey \u2019mid the quenched leaves behold!\nRed Etna glows by Venus visited\nWalking the lava with her snowy tread\nWhene\u2019er the flames in thunderous slumber die.\nI hold the goddess!\n                    Ah sure penalty!\n\nBut the unthinking soul and body swoon\nAt last beneath the heavy hush of noon.\nForgetful let me lie where summer\u2019s drouth\nSifts fine the sand and then with gaping mouth\nDream

And yet it\u2019s this sleep\nAlways at hand, always available, always present,\nAlways underneath, in full reserve,\nThat of yesterday, and that of tomorrow, like good food for one\u2019s being,\nLike a strengthening of being, like a reservoir of being,\nThat\u2019s inexhaustible. Always there.\nThat of this morning and that of this evening\nThat strengthens his legs.\nThe sleep from before, the sleep from after\nIt\u2019s this same bottomless sleep\nAs continuous as being itself\nWhich passes from night to night, from one night to the next, which\ncontinues from one night to the next\nBy passing over the days\nLeaving the days as days, like so many holes.\nIt\u2019s in this same sleep that children bury their whole being\nWhich maintains, which creates for them every day new legs,\nTheir brand new legs.\nAnd also that which is in their new legs: new souls.\nTheir new souls, their fresh souls.\nFresh in the morning, fresh at noon, fresh in the evening.\nFresh like the roses of France.\nTheir souls with the undrooping collars. This is the secret to being\nindefatigable.\nJust sleep. Why don\u2019t people make use of it.\nI\u2019ve given this secret to everyone, says God, I haven\u2019t sold it.\nHe who sleeps well, lives well. He who sleeps, prays.\n(He who works, prays too. But there\u2019s time for everything. Both for\nsleep and for work.\nWork and sleep are like two brothers. And they get on very well\ntogether.\nAnd sleep leads to work just like work leads to sleep.\nHe who works well sleeps well, he who sleeps well works well.)\n\n\nII.\n\nThere must be, says God, some relationship,\nThere must be something going on\nBetween the kingdom of France and this little Hope.\nThere\u2019s some secret there. They work too well together. And yet they\ntell me\nThat, there are men who don\u2019t sleep.\nI don\u2019t like the man who doesn\u2019t sleep, says God.\nSleep is the friend of man.\nSleep is the friend of God.\nSleep may be my most beautiful creation.\nAnd I too rested on the seventh day.\nHe whose heart is pure, sleeps. And he who sleeps has a pure heart.\nThis is the great secret to being as indefatigable as a child.\nTo have that strength in your legs that a child has.\nThose new legs, those new souls\nAnd to start over every morning, always new,\nLike the young, like the new\nHope. Yes, they tell me that there are men\nWho work well and who sleep poorly.\nWho don\u2019t sleep. What a lack of confidence in me.\nIt\u2019s almost worse than if they worked poorly but slept well.\nThan if they worked but didn\u2019t sleep, because sloth\nIs no worse a sin than anxiety\nIn fact, it\u2019s even a less serious than anxiety\nAnd than despair and than a lack of confidence in me.\nI\u2019m not talking, says God, about those men\nWho don\u2019t work and who don\u2019t sleep.\nThose men are sinners, it goes without saying. They get what they had\ncoming to them. Great sinners. All they have to do is work.\nI\u2019m talking about those who work and who don\u2019t sleep.\nI pity them. I\u2019m talking about those who work, and who thus\nIn doing this are following my commandment, poor children.\nAnd who, on the other hand, don\u2019t have the courage, don\u2019t have the\nconfidence, don\u2019t sleep.\nI pity them. I hold it against them. A bit. They don\u2019t trust me.\nAs a child lays innocently in his mother\u2019s arms, thus do they not lay.\nInnocently in the arms of my Providence.\nThey have the courage to work. They don\u2019t have the courage to do\nnothing.\nThey possess the virtue of work. They don\u2019t possess the virtue of doing\nnothing.\nOf relaxing. Of resting. Of sleeping.\nUnhappy people, they don\u2019t know what\u2019s good.\nThey look after their affairs well during the day.\nBut they don\u2019t want to give them to me to look after during the night.\nAs if I weren\u2019t capable of looking after them for one night.\nHe who doesn\u2019t sleep is unfaithful to Hope.\nAnd that\u2019s the greatest infidelity.\nBecause it\u2019s an infidelity to the greatest Faith.\nPoor children, they manage their affairs wisely during the day.\nBut, come nightfall, they can\u2019t resolve\nThey can\u2019t resign themselves to entrust their affairs to my wisdom\nThey can\u2019t allow me to govern their affairs for the space of one night.\nTo take over the management and government of their affairs.\nAs if I weren\u2019t capable, I suppose, of looking after them a bit.\nOf watching over them.\nOf managing and governing and all the rest.\nI manage plenty of other affairs, poor people, I govern creation, surely\nthat\u2019s more difficult.\nMaybe you could, without much loss, leave your affairs in my hands,\nwise men.\nSurely I am as wise as you are.\nPerhaps you could hand them over to me for the space of a night.\nWhile you sleep\nAt least\nAnd maybe tomorrow morning you won\u2019t find them too badly\ndamaged.\nMaybe tomorrow morning they won\u2019t be any worse off.\nI\u2019m probably still capable of guiding them a bit.\nI\u2019m talking of those who work\nAnd who in this follow my commandment.\nAnd who don\u2019t sleep, and who in this\nReject all that\u2019s good in my creation,\nSleep, all that I have created good\nAnd who reject all the same my same commandment.\nWhat ingratitude these poor children have toward me\nTo reject such a good,\nSuch a beautiful commandment.\nThese poor children are following human wisdom.\nHuman wisdom says Never put off till tomorrow\nWhat you can do today.\nWhereas I tell you He who can put off till tomorrow\nIs he who is most pleasing to God.\nHe who sleeps like a child\nIs he, too, who sleeps like my precious Hope.\nAnd I tell you Put off till tomorrow\nThose concerns and those worries that are eating at you today\nAnd that might devour you today.\nPut off till tomorrow those sobs that choke you\nWhen you see today\u2019s misery.\nThose sobs that rise in you and strangle you.\nPut off till tomorrow those tears that fill your eyes and cover your face.\nThat flood you. That fall down your cheeks. Those tears flowing from\nyour eyes.\nBecause between today and tomorrow, I, God may have passed by.\nHuman wisdom says: Cursed is he who puts off till tomorrow.\nAnd I say Happy, happy is he who puts off till tomorrow.\nHappy is he who puts off. Which means Happy is he who hopes. And\nwho sleeps.\nAnd I say on the contrary Cursed.\nCursed is he who lies awake and doesn\u2019t trust me. What a mistrusting\nof me. Cursed is he who lies awake.\nAnd who drags.\nCursed is he who drags through the evenings and through the nights.\nThrough the eve of evening and through the fall of night.\nLike a snail\u2019s trail across these beautiful eves.\nMy creatures.\nLike a slug\u2019s trail across these beautiful nightfalls.\nMy creatures, my creation.\nThe thick remembrances of daily cares.\nThe burning, the gnawing.\nThe dirty tracks of our cares, the bitterness and the anxieties.\nThe sorrows.\nThe trails of slugs. Upon the flowers of my night.\nTruly I tell you that this offends\nMy precious Hope.\nWho wouldn\u2019t want to entrust me with the supervision of his night.\nAs if I hadn\u2019t proven myself.\nWho wouldn\u2019t want to entrust me with the supervision of one of his\nnights.\nAs if I were asking for more than one.\nWho, having surrendered his affairs in poor condition when he went to\nbed,\nHas not found them well when he woke up.\nBecause I may have paid him a visit.\n\n\nIII.\n\nAs the sea is the reservoir of water so night is the reservoir of being.\nIt\u2019s the time that I\u2019ve reserved for myself. No matter what these feverish\ndays may do.\nAs in the open sea, in the middle of the night, they bathe in the\nfullness of night.\nIt\u2019s they that are scattered, it\u2019s they that are fragmented.\nThe days are the Sporades Islands and night is the open sea\nUpon which St. Paul sailed\nAnd the border that descends from night to day\nIs always a rising border\nA steep border, and the border that rises from the day toward the night\nIs always a descending border. In the depths of night.\nO night, my finest invention, my most noble creation of all.\nMy most beautiful creature. Creature of the greatest Hope.\nYou give the most substance of Hope.\nYou are the instrument, you are the very substance and the\ndwelling-place of Hope.\nAnd also, (and thus), you are ultimately the creature of the greatest\nCharity.\nBecause it\u2019s you who gently rock the whole of Creation\nInto a restoring Sleep.\nAs one lays a child in his little bed,\nAs his mother lays him down and as his mother tucks him in\nAd kisses him (She\u2019s not afraid of waking him up.\nHe\u2019s sleeping so soundly.)\nAs his mother tucks him in and laughs and kisses his forehead\nFor pleasure.\nAnd he too laughs, he laughs in response while sleeping.\nSo too, o night, dark-eyed mother, universal mother,\nNot only mother of children (it\u2019s so easy)\nBut even mother of men and of women, which is so difficult,\nIt\u2019s you, night, who put to bed the whole of Creation\nIn a bed of a few hours\n(Awaiting.)

And all the days together\nWill never be day, they will never be anything but several days.\nScattered. The days will never be anything but flashes.\nUncertain flashes, and you, night, you are my great somber light.\nI congratulate myself for having made night. The days are isles and\nislands.\nThat pierce and split the sea.\nBut they have to rest in the deep sea.\nThey\u2019re forced to.\nAnd you too, days, you\u2019re forced to as well.\nYou have to rest in the deep night.\nAnd you, night, you are the deep sea\nUpon which St. Paul sailed, not that little lake in Galilee.\nAl the days are nothing but members\nDismembered members. It\u2019s the days that emerge, but even so they\nhave to be anchored in the deep water.\nIn the deep night. Night, my finest invention, it\u2019s you who calm, it\u2019s\nyou who soothe, it\u2019s you who bring rest\nTo aching limbs\nAll out of joint from the days work.\nIt\u2019s you who calm, it\u2019s you who soothe, it\u2019s you who bring rest\nTo aching hearts\nTo bruised bodies, to limbs bruised from work, to hearts bruised from\nwork\nAnd from daily cares and sorrow.\nO Night, o my daughter Night, the most religious of all my daughters\nThe most reverent.\nOf all my daughters, of all my creatures, the most abandoned into my\nhands.\nYou glorify me in the Sleep even more than your Brother, Day, glorifies me\nin Work.\nBecause in work man only glorifies me by his work.\nWhereas in sleep it is I who glorify myself by man\u2019s surrender.\nAnd it\u2019s more certain, and I know better how to go about it.\nNight, you are for man a more nourishing food than bread and wine.\nBecause the man who eats and drinks, if he doesn\u2019t sleep, will not\nprofit from his nourishment.\nAnd it will sour and upset his stomach.\nBut if he sleeps, the bread and wine will become his flesh and blood.\nFor working. For praying. For sleeping.\nNight, you alone dress wounds.\nAching hearts. All out of joint.

I behold\nIn Ombos, where the fallen Titans dwell,\nWith mountain-builded walls, and gulfs for moat,\nThe secret cleft that cunning dwarves have dug\nBeneath an alp-like buttress; and I list,\nToo late, the clam of adamantine gongs\nDinned by their drowsy guardians, whose feet\nHave fell the wasp-like sting of little knives\nEmbrued With slobber of the basilisk\nOr the pail Juice of wounded upas. In\nSome red Antarean garden-world, I see\nThe sacred flower with lips of purple flesh,\nAnd silver-Lashed, vermilion-lidded eyes\nOf torpid azure; whom his furtive priests\nAt moonless eve in terror seek to slay\nWith bubbling grails of sacrificial blood\nThat hide a hueless poison. And I read\nUpon the tongue of a forgotten sphinx,\nThe annulling word a spiteful demon wrote\nIn gall of slain chimeras; and I know\nWhat pentacles the lunar wizards use,\nThat once allured the gulf-returning roc,\nWith ten great wings of furl\u00e8d storm, to pause\nMidmost an alabaster mount; and there,\nWith boulder-weighted webs of dragons\u2019 gut\nUplift by cranes a captive giant built,\nThey wound the monstrous, moonquake-throbbing bird,\nAnd plucked from off his saber-taloned feet\nUranian sapphires fast in frozen blood,\nAnd amethysts from Mars. I lean to read\nWith slant-lipped mages, in an evil star,\nThe monstrous archives of a war that ran\nThrough wasted eons, and the prophecy\nOf wars renewed, which shall commemorate\nSome enmity of wivern-headed kings\nEven to the brink of time. I know the blooms\nOf bluish fungus, freaked with mercury,\nThat bloat within the creators of the moon,\nAnd in one still, selenic and fetor; and I know\nWhat clammy blossoms, blanched and cavern-grown,\nAre proffered to their gods in Uranus\nBy mole-eyed peoples; and the livid seed\nOf some black fruit a king in Saturn ate,\nWhich, cast upon his tinkling palace-floor,\nTook root between the burnished flags, and now\nHath mounted and become a hellish tree,\nWhose lithe and hairy branches, lined with mouths,\nNet like a hundred ropes his lurching throne,\nAnd strain at starting pillars. I behold\nThe slowly-thronging corals that usurp\nSome harbour of a million-masted sea,\nAnd sun them on the league-long wharves of gold--\nBulks of enormous crimson, kraken-limbed\nAnd kraken-headed, lifting up as crowns\nThe octiremes of perished emperors,\nAnd galleys fraught with royal gems, that sailed\nFrom a sea-fled haven.\n\nSwifter and stranger grow\nThe visions: now a mighty city looms,\nHewn from a hill of purest cinnabar\nTo domes and turrets like a sunrise thronged\nWith tier on tier of captive moons, half-drowned\nIn shifting erubescence. But whose hands\nWere sculptors of its doors, and columns wrought\nTo semblance of prodigious blooms of old,\nNo eremite hath lingered there to say,\nAnd no man comes to learn: for long ago\nA prophet came, warning its timid king\nAgainst the plague of lichens that had crept\nAcross subverted empires, and the sand\nOf wastes that cyclopean mountains ward;\nWhich, slow and ineluctable, would come\nTo take his fiery bastions and his fanes,\nAnd quench his domes with greenish tetter. Now\nI see a host of naked gents, armed\nWith horns of behemoth and unicorn,\nWho wander, blinded by the clinging spells\nO hostile wizardry, and stagger on\nTo forests where the very leaves have eyes,\nAnd ebonies like wrathful dragons roar\nTo teaks a-chuckle in the loathly gloom;\nWhere coiled lianas lean, with serried fangs,\nFrom writhing palms with swollen boles that moan;\nWhere leeches of a scarlet moss have sucked\nThe eyes of some dead monster, and have crawled\nTo bask upon his azure-spotted spine;\nWhere hydra-throated blossoms hiss and sing,\nOr yawn with mouths that drip a sluggish dew\nWhose touch is death and slow corrosion. Then\nI watch a war of pygmies, met by night,\nWith pitter of their drums of parrot\u2019s hide,\nOn plains with no horizon, where a god\nMight lose his way for centuries; and there,\nIn wreath\u00e8d light and fulgors all convolved,\nA rout of green, enormous moons ascend,\nWith rays that like a shivering venom run\nOn inch-long swords of lizard-fang.\n\nSurveyed\nFrom this my throne, as from a central sun,\nThe pageantries of worlds and cycles pass;\nForgotten splendors, dream by dream, unfold\nLike tapestry, and vanish; violet suns,\nOr suns of changeful iridescence, bring\nTheir rays about me like the colored lights\nImploring priests might lift to glorify\nThe face of some averted god; the songs\nOf mystic poets in a purple world\nAscend to me in music that is made\nFrom unconceiv\u00e8d perfumes and the pulse\nOf love ineffable; the lute-players\nWhose lutes are strung with gold of the utmost moon,\nCall forth delicious languors, never known\nSave to their golden kings; the sorcerers\nOf hooded stars inscrutable to God,\nSurrender me their demon-wrested scrolls,\nlnscribed with lore of monstrous alchemies\nAnd awful transformations.\n\nIf I will\nI am at once the vision and the seer,\nAnd mingle with my ever-streaming pomps,\nAnd still abide their suzerain: I am\nThe neophyte who serves a nameless god,\nWithin whose fane the fanes of Hecatompylos\nWere arks the Titan worshippers might bear,\nOr flags to pave the threshold; or I am\nThe god himself, who calls the fleeing clouds\nInto the nave where suns might congregate\nAnd veils the darkling mountain of his face\nWith fold on solemn fold; for whom the priests\nAmass their monthly hecatomb of gems\nOpals that are a camel-cumbering load,\nAnd monstrous alabraundines, won from war\nWith realms of hostile serpents; which arise,\nCombustible, in vapors many-hued\nAnd myrrh-excelling perfumes. It is I,\nThe king, who holds with scepter-dropping hand\nThe helm of some great barge of orichalchum,\nSailing upon an amethystine sea\nTo isles of timeless summer: for the snows\nOf Hyperborean winter, and their winds,\nSleep in his jewel-builded capital,\nNor any charm of flame-wrought wizardry,\nNor conjured suns may rout them; so he fees,\nWith captive kings to urge his serried oars,\nHopeful of dales where amaranthine dawn\nHath never left the faintly sighing lote\nAnd lisping moly. Firm of heart, I fare\nImpanoplied with azure diamond,\nAs hero of a quest Achernar lights,\nTo deserts filled with ever-wandering flames\nThat feed upon the sullen marl, and soar\nTo wrap the slopes of mountains, and to leap\nWith tongues intolerably lengthening\nThat lick the blench\u00e8d heavens. But there lives\n(Secure as in a garden walled from wind)\nA lonely flower by a placid well,\nMidmost the flaring tumult of the flames,\nThat roar as roars a storm-possessed sea,\nImpacable for ever; and within\nThat simple grail the blossom lifts, there lies\nOne drop of an incomparable dew\nWhich heals the parch\u00e8d weariness of kings,\nAnd cures the wound of wisdom. I am page\nTo an emperor who reigns ten thousand years,\nAnd through his labyrinthine palace-rooms,\nThrough courts and colonnades and balconies\nWherein immensity itself is mazed,\nI seek the golden gorget he hath lost,\nOn which, in sapphires fine as orris-seed,\nAre writ the names of his conniving stars\nAnd friendly planets. Roaming thus, I hear\nLike demon tears incessant, through dark ages,\nThe drip of sullen clepsydrae; and once\nIn every lustrum, hear the brazen clocks\nInnumerably clang with such a sound\nAs brazen hammers make, by devils dinned\nOn tombs of all the dead; and nevermore\nI find the gorget, but at length I find\nA seal\u00e8d room whose nameless prisoner\nMoans with a nameless torture, and would turn\nTo hell\u2019s red rack as to a lilied couch\nFrom that whereon they stretched him; and I find,\nProstrate upon a lotus-painted floor,\nThe loveliest of all beloved slaves\nMy emperor hath, and from her pulseless side\nA serpent rises, whiter than the root\nOf some venefic bloom in darkness grown,\nAnd gazes up with green-lit eyes that seem\nLike drops of cold, congealing poison.\n\nHark!\nWhat word was whispered in a tongue unknown,\nIn crypts of some impenetrable world?\nWhose is the dark, dethroning secrecy\nI cannot share, though I am king of suns,\nAnd king therewith of strong eternity,\nWhose gnomons with their swords of shadow guard\nMy gates, and slay the intruder? Silence loads\nThe wind of ether, and the worlds are still\nTo hear the word that flees mine audience.\nIn simultaneous ruin, al my dreams\nFall like a rack of fuming vapors raised\nTo semblance by a necromant, and leave\nSpirit and sense unthinkably alone\nAbove a universe of shrouded stars\nAnd suns that wander, cowled with sullen gloom,\nLike witches to a Sabbath. . . . Fear is born\nIn crypts below the nadir, and hath crawled\nReaching the floor of space, and waits for wings\nTo lift it upward like a hellish worm\nFain for the flesh of cherubim. Red orbs\nAnd eyes that gleam remotely as the stars,\nBut are not eyes of suns or galaxies,\nGather and throng to the base of darkness; flame\nBehind some black, abysmal curtain burns,\nImplacable, and fanned to whitest wrath\nBy rais\u00e8d wings that flail the whiffled gloom,\nAnd make a brief and broken wind that moans\nAs one who rides a throbbing rack. There is\nA Thing that crouches, worlds and years remote,\nWhose horns a demon sharpens, rasping forth\nA note to shatter the donjon-keeps of time,\nOr crack the sphere of crystal. All is dark\nFor ages, and my toiling heart-suspends\nIts clamor as within the clutch of death\nTightening with tense, hermetic rigors. Then,\nIn one enormous, million-flashing flame,\nThe stars unveil, the suns remove their cowls,\nAnd beam to their responding planets; time\nIs mine once more, and armies of its dreams\nRally to that insuperable throne\nFirmed on the zenith.\n\nOnce again I seek\nThe meads of shining moly I had found\nIn some anterior vision, by a stream\nNo cloud hath ever tarnished; where the sun,\nA gold Narcissus, loiters evermore\nAbove his golden image. But I find\nA corpse the ebbing water will not keep,\nWith eyes like sapphires that have lain in hell|\nAnd felt the hissing coals; and all the flowers\nAbout me turn to hooded serpents, swayed\nBy flutes of devils in lascivious dance\nMeet for the nod of Satan, when he reigns\nAbove the raging Sabbath, and is wooed\nBy sarabands of witches. But I turn\nTo mountains guarding with their horns of snow\nThe source of that befoul\u00e8d rill, and seek\nA pinnacle where none but eagles climb,\nAnd they with failing pennons. But in vain\nI flee, for on that pylon of the sky\nSome curse hath turned the unprinted snow to flame--\nRed fires that curl and cluster to my tread,\nTrying the summit\u2019s narrow cirque. And now\nI see a silver python far beneath--\nVast as a river that a fiend hath witched\nAnd forced to flow reverted in its course\nTo mountains whence it issued. Rapidly\nIt winds from slope to crumbling slope, and fills\nRavines and chasmal gorges, till the crags\nTotter with coil on coil incumbent. Soon\nIt hath entwined the pinnacle I keep,\nAnd gapes with a fanged, unfathomable maw\nWherein Great Typhon and Enceladus\nWere orts of daily glut. But I am gone,\nFor at my call a hippogriff hath come,\nAnd firm between his thunder-beating wings\nI mount the sheer cerulean walls of noon\nAnd see the earth, a spurn\u00e8d pebble, fall--\nLost in the fields of nether stars--and seek\nA planet where the outwearied wings of time\nMight pause and furl for respite, or the plumes\nOf death be stayed, and loiter in reprieve\nAbove some deathless lily: for therein\nBeauty hath found an avatar of flowers--\nBlossoms that clothe it as a colored flame\nFrom peak to peak, from pole to sullen pole,\nAnd turn the skies to perfume. There I find\nA lonely castle, calm, and unbeset\nSave by the purple spears of amaranth,\nAnd leafing iris tender-sworded. Walls\nOf flush\u00e8d marble, wonderful with rose,\nAnd domes like golden bubbles, and minarets\nThat take the clouds as coronal-these are mine,\nFor voiceless looms the peaceful barbican,\nAnd the heavy-teethed portcullis hangs aloft\nTo grin a welcome. So I leave awhile\nMy hippogriff to crop the magic meads,\nAnd pass into a court the lilies hold,\nAnd tread them to a fragrance that pursues\nTo win the portico, whose columns, carved\nOf lazuli and amber, mock the palms\nOf bright Aidennic forests-capitalled\nWith fronds of stone fretted to airy lace,\nEnfolding drupes that seem as tawny clusters\nOf breasts of unknown houris; and convolved\nWith vines of shut and shadowy-leav\u00e8d flowers\nLike the dropt lids of women that endure\nSome loin-dissolving ecstasy. Through doors\nEnlaid with lilies twined luxuriously,\nI enter, dazed and blinded with the sun,\nAnd hear, in gloom that changing colors cloud,\nA chuckle sharp as crepitating ice\nUpheaved and cloven by shoulders of the damned\nWho strive in Antenora. When my eyes\nUndazzle, and the cloud of color fades,\nI find me in a monster-guarded room,\nWhere marble apes with wings of griffins crowd\nOn walls an evil sculptor wrought, and beasts\nWherein the sloth and vampire-bat unite,\nPendulous by their toes of tarnished bronze,\nUsurp the shadowy interval of lamps\nThat hang from ebon arches. Like a ripple\nBorne by the wind from pool to sluggish pool\nIn fields where wide Cocytus flows his bound,\nA crackling smile around that circle runs,\nAnd all the stone-wrought gibbons stare at me\nWith eyes that turn to glowing coals. A fear\nThat found no name in Babel, flings me on,\nBreathless and faint with horror, to a hall\nWithin whose weary, self-reverting round,\nThe languid curtains, heavier than palls,\nUnnumerably depict a weary king\nWho fain would cool his jewel-crusted hands\nIn lakes of emerald evening, or the field\nOf dreamless poppies pure with rain. I flee\nOnward, and all the shadowy curtains shake\nWith tremors of a silken-sighing mirth,\nAnd whispers of the innumerable king,\nBreathing a tale of ancient pestilence\nWhose very words are vile contagion. Then\nI reach a room where caryatids,\nCarved in the form of voluptuous Titan women,\nSurround a throne flowering ebony\nWhere creeps a vine of crystal. On the throne\nThere lolls a wan, enormous Worm, whose bulk,\nTumid with all the rottenness of kings,\nOverflows its arms with fold on creas\u00e8d fold\nObscenely bloating. Open-mouthed he leans,\nAnd from his fulvous throat a score of tongues,\nDepending like to wreaths of torpid vipers,\nDrivel with phosphorescent slime, that runs\nDown all his length of soft and monstrous folds,\nAnd creeping among the flowers of ebony,\nLends them the life of tiny serpents. Now,\nEre the Horror ope those red and lashless slits\nOf eyes that draw the gnat and midge, I turn\nAnd follow down a dusty hall, whose gloom,\nLined by the statues with their mighty limbs,\nEnds in golden-roof\u00e8d balcony\nSphering the flowered horizon.\n\nEre my heart\nHath hushed the panic tumult of its pulses,\nI listen, from beyond the horizon\u2019s rim,\nA mutter faint as when the far simoom,\nMounting from unknown deserts, opens forth,\nWide as the waste, those wings of torrid night\nThat shake the doom of cities from their folds,\nAnd musters in its van a thousand winds\nThat, with disrooted palms for besoms, rise,\nAnd sweep the sands to fury. As the storm,\nApproaching, mounts and loudens to the ears\nOf them that toil in fields of sesame,\nSo grows the mutter, and a shadow creeps\nAbove the gold horizon like a dawn\nOf darkness climbing zenith-ward. They come,\nThe Sabaoth of retribution, drawn\nFrom all dread spheres that knew my trespassing,\nAnd led by vengeful fiends and dire alastors\nThat owned my sway aforetime! Cockatrice,\nChimera, martichoras, behemoth,\nGeryon, and sphinx, and hydra, on my ken\nArise as might some Afrit-builded city\nConsummate in the lifting of a lash\nWith thunderous domes and sounding obelisks\nAnd towers of night and fire alternate! Wings\nOf white-hot stone along the hissing wind\nBear up the huge and furnace-hearted beasts\nOf hells beyond Rutilicus; and things\nWhose lightless length would mete the gyre of moons--\nBorn from the caverns of a dying sun\nUncoil to the very zenith, half-disclosed\nFrom gulfs below the horizon; octopi\nLike blazing moons with countless arms of fire,\nClimb from the seas of ever-surging flame\nThat roll and roar through planets unconsumed,\nBeating on coasts of unknown metals; beasts\nThat range the mighty worlds of Alioth rise,\nAfforesting the heavens with mulitudinous horns\nAmid whose maze the winds are lost; and borne\nOn cliff-like brows of plunging scolopendras,\nThe shell-wrought towers of ocean-witches loom;\nAnd griffin-mounted gods, and demons throned\nOn-sable dragons, and the cockodrills\nThat bear the spleenful pygmies on their backs;\nAnd blue-faced wizards from the worlds of Saiph,\nOn whom Titanic scorpions fawn; and armies\nThat move with fronts reverted from the foe,\nAnd strike athwart their shoulders at the shapes\nThe shields reflect in crystal; and eidola\nFashioned within unfathomable caves\nBy hands of eyeless peoples; and the blind\nWorm-shapen monsters of a sunless world,\nWith krakens from the ultimate abyss,\nAnd Demogorgons of the outer dark,\nArising, shout with dire multisonous clamors,\nAnd threatening me with dooms ineffable\nIn words whereat the heavens leap to flame,\nAdvance upon the enchanted palace. Falling\nFor league on league before, their shadows light\nAnd eat like fire the arnaranthine meads,\nLeaving an ashen desert. In the palace\nI hear the apes of marble shriek and howl,\nAnd all the women-shapen columns moan,\nBabbling with terror. In my tenfold fear,\nA monstrous dread unnamed in any hall,\nI rise, and flee with the fleeing wind for wings,\nAnd in a trice the wizard palace reefs,\nAnd spring to a single tower of flame,\nGoes out, and leaves nor shard nor ember! Flown\nBeyond the world upon that fleeing wind\nI reach the gulf\u2019s irrespirable verge,\nWhere fads the strongest storm for breath, and fall,\nSupportless, through the nadir-plung\u00e8d gloom,\nBeyond the scope and vision of the sun,\nTo other skies and systems.\n\nIn a world\nDeep-wooded with the multi-colored fungi\nThat soar to semblance of fantastic palms,\nI fall as falls the meteor-stone, and break\nA score of trunks to atom powder. Unharmed\nI rise, and through the illimitable woods,\nAmong the trees of flimsy opal, roam,\nAnd see their tops that clamber hour by hour\nTo touch the suns of iris. Things unseen,\nWhose charnel breath informs the tideless air\nWith spreading pools of fetor, follow me,\nElusive past the ever-changing palms;\nAnd pittering moths with wide and ashen wings\nFlit on before, and insects ember-hued,\nDescending, hurtle through the gorgeous gloom\nAnd quench themselves in crumbling thickets. Heard\nFar off, the gong-like roar of beasts unknown\nResounds at measured intervals of time,\nShaking the riper trees to dust, that falls\nIn clouds of acrid perfume, stifling me\nBeneath an irised pall.\n\nNow the palmettoes\nGrow far apart, and lessen momently\nTo shrubs a dwarf might topple. Over them\nI see an empty desert, all ablaze\nWith ametrysts and rubies, and the dust\nOf garnets or carnelians. On I roam,\nTreading the gorgeous grit, that dazzles me\nWith leaping waves of endless rutilance,\nWhereby the air is turned to a crimson gloom\nThrough which I wander blind as any Kobold;\nTill underfoot the grinding sands give place\nTo stone or metal, with a massive ring\nMore welcome to mine ears than golden bells\nOr tinkle of silver fountains. When the gloom\nOf crimson lifts, I stand upon the edge\nOf a broad black plain of adamant that reaches,\nLevel as windless water, to the verge\nOf all the world; and through the sable plain\nA hundred streams of shattered marble run,\nAnd streams of broken steel, and streams of bronze,\nLike to the ruin of all the wars of time,\nTo plunge with clangor of timeless cataracts\nAdown the gulfs eternal.\n\nSo I follow\nBetween a river of steel and a river of bronze,\nWith ripples loud and tuneless as the clash\nOf a million lutes; and come to the precipice\nFrom which they fall, and make the mighty sound\nOf a million swords that meet a million shields,\nOr din of spears and armour in the wars\nOf half the worlds and eons. Far beneath\nThey fall, through gulfs and cycles of the void,\nAnd vanish like a stream of broken stars\ninto the nether darkness; nor the gods\nOf any sun, nor demons of the gulf,\nWill dare to know what everlasting sea\nIs fed thereby, and mounts forevermore\nIn one unebbing tide.\n\nWhat nimbus-cloud\nOr night of sudden and supreme eclipse,\nIs on the suns opal? At my side\nThe rivers run with a wan and ghostly gleam\nThrough darkness falling as the night that falls\nFrom spheres extinguished. Turning, I behold\nBetwixt the sable desert and the suns,\nThe pois\u00e8d wings of all the dragon-rout,\nFar-flown in black occlusion thousand-fold\nThrough stars, and deeps, and devastated worlds,\nUpon my trail of terror! Griffins, rocs,\nAnd sluggish, dark chimeras, heavy-winged\nAfter the ravin of dispeopled lands,\nAnd harpies, and the vulture-birds of hell,\nHot from abominable feasts, and fain\nTo cool their beaks and talons in my blood--\nAll, all have gathered, and the wingless rear,\nWith rank on rank of foul, colossal Worms,\nMakes horrent now the horizon. From the wan\nI hear the shriek of wyvers, loud and shrill\nAs tempests in a broken fane, and roar\nOf sphinxes, like relentless toll of bells\nFrom towers infernal. Cloud on hellish cloud\nThey arch the zenith, and a dreadful wind\nFalls from them like the wind before the storm,\nAnd in the wind my riven garment streams\nAnd flutters in the face of all the void,\nEven as flows a flaffing spirit, lost\nOn the pit s undying tempest. Louder grows\nThe thunder of the streams of stone and bronze--\nRedoubled with the roar of torrent wings\nInseparable mingled. Scarce I keep\nMy footing in the gulfward winds of fear,\nAnd mighty thunders beating to the void\nIn sea-like waves incessant; and would flee\nWith them, and prove the nadir-founded night\nWhere fall the streams of ruin. But when I reach\nThe verge, and seek through sun-defeating gloom\nTo measure with my gaze the dread descent,\nI see a tiny star within the depths--\nA light that stays me while the wings of doom\nConvene their thickening thousands: for the star\nincreases, taking to its hueless orb,\nWith all the speed of horror-chang\u00e8d dreams,\nThe light as of a million million moons;\nAnd floating up through gulfs and glooms eclipsed\nIt grows and grows, a huge white eyeless Face\nThat fills the void and fills the universe,\nAnd bloats against the limits of the world\nWith lips of flame that open . . .", "keywords": []}, "REMEMBERED LIGHT": {"body": "The years are a falling of snow,\nSlow, but without cessation,\nOn hills and mountains and flowers and worlds that were;\nBut snow and the crawling night in which it fell\nMay be washed away in one swifter hour of flame.\nThus it was that some slant of sunset\nIn the chasms of piled cloud--\nTransient mountains that made a new horizon,\nUplifting the west to fantastic pinnacles--\nSmote warm in a buried realm of the spirit,\nTill the snows of forgetfulness were gone.\n\nClear in the vistas of memory,\nThe peaks of a world long unremembered,\nSoared further than clouds, but fell not,\nBased on hills that shook not nor melted\nWith that burden enormous, hardly to be believed.\nRent with stupendous chasms,\nFull of an umber twilight,\nI beheld that larger world.\n\nBright was the twilight, sharp like ethereal wine\nAbove, but low in the clefts it thickened,\nDull as with duskier tincture.", "keywords": ["winter"]}}, "metadata": {"tag": "smith", "name": "Clark Ashton Smith", "birth": "1893", "death": "1961", "nationality": "american", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Ashton_Smith"}}, "snodgrass": {"poems": {"A LOCKED HOUSE": {"body": "As we drove back, crossing the hill, \nThe house still \nHidden in the trees, I always thought--\nA fool\u2019s fear\u2014that it might have caught \nFire, someone could have broken in. \nAs if things must have been \nToo good here.

What company, \nIn masks, can choir it with the naked wind? \n\n\n\tV. \n\nThe mother invites humanity to her house \nAnd table. The father fetches tellers of tales \nAnd musicians who mute much, muse much, on the tales. \n\nThe father fetches negresses to dance, \nAmong the children, like curious ripenesses \nOf pattern in the dance\u2019s ripening. \n\nFor these the musicians make insidious tones, \nClawing the sing-song of their instruments. \nThe children laugh and jangle a tinny time. \n\nThe father fetches pageants out of air, \nScenes of the theatre, vistas and blocks of woods \nAnd curtains like a naive pretence of sleep. \n\nAmong these the musicians strike the instinctive poem. \nThe father fetches his unherded herds, \nOf barbarous tongue, slavered and panting halves \n\nOf breath, obedient to his trumpet\u2019s touch. \nThis then is Chatillon or as you please. \nWe stand in the tumult of a festival. \n\nWhat festival? This loud, disordered mooch? \nThese hospitaliers? These brute-like guests? \nThese musicians dubbing at a tragedy, \n\nA-dub, a-dub, which is made up of this: \nThat there are no lines to speak? There is no play. \nOr, the persons act one merely by being here. \n\n\n\tVI.\n\nIt is a theatre floating through the clouds, \nItself a cloud, although of misted rock \nAnd mountains running like water, wave on wave, \n\nThrough waves of light. It is of cloud transformed \nTo cloud transformed again, idly, the way \nA season changes color to no end, \n\nExcept the lavishing of itself in change, \nAs light changes yellow into gold and gold \nTo its opal elements and fire\u2019s delight, \n\nSplashed wide-wise because it likes magnificence \nAnd the solemn pleasures of magnificent space \nThe cloud drifts idly through half-thought-of forms. \n\nThe theatre is filled with flying birds, \nWild wedges, as of a volcano\u2019s smoke, palm-eyed \nAnd vanishing, a web in a corridor \n\nOr massive portico. A capitol, \nIt may be, is emerging or has just \nCollapsed. The denouement has to be postponed . . . \n\nThis is nothing until in a single man contained, \nNothing until this named thing nameless is \nAnd is destroyed. He opens the door of his house \n\nOn flames. The scholar of one candle sees \nAn Arctic effulgence flaring on the frame \nOf everything he is. And he feels afraid.\n\n\n\tVII.\n\nIs there an imagination that sits enthroned \nAs grim as it is benevolent, the just \nAnd the unjust, which in the midst of summer stops \n\nTo imagine winter? When the leaves are dead, \nDoes it take its place in the north and enfold itself, \nGoat-leaper, crystalled and luminous, sitting \n\nIn highest night? And do these heavens adorn \nAnd proclaim it, the white creator of black, jetted \nBy extinguishings, even of planets as may be, \n\nEven of earth, even of sight, in snow, \nExcept as needed by way of majesty, \nIn the sky, as crown and diamond cabala?\n\nIt leaps through us, through all our heavens leaps, \nExtinguishing our planets, one by one, \nLeaving, of where we were and looked, of where \n\nWe knew each other and of each other thought, \nA shivering residue, chilled and foregone, \nExcept for that crown and mystical cabala. \n\nBut it dare not leap by chance in its own dark. \nIt must change from destiny to slight caprice. \nAnd thus its jetted tragedy, its stele \n\nAnd shape and mournful making move to find \nWhat must unmake it and, at last, what can, \nSay, a flippant communication under the moon. \n\n\n\tVIII.\n\nThere may be always a time of innocence. \nThere is never a place. Or if there is no time, \nIf it is not a thing of time, nor of place, \n\nExisting in the idea of it, alone, \nIn the sense against calamity, it is not \nLess real. For the oldest and coldest philosopher, \n\nThere is or may be a time of innocence \nAs pure principle. Its nature is its end, \nThat it should be, and yet not be, a thing \n\nThat pinches the pity of the pitiful man, \nLike a book at evening beautiful but untrue, \nLike a book on rising beautiful and true. \n\n\nIt is like a thing of ether that exists \nAlmost as predicate. But it exists, \nIt exists, it is visible, it is, it is. \n\nSo, then, these lights are not a spell of light, \nA saying out of a cloud, but innocence. \nAn innocence of the earth and no false sign \n\nOr symbol of malice. That we partake thereof, \nLie down like children in this holiness, \nAs if, awake, we lay in the quiet of sleep, \n\nAs if the innocent mother sang in the dark \nOf the room and on an accordion, half-heard, \nCreated the time and place in which we breathed . . . \n\n\n\tIX.\n\nAnd of each other thought\u2014in the idiom \nOf the work, in the idiom of an innocent earth, \nNot of the enigma of the guilty dream. \n\nWe were as Danes in Denmark all day long \nAnd knew each other well, hale-hearted landsmen, \nFor whom the outlandish was another day \n\nOf the week, queerer than Sunday.

Two hours before I had seen \nthis very rose on her bosom. \n\nI carefully picked up the flower that had fallen in the mud, and, going \nback to the drawing-room, laid it on the table before her chair. \n\nAnd now at last she came back, and with light footsteps, crossing the whole \nroom, sat down at the table. \n\nHer face was both paler and more vivid; her downcast eyes, that looked \nsomehow smaller, strayed rapidly in happy confusion from side to side. \n\nShe saw the rose, snatched it up, glanced at its crushed, muddy petals, \nglanced at me, and her eyes, brought suddenly to a standstill, were bright \nwith tears. \n\n\u2018What are you crying for?\u2019 I asked. \n\n\u2018Why, see this rose.

Only how can it grow and rise upwards? \nTo this precipice?\u2019 \n\nAnd yet, it grows, grows enormously . . . Already there are not separate \nhillocks heaving in the distance . . . One continuous, monstrous wave \nembraces the whole circle of the horizon. \n\nIt is swooping, swooping, down upon us! In an icy hurricane it flies, \nswirling in the darkness of hell. Everything shuddered-and there, in \nthis flying mass-was the crash of thunder, the iron wail of thousands of \nthroats . . .\n\nAh! what a roaring and moaning! It was the earth howling for terror . . .\n\nThe end of it! the end of all! \n\nThe child whimpered once more . . .

And drove tumult and war away\n  From girl and boy and man and beast;\n  The fields grew fatter day by day\n  The wild fowl of the air increased;\n  And every ancient Ollave said\n  While he bent down his fading head\n  \u201cHe drives away the Northern cold.\u201d\n  _They will not hush the leaves a-flutter round me\n    the beech leaves old._\n\n  I sat and mused and drank sweet wine;\n  A herdsman came from inland valleys\n  Crying the pirates drove his swine\n  To fill their dark-beaked hollow galleys.\n  I called my battle-breaking men\n  And my loud brazen battle-cars\n  From rolling vale and rivery glen\n  And under the blinking of the stars\n  Fell on the pirates by the deep\n  And hurled them in the gulph of sleep:\n  These hands won many a torque of gold.\n  _They will not hush the leaves a-flutter round me\n    the beech leaves old._\n\n  But slowly as I shouting slew\n  And trampled in the bubbling mire\n  In my most secret spirit grew\n  A whirling and a wandering fire:\n  I stood: keen stars above me shone\n  Around me shone keen eyes of men:\n  I laughed aloud and hurried on\n  By rocky shore and rushy fen;\n  I laughed because birds fluttered by\n  And starlight gleamed and clouds flew high\n  And rushes waved and waters rolled.\n  _They will not hush the leaves a-flutter round me\n    the beech leaves old._\n\n  And now I wander in the woods\n  When summer gluts the golden bees\n  Or in autumnal solitudes\n  Arise the leopard-coloured trees;\n  Or when along the wintry strands\n  The cormorants shiver on their rocks;\n  I wander on and wave my hands\n  And sing and shake my heavy locks.\n  The gray wolf knows me; by one ear\n  I lead along the woodland deer;\n  The hares run by me growing bold.\n  _They will not hush the leaves a-flutter round me\n    the beech leaves old._\n\n  I came upon a little town\n  That slumbered in the harvest moon\n  And passed a-tiptoe up and down\n  Murmuring to a fitful tune\n  How I have followed night and day\n  A tramping of tremendous feet\n  And saw where this old tympan lay\n  Deserted on a doorway seat\n  And bore it to the woods with me;\n  Of some unhuman misery\n  Our married voiced wildly trolled.\n  _They will not hush the leaves a-flutter round me\n    the beech leaves old._\n\n  I sang how when day\u2019s toil is done\n  Orchil shakes out her long dark hair\n  That hides away the dying sun\n  And sheds faint odours through the air:\n  When my hand passed from wire to wire\n  It quenched with sound like falling dew\n  The whirling and the wandering fire;\n  But lift a mournful ulalu\n  For the kind wires are torn and still\n  And I must wander wood and hill\n  Through summer\u2019s heat and winter\u2019s cold.\n  _They will not hush the leaves a-flutter round me\n    the
