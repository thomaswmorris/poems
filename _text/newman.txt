~OPUSCULUM~

Fair Cousin, thy page
is small to encage
the thoughts which engage
the mind of a sage,
such as I am;

'Twere in teaspoon to take
the whole Genevese lake,
or a lap-dog to make
the white Elephant sac-
-red in Siam.

Yet inadequate though
to the terms strange and so-
-lemn that figure in po-
-lysyllabical row
in a treatise; 

Still, true words and plain,
of the heart, not the brain,
in affectionate strain,
this book to contain
very meet is.

So I promise to be
a good Cousin to thee,
and to keep safe the se-
-cret I heard, although e-
-v'ry one know it;

With a lyrical air
my kind thoughts I would dare,
and offer whate'er
beseems the news, were
I a poet.


~LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT~

 Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,
      Lead thou me on!
  The night is dark, and I am far from home,--
      Lead thou me on!
  Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see
  The distant scene,--one step enough for me.

  I was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou
      Shouldst lead me on:
  I loved to choose and see my path, but now
      Lead thou me on!
  I loved the garish days, and, spite of fears,
  Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.

  So long thy power hath blessed me, sure it still
    Will lead me on;
  O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till
    The night is gone;
  And with the morn those angel faces smile
  Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.


~ENGLAND~

Type of the West, and glorying in the name
More than in Faith's pure fame!
Oh. trust not crafty fort nor rock renowned
Earned upon hostile ground;
Wielding Trade's master-keys, at thy proud will
To lock or loose its waters, England! trust not still.

Dread thine own power! Since haughty Babel's prime,
High towers have been man's crime.
Since her hoar age, when the huge moat lay bare,
Strongholds have been man's snare.
Thy nest is in the crags; ah, refuge frail!
Mad counsel in its hour, or traitors, will prevail.

He who scanned Sodom for His righteous men
Still spares thee for thy ten;
But, should vain tongues the Bride of Heaven defy,
He will not pass thee by;
For, as earth's kings welcome their spotless guest,
So gives He them by turn, to suffer or be blest.


~THE ELEMENTS~

MAN is permitted much 
To scan and learn 
In Nature’s frame; 
Till he well-nigh can tame 
Brute mischiefs, and can touch 
Invisible things, and turn 
All warring ills to purposes of good. 
Thus, as a god below, 
He can control, 
And harmonize, what seems amiss to flow 
As sever’d from the whole 
And dimly understood. 

But o’er the elements 
One Hand alone, 
One Hand has sway.
What influence day by day 
In straiter belt prevents 
The impious Ocean, thrown 
Alternate o’er the ever-sounding shore? 
Or who has eye to trace
How the Plague came? 
Forerun the doublings of the Tempest’s race? 
Or the Air’s weight and flame 
On a set scale explore? 

Thus God has will’d
That man, when fully skill’d, 
Still gropes in twilight dim; 
Encompass’d all his hours 
By fearfullest powers 
Inflexible to him.
That so he may discern 
His feebleness, 
And e’en for earth’s success 
To Him in wisdom turn, 
Who holds for us the keys of either home,
Earth and the world to come.
