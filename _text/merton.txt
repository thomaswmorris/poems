~A DIRGE~

Some one who hears the bugle neigh will know
How cold it is, when sentries die by starlight.

But none who love to hear the hammering drum
Will look, when the betrayer
Laughs in the desert like a broken monument,
Ringing his tongue in the red bell of his head,
Gesturing like a flag.

The air that quivered after the earthquake
(When God died like a thief)
Still plays the ancient forums like pianos;
The treacherous wind, lover of the demented,
Will harp forever in the haunted temples.

What speeches do the birds make
With their beaks, to the desolate dead?
And yet we love those carsick amphitheaters,

Nor hear our messenger come home from hell
With hands shot full of blood.

No one who loves the fleering fife, will feel
The light of morning stab his flesh,

But some who hear the trumpet’s raving, in the ruined sky,
Will dread the burnished helmet of the sun
Whose anger goes before the King.


~SINCERITY~

	_Omnis homo mendax_

As for the liar, fear him less
Than one who thinks himself sincere
Who, having deceived himself,
Can deceive you with a good conscience.

One who doubts his own truth
May mistrust another less:

Knowing, in his own heart,
That all men are liars
He will be less outraged
When he is deceived by another.

So, too, will he sooner believe
In the sincerity of God.

The sincerity of God! Who never justifies
His actions to men! Who makes no bargains
With any other sincerity, because He knows
There is no other! Who does what He pleases
And never protests His innocence!

Which of us can stand the sincerity of God?

Which of us can bear a Lord
Who is neither guilty nor innocent
(Who cannot be innocent because He cannot
be guilty)?

What has our sincerity to do with His
Whose truth is no approval of our truth
And is not judged by anyone,
Even by Himself?

(Yet if I think myself sincere
I will approve the purity of God
Convinced that my own purity
Is approved by Him)

So, when the Lord speaks, we go to sleep
Or turn quickly to some congenial business
Since, as every liar knows,
No man can bear such sincerity.


~THE DARK MORNING~

This is the black day when
Fog rides the ugly air:
Water wades among the buildings
To the prisoner's curled ear.

Then rain, in thin sentences,
Slakes him like danger,
Whose heart is his Germany
Fevered with anger.

This is the dark day when
Locks let the enemy in
Through all the coiling passages of
(Curled ear) my prison!


~NOTES FOR A NEW LITURGY~

There’s a big Zulu runs our congregation
A woe doctor cherubim chaser
Puts his finger on the chief witch
Has a mind to deter foes
Is by the Star Archangel shown a surprise
Writes his letters in vision mentions his B.A.
From many a college
Has a fan to scatter flies
Receives a penetrating look
From an imaginary visitant in white
Knows all the meanings at once
Knows he is in heaven in rectangles
Of invented saints
Flaming with new degrees and orders every day

“I dreamt this Church I dreamt
Seven precious mitres over my head
My word is final.

“I now General Overseer Concession Registrar
Of rains and weather Committeeman
For Pepsi-Cola all over the islands
Flail of incontinent clergy
Wave my highstrung certificate in times of change
Don’t you need a Defender with a medical guarantee?

“You think that I am only a clown-healer from the out-district?
Hold this black bag while I lay hands on children
Steady my followers with magic curios

When I sleep I watch you with eyes in my feet
Last night I dreamt of four beds
I must marry again must go get
Another angel-nun
Come holy deaconess we'll ride
Barefoot in yellow busses to Jordan River
Wearing emblems of the common vow

“Subleaders keep telling the message
Like it was new
Confirming my charism as Prime-Mover in Management
I shall continue in office as President
For all time until the earth melt
As all Full-Leaders stand over you wearing their watches
Moulding you by government of thought
And I return a while to the Origin
Ruling through a female medium from an obscure place:

“HOLD THIS MITRE WHILE I STRANGLE CHICKENS
AND THROW THEM IN THE AIR
COVERING THE SACRED STONE WITH BLOODY FEATHERS
(And surround the altar
With lie detectors.”)


~WITH THE WORLD IN MY BLOODSTREAM~

I lie on my hospital bed
Water runs inside the walls
And the musical machinery
All around overhead
Plays upon my metal system
My invented back bone
Lends to the universal tone
A flat impersonal song
All the planes in my mind
Sing to my worried blood
To my jet streams
I swim in the world’s genius
The spring’s plasm
I wonder who the hell I am.

The world’s machinery
Expands in the walls
Of the hot musical building
Made in maybe twenty-four
And my lost childhood remains
One of the city’s living cells
Thanks to this city
I am still living
But whose life lies here
And whose invented music sings?

All the freights in the night
Swing my dark technical bed
All around overhead
And wake the questions in my blood
My jet streams fly far above
But my low gash is no good
Here below earth and bone
Bleeding in a numbered bed
Though all my veins run
With Christ and with the stars’ plasm.

Ancestors and Indians
Zen Masters and Saints
Parade in the incredible hotel
And dark-eyed Negro mercy bends
And uncertain fibers of the will
Toward recovery and home.
What recovery and what Home?
I have no more sweet home
I doubt the bed here and the road there
And WKLO I most abhor
My head is rotten with the town’s song.

Here below stars and light
And the Chicago plane
Slides up the rainy straits of night
While in my maze I walk and sweat
Wandering in the low bone system
Or searching the impossible ceiling
For the question and the meaning
Till the machine rolls in again
I grow hungry for invented air
And for the technical community of men
For my lost Zen breathing
For the unmarried fancy
And the wild gift I made in those days
For all the compromising answers
All the gambles and blue rhythms
Of individual despair.

So the world’s logic runs
Up and down the doubting walls
While the frights and the planes
Swing my sleep out the window
All around, overhead
In doubt and technical heat
In oxygen and jet streams
In the world’s enormous space
And in man’s enormous want
Until the want itself is gone
Nameless bloodless and alone
The Cross comes and Eckhart’s scandal
The Holy Supper and the precise wrong
And the accurate little spark
In emptiness in the jet stream
Only the spark can understand
All that burns flies upward
Where the rainy jets have gone
A sign of needs and possible homes
An invented back bone
A dull song of oxygen
A lost spark in Eckhart’s Castle.
World’s plasm and world’s cell
I bleed myself awake and well

Only the spark is now true
Dancing in the empty room
All around overhead
While the frail body of Christ
Sweats in a technical bed
I am Christ’s lost cell
His childhood and desert age
His descent into hell.
Love without need and without name
Bleeds in the empty problem
And the spark without identity
Circles the empty ceiling.

~BIRDCAGE WALK~

	I.

One royal afternoon
When I was young and easily surprised   
By uncles coming from the park
At the command of nurses and of guards,

I wondered, over trees and ponds,   
At the sorry, rude walls
And the white windows of the apartments.

“These,” said my uncle, “are the tallest houses.”   


	II.

Yes, in the spring of my joy
When I was visibly affected by a gaitered bishop,   
Large and unsteady in the flagged yard,
Guards, dogs and blackbirds fled on every hand.

“He is an old one,” said uncle,   
“The gaiters are real.”


	III.

Rippled, fistfed windows of your
Dun high houses! Then
Come cages made of pretty willows
Where they put the palace girls!
Green ducks wade slowly from the marble water.   
One swan reproves a saucy daughter.

I consider my own true pond,
Look for the beginning and the end.
I lead the bishop down lanes and islands.


	IV.

Yes, in the windows of my first existence   
Before my yawns became seasons,
When nurses and uncles were sure,   
Chinese fowl fought the frosty water   
Startled by this old pontifex.

“No bridge” (He smiled   
Between the budding branches),
“No crossing to the cage   
Of the paradise bird!”

Astounded by the sermons in the leaves
I cried, “No! No! The stars have higher houses!”

Kicking the robins and ganders   
From the floor of his insular world
The magic bishop leaned his blessing on the children.


	V.

That was the bold day when
Moved by the unexpected summons   
I opened all the palace aviaries   
As by a king’s representative
I was appointed fowler.

~FABLE FOR A WAR~

The old Roman sow   
Bears a new litter now
To fatten for a while
On the same imperial swill.
The cannibal wolf will dig
And root out Spanish bones beside the pig.

Germany has reared   
A rare ugly bird
To screech a sour song   
In the German tongue:   
Tell me if there be
A sparrowhawk for such birds as he?

The parrots lift their beaks
And fill the air with shrieks.
Ambassador is sent
From the parrots’ parliament:
“Oh see how fine I fly
And nibble crackers got in Germany.”

Europe is a feast
For every bloody beast:   
Jackals will grow fat   
On the bones after that.   
But in the end of all
None but the crows can sing the funeral.

Germany has reared
A rare ugly bird,
But crows ate Roman pig
Before this bird was egg.
And in the end of all
Crows will come back and sing the funeral.


~AUBADE-HARLEM~

Across the cages of the keyless aviaries,
The lines and wires, the gallows of the broken kites,   
Crucify, against the fearful light,
The ragged dresses of the little children.
Soon, in the sterile jungles of the waterpipes and ladders,   
The bleeding sun, a bird of prey, will terrify the poor,   
These will forget the unbelievable moon.

But in the cells of whiter buildings,
Where the glass dawn is brighter than the knives of surgeons,   
Paler than alcohol or ether, shinier than money,
The white men’s wives, like Pilate’s,
Cry in the peril of their frozen dreams:

“Daylight has driven iron spikes,
Into the flesh of Jesus’ hands and feet:
Four flowers of blood have nailed Him to the walls of Harlem.”

Along the white halls of the clinics and the hospitals   
Pilate evaporates with a cry:
They have cut down two hundred Judases,
Hanged by the neck in the opera houses and the museum.

Across the cages of the keyless aviaries,
The lines and wires, the gallows of the broken kites,   
Crucify, against the fearful light,
The ragged dresses of the little children.


~AT THIS PRECISE MOMENT OF HISTORY~

1. At this precise moment of history   
    With Goody-two-shoes running for Congress
    We are testing supersonic engines   
    To keep God safe in the cherry tree.   
    When I said so in this space last Thursday   
    I meant what I said: power struggles.

2. You would never dream of such corn. The colonials in   
    sandalwood like running wide open and available for   
    protection. You can throw them away without a refund.

3. Dr. Hanfstaengel who was not called Putzi except by   
    those who did not know him is taped in the national   
    archives. J. Edgar Hoover he ought to know
    And does know.

    But calls Dr. Hanfstaengel Putzi nevertheless   
    Somewhere on tape in the   
    Archives.

    He (Dr. H.) is not a silly man.   
    He left in disgust
    About the same time Shirley Temple
    Sat on Roosevelt’s knee   
    An accomplished pianist
    A remembered personality.   
    He (Dr. H.) began to teach   
    Immortal anecdotes
    To his mother a Queen Bee   
    In the American colony.

4. What is your attitude toward historical subjects?   
    —Perhaps it’s their size!

5. When I said this in space you would never believe   
    Corn Colonel was so expatriated.
    —If you think you know,
    Take this wheel
    And become standard.

6. She is my only living mother
    This bee of the bloody arts
    Bandaging victims of Saturday’s dance   
    Like a veritable sphinx
    In a totally new combination.

7. The Queen Mother is an enduring vignette   
       at an early age.
    Now she ought to be kept in submersible   
       decompression chambers

    For a while.

8. What is your attitude toward historical subjects   
    Like Queen Colonies?
    —They are permanently fortified
    For shape retention.

9. Solid shades   
    Seven zippered pockets   
    Close to my old place
    Waiting by the road
    Big disk brakes
    Spinoff
    Zoom
    Long lights stabbing at the   
    Two together piggyback   
    In a stark sports roadster

    Regretting his previous outburst   
    Al loads his Cadillac   
    With lovenests.

10. She is my only living investment   
      She examines the housing industry   
      Counts 3.5 million postwar children   
      Turning twenty-one
      And draws her own conclusion   
      In the commercial fishing field.

11. Voice of little sexy ventriloquist mignonne:
      “Well I think all of us are agreed and sincerely I my-
      self believe that honest people on both sides have got   
      it all on tape. Governor Reagan thinks that nuclear   
      wampums are a last resort that ought not to be re-
      sorted.” (But little mignonne went right to the point   
      with: “We have a commitment to fulfill and we better   
      do it quick.” No dupe she!)

      All historians die of the same events at least twice.

13. I feel that I ought to open this case with an apology.   
      Dr. H. certainly has a beautiful voice. He is not a silly   
      man. He is misunderstood even by Presidents.

14. You people are criticizing the Church but what are   
      you going to put in her place? Sometime sit down with   
      a pencil and paper and ask yourself what you’ve got   
      that the Church hasn’t.

15. Nothing to add
      But the big voice of a detective   
      Using the wrong first names   
      In national archives.

16. She sat in shocking pink with an industrial zipper spe-
      cially designed for sitting on the knees of presidents in   
      broad daylight. She spoke the president’s mind. “We   
      have a last resort to be resorted and we better do it   
      quick.” He wondered at what he had just said.

17. It was all like running wideopen in a loose gown   
      Without slippers   
      At least someplace.


~ADVICE TO A YOUNG PROPHET~

Keep away, son, these lakes are salt. These flowers   
Eat insects. Here private lunatics   
Yell and skip in a very dry country.

Or where some haywire monument   
Some badfaced daddy of fear   
Commands an unintelligent rite.

To dance on the unlucky mountain,   
To dance they go, and shake the sin   
Out of their feet and hands,

Frenzied until the sudden night   
Falls very quiet, and magic sin   
Creeps, secret, back again.

Badlands echo with omens of ruin:
Seven are very satisfied, regaining possession:   
(Bring a little mescaline, you’ll get along!)

There’s something in your bones,
There’s someone dirty in your critical skin,
There’s a tradition in your cruel misdirected finger   
Which you must obey, and scribble in the hot sand:

“Let everybody come and attend   
Where lights and airs are fixed
To teach and entertain. O watch the sandy people   
Hopping in the naked bull’s-eye,

Shake the wildness out of their limbs,
Try to make peace like John in skins
Elijah in the timid air   
or Anthony in tombs:

Pluck the imaginary trigger, brothers.   
Shoot the devil: he’ll be back again!”

America needs these fatal friends
Of God and country, to grovel in mystical ashes,   
Pretty big prophets whose words don’t burn,   
Fighting the strenuous imago all day long.

Only these lunatics, (O happy chance)
Only these are sent. Only this anaemic thunder   
Grumbles on the salt flats, in rainless night:

O go home, brother, go home!   
The devil’s back again,
And magic Hell is swallowing flies.
