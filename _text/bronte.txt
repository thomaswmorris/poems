~REMEMBRANCE~

Cold in the earth—and the deep snow piled above thee, 
Far, far removed, cold in the dreary grave! 
Have I forgot, my only Love, to love thee, 
Severed at last by Time's all-severing wave? 

Now, when alone, do my thoughts no longer hover 
Over the mountains, on that northern shore, 
Resting their wings where heath and fern-leaves cover 
Thy noble heart forever, ever more? 

Cold in the earth—and fifteen wild Decembers, 
From those brown hills, have melted into spring: 
Faithful, indeed, is the spirit that remembers 
After such years of change and suffering! 

Sweet Love of youth, forgive, if I forget thee, 
While the world's tide is bearing me along; 
Other desires and other hopes beset me, 
Hopes which obscure, but cannot do thee wrong! 

No later light has lightened up my heaven, 
No second morn has ever shone for me; 
All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given, 
All my life's bliss is in the grave with thee. 

But, when the days of golden dreams had perished, 
And even Despair was powerless to destroy, 
Then did I learn how existence could be cherished, 
Strengthened, and fed without the aid of joy. 

Then did I check the tears of useless passion— 
Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine; 
Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten 
Down to that tomb already more than mine. 

And, even yet, I dare not let it languish, 
Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous pain; 
Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish, 
How could I seek the empty world again? 


~NO COWARD SOUL IS MINE~

No coward soul is mine
No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere
I see Heaven's glories shine
And Faith shines equal arming me from Fear

O God within my breast
Almighty ever-present Deity
Life, that in me hast rest,
As I Undying Life, have power in Thee

Vain are the thousand creeds
That move men's hearts, unutterably vain,
Worthless as withered weeds
Or idlest froth amid the boundless main

To waken doubt in one
Holding so fast by thy infinity,
So surely anchored on
The steadfast rock of Immortality.

With wide-embracing love
Thy spirit animates eternal years
Pervades and broods above,
Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates and rears

Though earth and moon were gone
And suns and universes ceased to be
And Thou wert left alone
Every Existence would exist in thee

There is not room for Death
Nor atom that his might could render void
Since thou art Being and Breath
And what thou art may never be destroyed.


~I AM THE ONLY BEING WHOSE DOOM~

I am the only being whose doom
No tongue would ask, no eye would mourn;
I never caused a thought of gloom,
A smile of joy, since I was born.

In secret pleasure, secret tears,
This changeful life has slipped away,
As friendless after eighteen years,
As lone as on my natal day.

There have been times I cannot hide,
There have been times when this was drear,
When my sad soul forgot its pride
And longed for one to love me here.

But those were in the early glow
Of feelings since subdued by care;
And they have died so long ago,
I hardly now believe they were.

First melted off the hope of youth,
Then fancy’s rainbow fast withdrew;
And then experience told me truth
In mortal bosoms never grew.

’Twas grief enough to think mankind
All hollow, servile, insincere;
But worse to trust to my own mind
And find the same corruption there.


~FALL, LEAVES, FALL~

Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.


~SHALL EARTH NO MORE INSPIRE THEE~

Shall earth no more inspire thee,
Thou lonely dreamer now?
Since passion may not fire thee
Shall Nature cease to bow?

Thy mind is ever moving
In regions dark to thee;
Recall its useless roving--
Come back and dwell with me.

I know my mountain breezes
Enchant and soothe thee still--
I know my sunshine pleases
Despite thy wayward will.

When day with evening blending
Sinks from the summer sky,
I’ve seen thy spirit bending
In fond idolatry.

I’ve watched thee every hour;
I know my mighty sway,
I know my magic power
To drive thy griefs away.

Few hearts to mortals given
On earth so wildly pine;
Yet none would ask a heaven
More like this earth than thine.

Then let my winds caress thee;
Thy comrade let me be--
Since nought beside can bless thee,
Return and dwell with me.


~THE TWO CHILDREN~

Heavy hangs the raindrop 
From the burdened spray; 
Heavy broods the damp mist 
On uplands far away; 

Heavy looms the dull sky, 
Heavy rolls the sea-- 
And heavy beats the young heart 
Beneath that lonely tree. 

Never has a blue streak 
Cleft the clouds since morn-- 
Never has his grim Fate 
Smiled since he was born. 

Frowning on the infant, 
Shadowing childhood’s joy, 
Guardian angel knows not 
That melancholy boy. 

Day is passing swiftly 
Its sad and sombre prime; 
Youth is fast invading 
Sterner manhood’s time. 

All the flowers are praying 
For sun before they close, 
And he prays too, unknowing, 
That sunless human rose! 

Blossoms, that the west wind 
Has never wooed to blow, 
Scentless are your petals, 
Your dew as cold as snow. 

Soul, where kindred kindness 
No early promise woke, 
Barren is your beauty 
As weed upon the rock. 

Wither, Brothers, wither, 
You were vainly given-- 
Earth reserves no blessing 
For the unblessed of Heaven! 

Child of Delight! with sunbright hair, 
And seablue, seadeep eyes; 
Spirit of Bliss, what brings thee here, 
Beneath these sullen skies? 

Thou shouldst live in eternal spring, 
Where endless day is never dim; 
Why, seraph, has thy erring wing 
Borne thee down to weep with him? 

“Ah, not from heaven am I descended, 
And I do not come to mingle tears; 
But sweet is day, though with shadows blended; 
And, though clouded, sweet are youthful years. 

“I, the image of light and gladness, 
Saw and pitied that mournful boy, 
And I swore to take his gloomy sadness, 
And give to him my beamy joy. 

“Heavy and dark the night is closing; 
Heavy and dark may its biding be: 
Better for all from grief reposing, 
And better for all who watch like me. 

“Guardian angel, he lacks no longer; 
Evil fortune he need not fear: 
Fate is strong, but Love is stronger; 
And more unsleeping than angel’s care.”
